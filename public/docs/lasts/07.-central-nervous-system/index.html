  The Central Nervous System
  #

The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord (spinal medulla). Developmentally, the brain consists of the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. The forebrain is composed of the cerebrum (the two cerebral hemispheres, each with a cavity, the lateral ventricle), and a deeper central portion, the diencephalon, whose main parts are the thalamus and hypothalamus and whose cavity is the third ventricle. Despite this academic distinction between parts, each half of the forebrain is commonly called simply the cerebral hemisphere. The midbrain is a small region whose cavity is the aqueduct and which connects the forebrain with the hindbrain, consisting of the pons, medulla oblongata, and cerebellum and whose cavity is the fourth ventricle. The midbrain, pons, and medulla collectively form the brainstem. All parts of the brain are contained within the cranial cavity; the medulla passes through the foramen magnum of the skull and changes its name to spinal cord where the first cervical nerve roots emerge. Cerebrospinal fluid is produced by the choroid plexuses within parts of the ventricles; its only exit is through foramina in the roof of the fourth ventricle, in the medulla.">

  The Central Nervous System
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-central-nervous-system">#</a>
</h1>
<p>The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord (spinal medulla). Developmentally, the brain consists of the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. The forebrain is composed of the cerebrum (the two cerebral hemispheres, each with a cavity, the lateral ventricle), and a deeper central portion, the diencephalon, whose main parts are the thalamus and hypothalamus and whose cavity is the third ventricle. Despite this academic distinction between parts, each half of the forebrain is commonly called simply the cerebral hemisphere. The midbrain is a small region whose cavity is the aqueduct and which connects the forebrain with the hindbrain, consisting of the pons, medulla oblongata, and cerebellum and whose cavity is the fourth ventricle. The midbrain, pons, and medulla collectively form the brainstem. All parts of the brain are contained within the cranial cavity; the medulla passes through the foramen magnum of the skull and changes its name to spinal cord where the first cervical nerve roots emerge. Cerebrospinal fluid is produced by the choroid plexuses within parts of the ventricles; its only exit is through foramina in the roof of the fourth ventricle, in the medulla.</p>
<p>The cerebral hemispheres occupy the greater part of the cranial cavity, above the floors of the anterior and middle cranial fossae, and above the tentorium cerebelli. One hemisphere, usually the left in right-handed people, is slightly larger than the other and constitutes the dominant hemisphere. The medial surface of each hemisphere is flat and lies against the falx cerebri; below the falx, the two hemispheres are joined by the corpus callosum. The undersurface of the hemisphere is more irregular than the medial surface; the orbital surface of the frontal lobe is slightly concave from the impression of the anterior cranial fossa, the temporal pole is boldly convex in conformity with the middle cranial fossa, while the undersurface of the occipital lobe slopes downwards and outwards to conform with the shape of the tentorium. The undersurfaces of the two hemispheres are joined by the cerebral peduncles of the midbrain; anteriorly lie the structures of the undersurface of the diencephalon (Fig. 7.22). The lateral surfaces of the hemispheres are boldly convex in conformity with the shape of the skull; the more complete term &ldquo;superolateral&rdquo; is usually applied to this convex surface.</p>
<p>All surfaces of the cerebral hemisphere are covered with a cortex of grey matter (the cells of the cerebral cortex), and internally there are further groups of cells that form such structures as the basal nuclei and thalamus. The cortex is thrown into a complicated series of tortuous folds, the gyri; the grooves between them are the sulci (Fig. 7.1). All the gyri and sulci are named, but only the most important are here described. Although the patterns of no two brains are identical, there is always an underlying similarity, and this general pattern common to all must be appreciated.</p>
<p>Some of the larger sulci are used to divide the surface of the hemisphere into lobes which are named according to the cranial bones that lie adjacent when the brain is in situ: frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. Further details are given below, but the essential features can be summarized by stating that the frontal lobe lies in front of the central sulcus and above the lateral sulcus; the parietal lobe is behind the central sulcus and above the lateral sulcus; the temporal lobe is below the lateral sulcus; and the occipital lobe lies below and behind the parieto-occipital sulcus.</p>
<p>A deep fissure that separates the frontal and temporal lobes on the undersurface of the brain is continued to the lateral surface and passes backwards, above the temporal lobe. This is the lateral sulcus (fissure of Sylvius) (Fig. 7.1), although strictly speaking the part on the lateral surface is the posterior ramus of the lateral sulcus, for, at the front end of this part, there are short anterior and ascending rami that branch off from it to penetrate the inferior frontal gyrus. The areas of cortex bounding the short sulci are the orbital, triangular, and opercular parts of the inferior frontal gyrus, and they have to be noted because on the left hemisphere this is the region of the motor speech area (of Broca, p. 586). The triangular part with the adjacent areas of parietal and temporal cortex form the opercula which overlie a buried part of the cortex, the insula (Fig. 7.2), composed of various long and short gyri almost completely surrounded by the circular sulcus.</p>
<p>The opercula indent the superior border of the hemisphere just behind the midpoint. It is the only long sulcus to pass over onto the medial surface of the hemisphere. This is the central sulcus (fissure of Rolando) and it separates frontal and parietal lobes (Fig. 7.1). The precentral and postcentral gyri lie in front of and behind it; they contain the motor and sensory cortical areas. In front of the precentral gyrus, the frontal lobe is divided by two horizontal sulci into three gyri, the superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyri. A similar arrangement divides the temporal lobe below the lateral sulcus into superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyri. Note that the central sulcus does not usually run directly into the lateral sulcus - a useful point when identifying the central sulcus.</p>
<p>The parietal lobe is divided by a transverse sulcus into superior and inferior parietal lobules. Into the latter project the lateral sulcus and the superior.</p>
<p>An imaginary line divides the occipital lobe from the parietal and temporal lobes. It extends from the small part of the parieto-occipital sulcus visible on this lateral surface, downwards in a 45° slope to the inferior border where there is often a slight preoccipital notch (Fig. 7.2) indented in the border by a fold of dura mater over the transverse sinus. A further arbitrary line, carried backwards from the main direction of the lateral sulcus until it meets the occipital demarcation line, indicates where the parietal and temporal lobes join.</p>
<p>The two medial surfaces are flat and lie close together; they can be inspected only when their midline connections are divided by sagittal section (Fig. 7.3). Such a section severs the corpus callosum and the roof and floor of the third ventricle, as well as the brainstem and cerebellum if these are still attached to the cerebral hemispheres. The wall of the third ventricle thus exposed beneath the corpus callosum is described on page 593. The medial surface of the hemisphere above the corpus callosum forms the cingulate gyrus, above which is the cingulate sulcus. Above the sulcus, the medial frontal gyrus extends, anteriorly, to the superior border of the hemisphere. Just behind the midpoint of the superior border, the central sulcus turns onto the medial surface; it is enclosed in the paracentral lobule.</p>
<p>At the posterior end of the hemisphere, the oblique parieto-occipital sulcus separates the parietal from the occipital lobe; it extends over the superior border to appear, as previously noted, on the superolateral surface. The medial surface of the occipital lobe is wedge-shaped and is named the cuneus. Between the parieto-occipital sulcus and the paracentral lobule is the precuneus.</p>
<p>The cuneus is limited inferiorly by the calcarine sulcus which runs forward from the occipital pole to the medial surface of the temporal lobe. The sulcus is of great importance because of the associated visual area of the cortex (p. 586). The parieto-occipital sulcus runs into it. In old terminology, the part of the calcarine sulcus below the cuneus was called the posterior calcarine sulcus. Note that the parieto-occipital and calcarine sulci form an easily identifiable pattern like the letter Y on its side; the common stem of the Y is the anterior part of the calcarine sulcus, and the two limbs are the parieto-occipital sulcus and the posterior part of the calcarine sulcus.</p>
<p>The lingual gyrus lies below the posterior part of the calcarine sulcus and is limited at the border between the medial and inferior surfaces of the occipital lobe by the collateral sulcus (see below).</p>
<p>The medial surface of the temporal lobe can be seen fully only when the cerebral peduncles are divided and the brainstem removed. It is best studied with the choroid fissure (p. 597).</p>
<h2 id="inferior-surface">
  Inferior Surface
  <a class="anchor" href="#inferior-surface">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The orbital surface of the frontal lobe has the straight gyrus rectus along its medial margin. Lying on the gyrus rectus is the olfactory bulb. The olfactory tract runs in the olfactory sulcus alongside the gyrus rectus. Lateral to the olfactory bulb and tract, this surface is gently concave and is divided into a series of orbital gyri and sulci which leave prominent impressions on the orbital part of the frontal bone.</p>
<p>The temporal pole is boldly convex; the temporal lobe merges posteriorly with the occipital lobe, and the continuous surface so formed is concave and oblique in conformity with the slope of the tentorium cerebelli, against which it lies. Hence much of the medial surface of the temporal lobe can be seen from the inferior view; the tentorial surface under review is really inferomedial on the hemisphere. It is characterized by two long parallel sulci, the occipitotemporal sulcus laterally and the collateral sulcus medially (Fig. 7.3A). They run anteroposteriorly between the temporal and occipital poles. Medial to the collateral sulcus is the parahippocampal gyrus, confined to the temporal lobe and recurved anteriorly to form the uncus (Fig. 7.3A); at the back, it may appear to become continuous with the front of the lingual gyrus.</p>
<p>Between the temporal poles, the midline structures inferior to the floor of the third ventricle can be seen. They lie in front of the cerebral peduncles of the midbrain and are bounded in front by the optic chiasma. From the chiasma, the optic tracts diverge around the cerebral peduncles, high up under cover of the temporal lobe. Behind the chiasma lies a rounded elevation, the tuber cinereum, from which the pituitary stalk projects downwards in the intact brain. Behind the tuber cinereum are the rounded eminences of the mamillary bodies and, behind these, deep in the angle between the cerebral peduncles, the posterior perforated substance (Fig. 7.4).</p>
<p>On the inferior surface of the frontal lobe immediately lateral to the chiasma is the anterior perforated substance; the medial and lateral divisions of the olfactory tract can be seen diverging around this area (Fig. 7.4).</p>
<h2 id="internal-structure">
  Internal Structure
  <a class="anchor" href="#internal-structure">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The interior of the cerebrum is characterized by the presence within the white matter of large masses of grey matter and also by cavities which contain the cerebrospinal fluid. The largest mass of cells in each hemisphere is the thalamus. It belongs to the diencephalon, the central part of the forebrain, and is described on page 595.</p>
<p>Other cell groups belong to the lateral part of the forebrain, and some of them constitute the basal nuclei (still commonly called by their old name, basal ganglia). They are usually classified anatomically as consisting of the caudate nucleus, lentiform nucleus (which has an outer part, the putamen, and an inner part, the globus pallidus), the amygdaloid body, and the claustrum. Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what should be included among the basal nuclei; the amygdaloid body is often excluded and placed among the components of the limbic system because of its association with memory and behavior, while the substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus (although mainly in the midbrain rather than the cerebrum) are often included because of their profuse connections with the lentiform nucleus. However, among these uncertainties, there are two highly important and universally recognized facts: (1) the caudate nucleus and the putamen part of the lentiform nucleus are joined by many interconnecting fibers to form what is collectively known as the corpus striatum (from the striated naked-eye appearance), and (2) fibers from the globus pallidus part of the lentiform nucleus form the main efferent pathway from the corpus striatum.</p>
<p>The caudate nucleus has the shape of a highly curved comma (Figs 7.5 and 7.6) with a head, body, and tail. The bulbous head tapers back to the body which, curving back round the lateral part of the thalamus, bends sharply forwards into the long thin tail that joins the amygdaloid body. The caudate nucleus is curled snugly round the internal capsule like a hand holding a bunch of flowers. The whole length of its convexity projects into the lateral ventricle.</p>
<p>The lentiform nucleus is the shape of a biconvex lens, completely buried in the hemisphere (Figs 7.6 and 7.7). It is oval in outline and has two parts: the large lateral putamen, curved and roughly quadrilateral in shape, and the small medial globus pallidus, bluntly conical. The putamen is joined to the head of the caudate nucleus by bundles of myelinated and unmyelinated fibers which, by passing through the anterior part of the internal capsule, give the area a striated appearance.</p>
<p>As noted above, the corpus striatum is the collective name for the caudate nucleus and the putamen part of the lentiform nucleus.</p>
<p>The amygdaloid body (often called the amygdala by clinicians) consists of several nuclear masses and is connected with the tip of the tail of the caudate nucleus in the roof of the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle. It is functionally part of the limbic system (p. 588).</p>
<p>The claustrum is a thin lamina, circular in outline and curved into a saucer-shape. It lies lateral to the putamen, and although easy to identify in horizontal or coronal sections (e.g., Fig. 7.7), its significance is unknown.</p>
<p>Other functional components of the basal nuclei are considered elsewhere: the subthalamic nucleus on page 594, and the substantia nigra on page 606.</p>
<p>Functionally, the basal nuclei exert a supraspinal control over skeletal muscle movements by influencing their rate, range, and coordination. The corpus striatum, often called simply the striatum by neurologists, can be regarded as the input side of the basal nuclei, receiving fibers mainly from the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and substantia nigra. The globus pallidus (the &ldquo;pallidum&rdquo;) is the output side, sending fibers to the thalamus, and also to the subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, and the reticular formation. The fibers to the thalamus run in two large bundles, the ansa lenticularis and the ansa fascicularis, which pass ventral and dorsal to the subthalamic nucleus respectively. The ansa fascicularis passes through the fibers of the internal capsule, as does another bundle, the subthalamic fasciculus, interconnecting the globus pallidus and the subthalamic nucleus. Thus, there are, for example, cortico-striato-pallido-thalamo-cortical pathways by which these subcortical cell groups can exert their influence on movement.</p>
<p>Different pathways involve different transmitters which include acetylcholine, dopamine, glutamate, serotonin, and GABA. The commonest disease of the basal nuclei is parkinsonism, characterized by tremor, rigidity, and akinesia; there is a decrease of dopamine in the nigrostriatal pathway.</p>
<p>Commissural fibers join the cortices of the two hemispheres. Most of them are gathered together in the corpus callosum; a few lie in the anterior, posterior, and habenular commissures. They radiate widely and symmetrically through the white matter of the hemispheres.</p>
<p>Association (arcuate) fibers are confined to their own hemisphere, in which they connect different parts of the cortex.</p>
<p>Projection fibers are those which join the grey matter of the hemisphere with subcortical nuclei in the hemispheres and with nuclei in the brainstem and spinal cord. The verb &ldquo;project&rdquo; is often used to indicate a connection between one structure and another, e.g., the caudate nucleus projects to the putamen, meaning that the axons of the cell bodies in the caudate nucleus pass to make synaptic connection with cell bodies in the putamen. In the base of the hemisphere, a major collection of projection fibers lies lateral to the thalamus and the head of the caudate nucleus, forming the internal capsule. The lentiform nucleus lies lateral to the internal capsule, and the tail of the caudate nucleus curls around, also lateral (Fig. 7.5). From the internal capsule, the fibers radiate upwards and outwards in the shape of a curved fan to reach the cortex and similarly pass from the cortex down to the capsule; this fan-shaped arrangement is the corona radiata. Fibers of the corpus callosum intersect it.</p>
<p>The internal capsule consists of afferent fibers passing up to the cortex from cell bodies in the thalamus, and of efferent fibers passing down from cell bodies in the cortex to the cerebral peduncle of the midbrain. It lies within the concavity of the C-shaped caudate nucleus, which separates it from the C-shaped concavity of the lateral ventricle (Figs 7.5 and 7.7).</p>
<p>The internal capsule is seen in a typical horizontal section through the hemisphere (e.g., at a level through the interventricular foramen and the pineal body) as a band of white matter that is not a straight line but bent into a lateral concavity by the convex medial border of the lentiform nucleus (i.e., by the globus pallidus). Because of this almost L-shape, the internal capsule is described as having an anterior limb, genu, and posterior limb, and there are also two other portions posteriorly: the sublentiform and retrolentiform parts.</p>
<p>The anterior limb lies between the head of the caudate nucleus medially and the lentiform nucleus laterally. It contains frontopontine fibers from cell bodies in the frontal cortex. They pass down below the thalamus into the cerebral peduncle, where they occupy the medial third of the base of the peduncle. They arborize round the pontine nuclei. The anterior limb also probably contains fibers running from the frontal eye field to the oculomotor nucleus, concerned with the accommodation-convergence reflex (p. 518).</p>
<p>The genu is the region of the bend in the capsule (as seen in horizontal section), at the apex of the globus pallidus. Its principal constituents are the corticonuclear fibers which pass from the cerebral cortex to the motor nuclei of cranial nerves in the brainstem (p. 612).</p>
<p>The posterior limb lies between the thalamus medially and the lentiform nucleus laterally. Occupying the anterior two-thirds of the posterior limb (right behind the corticonuclear fibers in the genu) are the corticospinal fibers. From cell bodies in the cortex, the fibers pass down through this part of the capsule, then through the brainstem to the lower medulla where most of them decussate to form the lateral corticospinal tract and eventually arborize with the anterior horn cells that innervate skeletal muscle. Thus, passing through a small part of the internal capsule - genu and anterior two-thirds of the posterior limb - are the motor fibers that control all the skeletal muscle in the body. The head (corticonuclear) fibers lie most anteriorly, and immediately behind them are corticospinal fibers for the arm, hand, trunk, leg, and perineum in that order from front to back. (In the cerebral peduncle of the midbrain, the head fibers lie medially and the fibers for the perineum laterally, in the same order). It is in this part of the internal capsule that hemorrhage or thrombosis of a striate artery commonly occurs. The muscles of the opposite side of the body are thus paralyzed; they become spastic with increased stretch reflexes, the signs of an upper motor neuron lesion (p. 625). Fibers from the speech (Broca&rsquo;s) area are interrupted in lesions of the left internal capsule; thus, loss of speech accompanies hemiplegia of the right side of the body.</p>
<p>Beside and behind the corticospinal fibers in the posterior limb of the capsule, there are thalamocortical fibers passing from cell bodies in the thalamus to the cerebral cortex. These include sensory fibers mediating impulses derived from the opposite side of the body which run upwards through the corona radiata to the sensory cortex. There are also large numbers of corticopontine fibers.</p>
<p>In the retrolentiform part of the capsule, at the posterior end of the lentiform nucleus, are parieto-, occipito-, and temporopontine (corticopontine) fibers which will occupy the lateral third of the base of the cerebral peduncle. But much more importantly, this part of the capsule contains visual fibers passing from cell bodies in the lateral geniculate body to the visual area of the cortex as the optic radiation (p. 587). A further group of fibers runs from the medial geniculate body below the posterior end of the lentiform nucleus, so forming the sublentiform part of the capsule. These are the fibers of the auditory radiation which reach the auditory area of the cortex in the superior temporal gyrus (p. 586).</p>
<p>Although the corticopontine fibers (about 20 million) form the largest group of internal capsule components, the corticonuclear, corticospinal, and thalamocortical fibers and those of the optic radiation are of greater clinical importance, though much smaller in number.</p>
<p>The corpus callosum (Fig. 7.3) consists of a mass of 100 million commissural fibers, each of which extends from cortex to cortex between symmetrical parts of the two hemispheres. It commences at the anterior commissure, at the upper end of the lamina terminalis of the diencephalon and, traced from here to its termination, it becomes increasingly thicker. It is described as having four parts: the rostrum, genu, body, and splenium. From the anterior commissure, the mass passes upwards and forwards as the rostrum. It now takes a sharp bend backwards as the genu. From here, it is gently convex upwards (the body of the corpus callosum) and it ends posteriorly as a thick rounded free border, the splenium. The corpus callosum can be seen by separating the two hemispheres, and its cut surface is exposed in a midline sagittal section through the brain (Fig. 7.11).</p>
<p>The fibers of the corpus callosum extend to all parts of the cerebral cortex. In a horizontal section, the fibers of the genu are seen arching forwards on each side to the frontal cortex; this appearance gives them the name forceps minor. Similarly, the fibers of the massive splenium curve backwards symmetrically to the occipital cortex, forming the forceps major (Fig. 7.7).</p>
<p>Between forceps minor and forceps major, the fibers of the corpus callosum spread out to the cortex on the lateral surface of the hemisphere. They pass across the anterior horn and body of the lateral ventricle, for each of which they form the roof. As they turn down into the temporal lobe, they form the lateral wall of the inferior and posterior horns of the lateral ventricle, where they are known as the tapetum.</p>
<h2 id="cortical-areas">
  Cortical Areas
  <a class="anchor" href="#cortical-areas">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Certain areas of the cerebral cortex have long been identified with specific functions. Although these areas are still clinically relevant, modern investigations are modifying traditional concepts as far as the separation of motor and sensory functions is concerned. Many motor fibers, for example, have their origin outside the traditional motor cortex, and some arise from what were previously regarded as purely sensory areas. A new terminology has emerged, and it is now customary to refer to a combined sensorimotor cortex, subdividing it into four areas designated by the letters Ms and Sm - the capital M or S indicating whether the association is predominantly with motor or sensory functions. Thus, the area MsI (first or primary motosensory area) includes the old motor and premotor regions of the precentral and other gyri of the frontal lobe (corresponding to areas 4 and 6 as described by Brodmann in his now classical study of cortical histology). The area MsII (the supplementary motor area) is on part of the medial surface of the frontal lobe (part of areas 6 and 8). Similarly, SmI (first sensorimotor area) includes most of the postcentral gyrus (areas 3, 1, and 2) and its extension onto the medial surface of the parietal lobe, and SmII is the lowest part of the postcentral gyrus (areas 40 and 43). These four main motor and sensory areas have many interconnections, both within their own and with the opposite hemisphere.</p>
<p>The MsI area is concerned with postural mechanisms, but this area is not yet clearly understood. In the precentral gyrus of MsI, the body is represented upside down along this cortex, although the face itself is represented the right way up. The face lies lowest, then the hand (a very large area), then arm, trunk, and leg. The leg and perineum areas overlap the superior border and extend down on the medial surface of the hemisphere into the paracentral lobule.</p>
<p>The motor (anterior) speech area (of Broca, areas 44 and 45) is usually situated in the inferior frontal gyrus on the left side (in right-handed and in most left-handed people), below and in front of the face area and centered on the pars triangularis between the anterior and ascending rami of the lateral fissure. Damage to it produces motor aphasia - difficulty in finding the right words, but not paralysis of laryngeal musculature.</p>
<p>The posterior speech area (of Wernicke) is in the posterior parts of the superior and middle temporal gyri and extends into the lower part of the parietal lobe. Its integrity is necessary for the understanding of speech.</p>
<p>The frontal eye field, involved in voluntary eye movements and the accommodation pathway (p. 519), is in the center of the middle frontal gyrus (parts of areas 6, 8, and 9).</p>
<p>The areas SmI and SmII receive a large thalamic input. SmI is for the appreciation of touch, kinesthetic, and vibration sense, and the parts of the body are represented in roughly the same way as in MsI. SmII appears to be associated with pain and temperature sensations. Although the conscious appreciation of pain may occur at the thalamic level, the cortex is necessary for its localization.</p>
<p>The gustatory area for the conscious appreciation of taste lies in the inferior part of the postcentral gyrus (frontoparietal operculum), near the tongue area of SmI.</p>
<p>The auditory area (areas 41 and 42) is mostly hidden in the lateral sulcus, in the anterior transverse temporal gyrus. It extends into the superior temporal gyrus below the sulcus, and is here surrounded by the auditory association area (area 22). These regions receive fibers from the medial geniculate body via the auditory radiation. The cochleae are bilaterally represented, so a lesion of one cortex does not cause deafness.</p>
<p>The olfactory area is in the uncus at the front of the parahippocampal gyrus (Fig. 7.3A) and adjacent parts of the cortex.</p>
<p>The visual area (area 17) is mainly on the medial surface of the occipital lobe in the depths of the calcarine sulcus; more precisely, it lies along the lower lip of the anterior part of the sulcus and along both upper and lower lips of the posterior part, and it extends for a short distance (1 cm or so) onto the lateral surface of the occipital lobe as far as the lunate sulcus. The true visual area is characterized by a white line (stria of Gennari) which bisects the grey matter of the cortex; in cortical sections, it is easily seen with the naked eye, hence the name striate cortex often given to this area. The cortex adjacent to the striate part on the medial and lateral surfaces of the hemisphere (and which does not have the stria) forms the visual association area (areas 18 and 19).</p>
<p>Each visual area receives from its own half of each retina, i.e., it registers the opposite visual field. In each cortex, the upper half receives from the upper half of each half-retina, the lower half from the lower half of each half-retina, i.e., the upper and lower visual fields are crossed. The macula registers at the posterior end of the visual area and more peripheral parts of the retina progressively more anteriorly. When thinking about visual anatomy, do not confuse parts of the visual fields with parts of the retina. The temporal (lateral) half of the visual field of one eye conveys its impressions to the nasal (medial) half of the retina of that eye; similarly, the temporal half of the retina receives its impressions from the nasal half of the visual field.</p>
<p>The peripheral nerves of ordinary sensation, with their cell bodies in posterior root ganglia, are represented in the visual pathway by the bipolar cells of the retina (Fig. 7.8A). These cells receive impulses from the retinal rods and cones. The bipolar cells synapse with ganglion cells in the inner part of the retina (1 cell for each cone, 1 cell for 80 rods). These are homologous with the second neuron cell bodies in the central nervous system in the other sensory pathways. Their axons run on the surface of the retina and enter the optic disc and so pass to the optic nerve.</p>
<p>The optic nerve is not a nerve in the sense of the other cranial and spinal nerves; it is an elongated tract of white matter stretched out from the brain and enclosed in the meninges thereof as far forward as its attachment to the sclera. Histologically, it is identical with white matter of the central nervous system, and there is no effective regeneration when divided. In the orbit, it is surrounded by a tube of dura mater and arachnoid, with cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space. At the optic foramen, the dura and arachnoid leave it, and the nerve, still sheathed in pia mater, passes up to meet its fellow at the optic chiasma, which is attached to the anterior part of the floor of the third ventricle.</p>
<p>In the chiasma, the nasal fibers of each optic nerve decussate and pass into the optic tract of the opposite side; the temporal fibers from each retina pass on to their own side (Fig. 7.8A). Thus, the right optic tract contains fibers from the right half of each retina, i.e., it carries impressions from the nasal field of the right eye and the temporal field of the left eye. Likewise, the left optic tract contains fibers from the left half of each retina, and since there is no further decussation, this holds true right back to the visual cortex.</p>
<p>Cortical pathways for common sensation consist of three neurons. They reach the opposite hemisphere by a complete decussation of the second order neurons. The visual pathway by the half decussation of its second order neurons at the chiasma achieves the same object. There is complete crossing of the visual fields. One hemisphere registers common sensation from the opposite half of the body and also from the opposite half of the visible environment.</p>
<p>The optic tract passes from the chiasma around the cerebral peduncle, high up against the temporal lobe and, reaching the side of the thalamus, divides into two branches. The larger of these enters the lateral geniculate body, in which the fibers synapse. These are visual fibers. The smaller branch (superior brachium - see below) passes down medially, between the lateral and medial geniculate bodies, and synapses in the superior colliculus and the pretectal nuclei; these are fibers mediating light reflexes (p. 518).</p>
<p><strong>Blood supply.</strong> The optic tract is supplied chiefly by the anterior choroidal and posterior communicating arteries, the chiasma and intracranial part of the optic nerve by the anterior cerebral. In the orbit, the nerve is supplied by the ophthalmic artery and, distally, by the central artery on its way to the retina.</p>
<p>The lateral geniculate body, which is a part of the thalamus, is a small rounded elevation below the pulvinar on the posterior surface of the thalamus; identify it by following the optic tract backwards into it (Fig. 7.4). From the ganglion cells of the second neuron (in the retina), axons pass in the optic nerve, chiasma, and optic tract to synapse with cells in six layers of the geniculate body. The fibers from the half-retina of the same side (i.e., temporal fibers) synapse at layers 2, 3, and 5, those from the half-retina of the opposite side (i.e., nasal fibers) synapse at layers 1, 4, and 6. From these layers, the cell bodies send their axons through the optic radiation to the occipital cortex (Fig. 7.7). Because these fibers are proceeding from the lateral geniculate body to the visual cortex which largely borders the calcarine sulcus, the optic radiation is sometimes called the geniculocalcarine tract.</p>
<p>The superior brachium is the (medial) branch of the optic tract. It passes down on the thalamus to the midbrain, where it ends in the tectum. The fibers in the superior brachium arborize around cells in the superior colliculus. The cell bodies in the superior colliculus send their fibers, by tectobulbar and tectospinal tracts, to motor nuclei in the brainstem and spinal cord for the mediation of general light reflexes (e.g., reflex blinking and jumping or turning away from a flash of bright light). The superior colliculi are united by the posterior commissure (at the entrance to the aqueduct, Fig. 7.11), and thus general body reflexes to light are usually bilateral. The special fibers concerned in the pupillary light reflex (p. 518) do not synapse in the colliculus, but pass bilaterally to each pretectal nucleus. The pretectal nucleus is a small group of cells lying in the tegmentum under the upper and lateral margin of the superior colliculus. It passes light impulses to each Edinger-Westphal nucleus and so to the sphincter pupillae. A lesion here produces the Argyll Robertson pupil; contraction to light is lost, but the pupil still contracts to accommodation and convergence. (The pathway of these reflexes is explained on p. 518.)</p>
<p>Surrounding the corpus callosum and diencephalon are a number of features that have come to be known collectively as the limbic system. Because the olfactory tracts and its associated structures were originally included in this descriptive concept, much of its function was thought to be concerned with olfaction. However, this view is no longer tenable, and it is now known to play a role in such abstract functions as behavior, mood, and memory; thus, lesions of one of its major constituents, the hippocampus, result in loss of memory for recent events, although the memory of distant events is retained. Much remains to be discovered, but for the present purpose, it is sufficient to note the component parts and to comment on selected items that have not been mentioned previously.</p>
<p>Apart from the olfactory nerves, bulb, and tract (see below), the following are among the major components of the limbic system:</p>
<ol>
<li>The septal and piriform areas of cerebral cortex, near the lamina terminalis (anterior boundary of the third ventricle, p. 592).</li>
<li>The uncus (p. 581), the insula (p. 578), and the cingulate and parahippocampal gyri (pp. 579 and 581).</li>
<li>The amygdaloid body (p. 582).</li>
<li>The hippocampus, fimbria, fornix, and mamillary body (see below).</li>
</ol>
<p>Some authorities would also include the hypothalamus and the anterior part of the thalamus in view of their functional connections with limbic structures. There is as yet no universal agreement on what should be included.</p>
<h2 id="olfactory-pathways">
  Olfactory Pathways
  <a class="anchor" href="#olfactory-pathways">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The olfactory tract, which is an elongated extension of the white matter of the brain (like the optic nerve), lies in the olfactory sulcus beside the gyrus rectus on the inferior surface of the frontal lobe (Fig. 7.4). Its anterior end is expanded as the olfactory bulb, containing the mitral cells with which the olfactory nerve filaments synapse after passing through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid (p. 473). The axons of the mitral cells run back in the tract to the anterior perforated substance, through which some of the fibers reach the region of the uncus (at the front of the parahippocampal gyrus, Fig. 7.4) and adjacent parts of the cortex. Other fibers make complex connections with parts of the limbic system. Note that from the olfactory receptors in the nasal mucosa to the cortex, there are two groups of neurons, and that the second neuron has reached the cortex without relay in the thalamus - a unique occurrence.</p>
<p>Further synapses connect the olfactory bulb with the hypothalamus and brainstem, as is the case with other sensory pathways (light, sound, taste, touch) for visceral and somatic effects, distinct from conscious appreciation.</p>
<h2 id="hippocampus">
  Hippocampus
  <a class="anchor" href="#hippocampus">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Just above the anterior part of the parahippocampal gyrus (here known as the subiculum) lies the hippocampal sulcus, which is projected into the floor of the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle as the hippocampus. Viewed from above, the anterior part of it (the pes hippocampi) has the appearance of the knuckles of a clenched fist (Fig. 7.7). On its ventricular surface is a thin film of white matter, the alveus; its cell bodies are in the hippocampus and subiculum. The fibers of the alveus thicken medially to form the fimbria.</p>
<p>This breaks free from the hippocampus as the crus (posterior pillar) of the fornix. The dentate gyrus is a small part of the hippocampus which, as seen from the medial side, lies between the fimbria and the parahippocampal gyrus.</p>
<h2 id="fornix">
  Fornix
  <a class="anchor" href="#fornix">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The fornix is the great efferent pathway from the hippocampus. As a flat band continuous with the fimbria, it curves up behind the thalamus to join its fellow in a partial decussation across the midline, the commissure of the fornix. It is really a chiasma, and is an association tract rather than a true commissure. The conjoined mass of white matter, lying beneath the corpus callosum, is the body of the fornix. From it, the conjoined anterior columns arch down in front of the anterior poles of the thalami, forming the anterior margins of the interventricular foramina (Fig. 7.11).</p>
<p>The columns of the fornix pass both anterior and posterior to the anterior commissure. The anterior fibers pass mainly to the septal nuclei near the lamina terminalis (not in the septum pellucidum). The posterior fibers pass directly to the thalamus or into the mamillary body. From the mamillary body, fibers pass in the lateral wall of the third ventricle as the mamillothalamic tract to the anterior pole of the thalamus. Here they relay, and the thalamic neurons send their fibers through the internal capsule to the cingulate gyrus.</p>
<p>On the upper surface of the corpus callosum is a thin film of grey matter, the induseum griseum, beneath which lie the medial and lateral longitudinal striae. These appear to be aberrant fibers of the fornix.</p>
<h2 id="ventricles-of-the-brain">
  Ventricles of the Brain
  <a class="anchor" href="#ventricles-of-the-brain">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The central nervous system is hollow; it develops from a neural tube whose cavity persists. The cavity is lined throughout with ependyma, a single epithelial-like layer of cells. The brain formation requires cerebrospinal fluid, whatever the reasons may be, and this fluid is produced within the cavity. The places where the cerebrospinal fluid is produced are the ventricles. In each ventricle, the cavity comes to the surface without opening thereon; that is to say, the lining ependyma comes into contact with the surface pia mater, with no grey or white matter between. This is to allow the invagination of a mass of blood capillaries which thus becomes covered by pia and ependyma. This combination of capillaries, pia, and ependyma constitutes the choroid plexus which secretes the cerebrospinal fluid. These vascular fringes invaginate the whole length of each surface encroachment of the ventricle.</p>
<p>Each cerebral hemisphere possesses its cavity, the lateral ventricle, and this comes to the surface at a curved slit, the choroid fissure (p. 597). The choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle is invaginated here. The diencephalon has a cavity, the third ventricle, that comes to the surface on its roof, and here are invaginated the two choroid plexuses of the third ventricle. The pons and medulla share a cavity which reaches the surface at the upper medulla, where the roof is invaginated by the right and left choroid plexuses of the fourth ventricle.</p>
<p>The choroid plexuses of the lateral ventricles are large and highly vascular; this pair secretes the bulk of the cerebrospinal fluid. Each lateral ventricle opens into the third ventricle by the interventricular foramen, and the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle is continuous through this foramen with the very small amount of plexus in the third ventricle. From the third ventricle, the aqueduct opens below into the fourth ventricle, which is a cavity in both pons and medulla. The plexus in the fourth ventricle is separate from that in the third and lateral ventricles and only makes a small contribution to the total amount of cerebrospinal fluid. Below the fourth ventricle, the central canal extends as a tiny tube through the spinal cord into the upper end of the filum terminale. The only apertures in this system lie in the roof of the fourth ventricle, whence the cerebrospinal fluid escapes into the subarachnoid space (p. 613).</p>
<p>Modern methods of imaging, such as CT and MR scanning, have superseded older ventriculography which involved removing some cerebrospinal fluid and replacing it with air to obtain a radiotranslucent outline of the cavities. To interpret whether images of the ventricles are normal or not, it is essential to appreciate that the midline cavities (third ventricle, aqueduct, and fourth ventricle) are symmetrical, but asymmetry, especially posteriorly, is the rule in the lateral ventricles. Look down on the vertex of any skull; it is asymmetrical in that one brow lies anterior to the other and the opposite occipital region lies more posteriorly than its fellow. The cerebral hemispheres are similarly asymmetrical, and their contained lateral ventricles even more so.</p>
<p>The lateral ventricle is a C-shaped cavity, lined with ependyma, lying within the cerebral hemisphere. It does not lie entirely within the white matter of the hemisphere; indeed, on its medial side, it lies against the pia mater of the medial surface of the hemisphere, where pia mater and ependyma come into contact with each other. This line of contact is narrow, and curves around the top of the thalamus and the tail of the caudate nucleus, forming a C-shaped slit on the medial surface of the hemisphere, the choroid fissure (Fig. 7.3). The choroid fissure should be regarded as the medial wall of the body and inferior horn of the ventricle. Into the choroid fissure, the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle passes, invaginating the pia mater and ependyma before it. The lips of the choroid fissure meet around the invaginated plexus, which thus lies hidden within the body and inferior horn of the ventricle.</p>
<p>In other places, the cavity of the lateral ventricle lies further from the surface, so that grey matter at the bottom of a sulcus indents the cavity. Such sulci are the parahippocampal, calcarine, and collateral, which show as convexities within the cavity of the ventricle. The caudate nucleus and thalamus also project into the cavity. Elsewhere, the walls of the cavity are formed by white matter of the cerebral hemisphere.</p>
<p>The C-shaped cavity consists of the body of the ventricle and anterior, posterior, and inferior horns (Figs 7.7 and 7.9). On the upward convexity is the body, projected forwards into a blind extremity, the anterior horn. These parts are floored in by the caudate nucleus and the thalamus, and the roof is the corpus callosum and the fornix.</p>
<p>The anterior horn is bounded by the fibers of the corpus callosum that run laterally from the genu and rostrum (forceps minor). The bulbous head of the caudate nucleus lies in the floor, meeting the roof at an angle on the lateral side (Fig. 7.10), but separated from the roof medially by a thin partition between the fornix and corpus callosum, the septum pellucidum. Behind the anterior column of the fornix, between it and the anterior pole of the thalamus, is a small aperture, the interventricular foramen (of Monro), which leads from the lateral into the third ventricle. The choroid plexus in the body of the ventricle does not extend into the anterior horn but passes through the interventricular foramen (Figs 7.7 and 7.14) into the third ventricle.</p>
<p>The body of the lateral ventricle lies behind the level of the interventricular foramen. Its floor is the thalamus and body of the caudate nucleus, with the thalamostriate groove between them. The stria medullaris lies in the groove; it is a band of white matter running the whole length of the caudate nucleus, from the amygdaloid body at the tail to the anterior perforated substance at the head. Also in the groove (and more important) is the thalamostriate vein (Figs 7.10 and 7.21). The roof of the body is the corpus callosum with, on the medial side, the crus and body of the fornix.</p>
<p>If the corpus callosum is removed in a dissection, the fornix is seen lying upon the thalamus, with the choroid plexus projecting between the two. It appears to be a floor structure of the body of the lateral ventricle. Nonetheless, it is actually a roof structure - a roof can collapse upon a floor, and this has, so to speak, happened to the fornix. Through the medial wall of the body of the ventricle, between roof (fornix) and floor (thalamus), the choroid plexus is invaginated, thrusting pia mater and ependyma before it. This is the upper part of the choroid fissure which is now seen to be limited anteriorly by the interventricular foramen (Figs 7.7 and 7.14).</p>
<p>From the body, the cavity of the lateral ventricle arches downwards and then forwards into the temporal lobe as the inferior horn, and backwards into the occipital lobe as the posterior horn.</p>
<p>The posterior horn is the most variably developed and may even be absent. The floor is a convexity, the collateral eminence, produced by the collateral sulcus. The medial wall consists of two slight convexities: the upper is the bulb of the posterior horn, formed by fibers of the forceps major (from the splenium of the corpus callosum), and the lower is the calcar avis, formed by the calcarine sulcus. It is the calcar which, if well developed, obliterates the posterior horn. The roof and lateral wall are formed by the tapetum of the corpus callosum, with the optic radiation lying against the tapetum in the lateral wall (Fig. 7.7).</p>
<p>The inferior horn is the largest. Its floor consists medially of the hippocampus (p. 589) with, laterally, the collateral eminence, which expands posteriorly into the collateral trigone where the posterior and inferior horns diverge (Fig. 7.7). In the roof is the tail of the caudate nucleus, continuous anteriorly with the amygdaloid body which lies to the lateral side of the anterior perforated substance. The fimbria (p. 589) forms the lower lip of the choroid fissure in the inferior horn just as its continuation the fornix forms the upper lip of the fissure in the body of the lateral ventricle; they lie in continuity around the convexity of the C. Similarly, within the concavity of the C, the caudate nucleus lies in continuity. Its bulbous head in the anterior horn and its thinner body in the floor of the body of the ventricle are continued into the roof of the inferior horn as an ever-diminishing tail of the caudate nucleus. At the extremity of the tail of the caudate nucleus is an expansion of grey matter, the amygdaloid body, which lies to the lateral side of the anterior perforated substance. It produces a shallow convexity on the roof at the tip of the inferior horn.</p>
<p>That part of the brain cranial to the midbrain is the forebrain. Developed as a single tube (the fore-end of the neural tube), its cranial end is formed by a thin plate of grey matter, the lamina terminalis. Just to the caudal side of this lamina, the side walls of the forebrain blow out into two enormous balloons, or vesicles, which become the cerebral hemispheres, already described. The remainder of the forebrain, relatively unexpanded, becomes the diencephalon, still closed anteriorly by the lamina terminalis. The cavity within its substance is the third ventricle, into which the lateral ventricles of the cerebral hemispheres open through the interventricular foramina. The diencephalon, enclosing this cavity, has two side walls, a floor, and a roof. The floor and roof converge towards each other posteriorly, where they join the midbrain; and the cavity of the third ventricle is continued through the midbrain as a narrow canal, the aqueduct (of Sylvius). The aqueduct leads through the midbrain into the cavity of the fourth ventricle (Fig. 7.11).</p>
<p>The anterior wall and floor of the diencephalon can be seen in the undissected brain. The anterior wall is the lamina terminalis, a thin sheet which extends between the two hemispheres from the rostrum of the corpus callosum to the top of the optic chiasma (Fig. 7.11). It contains, in its upper part, the anterior commissure which joins the two piriform areas of the cortex. The floor, seen from below as the floor of the third ventricle, extends from the optic chiasma, tuber cinereum and infundibulum, and mamillary bodies to the posterior perforated substance, where the floor joins the tegmentum of the cerebral peduncles (Fig. 7.4). The anterior wall and floor can be seen cut through in a median sagittal section through the third ventricle; this section exposes the side wall of the diencephalon (Fig. 7.11).</p>
<p>In such a section, a thin partition, the septum pellucidum, is seen connecting the rostrum, genu, and front of the body of the corpus callosum on the one hand to the anterior column of the fornix on the other. This is a part of the medial surface of the hemisphere cut off by the backward growth of the corpus callosum; its function is unknown. The septum consists of two layers that may be adherent; when they lie apart, the closed space between them is the cavity of the septum pellucidum; it has no connection with the ventricular system, and the term &ldquo;fifth ventricle&rdquo; sometimes applied to it should therefore be avoided. The cavity is lined with pia mater, not ependyma.</p>
<p>The third ventricle (Fig. 7.11) is a slit-like space, lying in the sagittal plane. Much of the lateral wall is occupied by the thalamus, a rounded mass of grey matter that bulges convexly into the ventricle. The two thalami often (60% of brains) become gummed together at the interthalamic adhesion. It is not a commissure, and there is no interchange of fibers between the two sides. The adhesion, when present, gives a fenestrated shadow in images of the third ventricle. The hypothalamic groove curves down from the interventricular foramen below the thalamus towards the aqueduct of the midbrain. A sagittal image shows the lateral bulge produced by the groove.</p>
<p>Below the hypothalamic groove, the side wall slopes down to the floor. This region, including the floor, is the hypothalamus (Figs 7.11 and 7.12). The caudal part of this area that merges with the midbrain is the subthalamus, one of whose principal features is the subthalamic nucleus. In coronal sections through the internal capsule and brainstem (Fig. 7.10), this nucleus is seen easily as a small lens-shaped body on the medial side of the capsule, lying adjacent to the substantia nigra. It belongs functionally to the basal nuclei (p. 581).</p>
<p>The hypothalamus contains various cell groups, in particular the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei whose axons run in the pituitary stalk into the posterior lobe of the pituitary (p. 569), and other cells whose processes enter the pituitary stalk to deliver their neurosecretory material to the hypophyseal portal system of blood vessels for the control of the anterior lobe. Yet other cells have long axons that pass by the spinal sympathetic tract to preganglionic cells in the lateral grey columns of the thoracic and upper lumbar parts of the spinal cord (p. 30).</p>
<p>Behind the optic chiasma, the (hollow) infundibulum projects downwards to become the (solid) pituitary stalk. Behind the infundibulum, the upper surface of the floor slopes smoothly upwards and backwards to the aqueduct, but the external surface is marked by the pair of mamillary bodies and behind them by the posterior perforated substance. The part of the floor between the infundibulum and the mamillary bodies is the tuber cinereum, and the part of the tuber cinereum at the base of the infundibulum is the median eminence - highly important as the site of the neurosecretory cells that control the anterior pituitary, and one of the few regions with no blood-brain barrier (p. 600). The dependent mamillary bodies and the posterior perforated substance make no mark inside the ventricle. From the indentation of the optic chiasma, the anterior wall (lamina terminalis) passes up. The tiny angle between the lamina terminalis and the chiasma is the supraoptic recess, and the hollow in the infundibulum is the infundibular recess. Attached behind the upper end of the lamina terminalis is the anterior commissure, a rounded cord that joins the two piriform areas of cortex. It is a commissure of the archaeopallium (p. 599). Behind this, the conjoined anterior columns of the fornix lie in contact before they diverge to sink down into the lateral wall of the ventricle. Behind each anterior column is an interventricular foramen, ependyma-lined and roofed in by bare pia mater sweeping from the undersurface of the body of the fornix to the upper surface of the anterior pole of the thalamus. This is the anterior limit of the tela choroidea (Figs 7.11 and 7.14), the name given to a double fold of pia mater.</p>
<p>The tela choroidea is a double fold of pia mater, the lower layer of which covers the upper surface of the thalamus and forms the roof of the third ventricle. The upper layer of the tela choroidea covers the undersurface of the fornix and the splenium of the corpus callosum. The two layers are reflected on each other at the interventricular foramina and at the lateral extent of the tela. The choroid plexuses of the third ventricle, which hang down as slender fringes inside the cavity, are invaginated into the roof of the third ventricle.</p>
<p>The pial roof (Figs 7.11 and 7.12) extends forward to the anterior pole of the thalamus, sweeps across to the anterior column of the fornix to close the interventricular foramen, thence no longer lined with ependyma it passes back on the undersurface of the fornix as the upper layer of the tela choroidea, out of contact with the third ventricle (Figs 7.11 and 7.14).</p>
<p>Attached to the habenular commissure, the pineal body projects back, lying above the superior colliculi between the posterior parts of the thalami, just below the splenium (Figs 7.11 and 7.24). It is a soft conical body, less than half a centimeter long, and is one of the few regions with no blood-brain barrier (p. 600). It is noteworthy for the number of corpora amylacea it contains. These calcify, and to such an extent that after the age of forty years, they normally throw a shadow in radiographs of the skull. Such calcified particles (known to the ancients) were called brain sand; they occur also in the choroid plexuses. A displaced calcified pineal indicates a space-occupying lesion above the tentorium. The pineal cells secrete melatonin (a hormone related to serotonin), which in animals and probably in man also has an antigonadotrophic action.</p>
<p>The posterior wall of the third ventricle is formed by the habenular commissure, which connects the two habenular nuclei, and the posterior commissure, which connects the two superior colliculi above the entrance to the aqueduct. Between the habenular and posterior commissures, the pineal stalk is hollowed out as the pineal recess (Fig. 7.12), not to be confused with the larger suprapineal recess between the pineal body and the habenular commissure.</p>
<p>The thalamus is seen in horizontal and coronal sections buried in the cerebral hemisphere (Figs 7.7 and 7.10), and by its connections with the sensory parts of the internal capsule, it appears to be part of the hemisphere. This is not so; it is part of the wall of the diencephalon, the part of the forebrain which does not expand into the cerebral hemispheres. However, as the cerebral hemispheres develop, new cells in the thalamus send fibers up to the sensory cortex, and in this way, the neothalamus becomes incorporated in the pathways leading to the cortex. The neothalamus lies on the lateral side.</p>
<p>The mass of grey matter making up the thalamus is roughly wedge-shaped. The medial walls of the two thalami lie parallel, near each other across the third ventricle, where in two-thirds of cases, they are joined by the interthalamic adhesion. This part of the medial surface is covered with the ependyma of the third ventricle. Behind this, the medial surface diverges from the midline and expands into a large posterior convexity, the pulvinar.</p>
<p>The superior surface of the thalamus is convex and triangular in outline, tapering forward from the large pulvinar to the small blunt anterior pole (Fig. 7.14). The superior surface and the posterior surface (pulvinar) of the thalamus are on the external surface of the diencephalon itself. They are covered in pia mater. An oblique strip along the lateral margin of the superior surface lies in the lateral ventricle. Covered with ependyma, this narrow strip belongs rather to the hemisphere than to the diencephalon. The body and tail of the caudate nucleus are in contact here with the lateral margin of the thalamus (Fig. 7.6).</p>
<p>The lateral surface of the thalamus is bevelled by the internal capsule (Fig. 7.10), whose descending fibers lie in contact. The ascending fibers of the internal capsule arise further back from numerous nuclei in this lateral part (neothalamus) and make the neothalamus all one, as it were, with the hemisphere.</p>
<p>The inferior surface of the thalamus is narrower than the superior surface. Medially, it joins the hypothalamus down to the posterior perforated substance in the floor of the third ventricle. Here pass various striate arteries and thalamic veins. Lateral to this, and posterior too, the lemnisci of the tegmentum (p. 606) enter the thalamus and attach it to the top of the midbrain.</p>
<p>Structurally, the thalamus consists of a large number of cell groups, the thalamic nuclei. In simplified terms, there are lateral, medial, anterior, and other nuclei, with numerous subdivisions. Among the most important is the ventroposterior part of the lateral nucleus, which receives inputs from the medial and spinal lemnisci and the reticular formation and projects to sensory areas of the cerebral cortex, thus making the thalamus a great cell station on sensory pathways. Other parts of the lateral nucleus receive fibers from the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum and the globus pallidus and project to the motor areas of the cortex, so contributing to motor control. Some medial cell groups receive fibers from the hypothalamus and corpus striatum and have reciprocal connections with the frontal lobes; they appear to be concerned with emotional responses and memory. The hypothalamus also sends fibers to the anterior thalamic nucleus via the mamillothalamic tract, and the nucleus projects to the cingulate gyrus; it is part of the limbic system (p. 588). Other thalamic nuclei have connections with the reticular formation (p. 611). The medial and lateral geniculate bodies are specialized parts of the thalamus concerned with hearing and vision respectively (see above and p. 587).</p>
<p>The pia mater over the thalamus originally invested the cylindrical tube of the diencephalon, as, for example, it still invests the mesencephalon or the spinal cord in the adult. Over the dorsal surface of the diencephalon, however, the corpus callosum and fornix extend back. Each of these is clothed in pia mater. Thus, the pia mater is folded back on itself from the interventricular foramina (Fig. 7.14). Behind this, it extends over the roof and dorsal surface of the thalamus and continues down over the pineal body and tectum of the midbrain. From the interventricular foramina, it likewise extends backwards on the undersurface of fornix and corpus callosum and is reflected around the splenium of the latter to the upper surface of the body of the corpus callosum. Upper and lower layers of pia mater, thus lying in contact, are no more than the pia mater investing the surface of any part of the central nervous system; they are only lying in contact because the fornix and corpus callosum project back over the dorsal surface of the diencephalon. These two layers of pia mater are the tela choroidea. They are reflected, the upper onto the lower, between the interventricular foramina and are similarly reflected onto each other at the lateral extent of the tela. This follows the line of the body of the fornix, which passes obliquely across the upper surface of the thalamus.</p>
<p>The choroid fissure is a C-shaped slit in the medial wall of the cerebral hemisphere, extending from the interventricular foramen around the thalamus and cerebral peduncle as far as the uncus of the temporal lobe (Fig. 7.3A). Its convexity is contained by the body and crus (pillar) of the fornix, the fimbria, and the hippocampus; its concavity is contained by the thalamus (upper and posterior surfaces) and the tail of the caudate nucleus. At the slit, pia mater and ependyma come into contact with each other, and both are invaginated into the lateral ventricle as the choroid plexus. The choroid fissure on the medial wall of the hemisphere was originally on the roof of the cerebral vesicle, and the arrangement is better understood by considering the development.</p>
<h2 id="development-of-the-forebrain">
  Development of the Forebrain
  <a class="anchor" href="#development-of-the-forebrain">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The whole neural tube (p. 35) is hollow (as in any tube), and the cavity comes to the surface in two places, each on the dorsal surface of the tube. In these two places, the ependyma lining the cavity of the tube lies in contact with the pia mater clothing the surface of the tube. The anterior of these two areas is destined to become the forebrain, the posterior the hindbrain (fourth ventricle).</p>
<p>The forebrain is limited by the lamina terminalis, which remains in situ in the adult. Across its dorsal margin lies a commissure connecting the two sides; this is the anterior commissure and persists as such. The roof, as already stated, is devoid of nervous tissue; here pia mater and ependyma blend. The side wall contains nerve cells that form the primitive thalamus.</p>
<p>From near the front end of the hollow forebrain, right and left hollow diverticula grow out laterally, like bubbles. The thalamus lies behind (caudal to) these cerebral vesicles (Fig. 7.15), and this part of the forebrain remains relatively stable as the diencephalon. The cavities of diencephalon and cerebral vesicles communicate at the site of the future interventricular foramen, in the side wall of the diencephalon.</p>
<p>As the cerebral vesicle grows out, it takes the thin roof of the forebrain with it. Into the L-shaped roof thus produced, a mass of blood capillaries, itself L-shaped, is invaginated to form a choroid plexus. The plexus is fed by an artery at its lateral extremity (the anterior choroidal artery) and it drains by a choroidal vein which runs back along the roof of the unexpanded diencephalon, to join with the vein of the opposite side.</p>
<p>The cerebral vesicles grow mightily and become rotated, with their surfaces folded to accommodate themselves to the limits of the cranial cavity in which they develop. The thin roof-plate of the vesicle, with its invaginated choroid plexus, becomes compressed and distorted. The cerebral vesicles grow by multiplication of nerve cells in the grey matter on their surfaces. As new daughter cells appear, their axons grow in two main ways: to produce commissural and association fibers, and to produce projection fibers. Both sets of fibers produce new complications. The commissural fibers form the corpus callosum, and association fibers form the fornix. The former grows first forwards (the rostrum) then backwards (the genu, body, and splenium) in conformity with the growth of the vesicles (cerebral hemispheres). The fornix is forced backwards by the backward growth of the corpus callosum, so that both come to overlie the roof of the unexpanded forebrain (diencephalon). The cerebral vesicles (cerebral hemispheres) grow caudally, then ventrally, and finally forward. The corpus callosum could only do this by cutting through the brainstem; hence its fibers, sweeping away to the temporal lobe, become heaped up into a thick mass posteriorly, forming the splenium. The fornix, on the other hand, consists of association rather than commissural fibers, and it parts from its fellow and sweeps around the side of the diencephalon to pass forwards into the temporal pole.</p>
<p>In addition to these commissural and association fibers, projection fibers pass down from the cortex of the developing cerebral vesicle into lower centers in the developing neural tube. These corticospinal fibers stream down alongside the thalamus. Meanwhile, ascending tracts are developing and extend up to new cells developing in the lateral wall of the thalamus. From these thalamic cells, new fibers pass up to the cortex, establishing continuity between the lateral part of the thalamus and the cortex of the cerebral vesicle. The two.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, cells have been dividing in the floor of the cerebral vesicle to produce the corpus striatum. Fibers of the internal capsule interrupt the continuity of this cell mass and almost completely separate the caudate from the lentiform nucleus. The fibers bulge the caudate nucleus (and lateral ventricle, in the floor of which it lies) convexly around their mass.</p>
<p>At the same time, the cerebral vesicle itself has been altering its position. Unequal growth on its surface forces the roof to the medial surface, and the curvature of the caudate nucleus and lateral ventricle around the fibers of the internal capsule is reflected in a similar curvature of the thin roof plate around the thalamus and internal capsule. Thus, the original dorsal roof plate of the vesicle (choroid fissure) becomes medial and curved; but the anterior choroidal artery still enters the distal extremity of the fissure, and the choroid plexus of the cerebral vesicle is still in continuity with the choroid plexus of the diencephalon (third ventricle) at the point of junction of the original roof plates (interventricular foramen) (Figs 7.13 and 7.15).</p>
<p>Certain parts of the cortex, notably the insula and piriform area, can be regarded as remnants of the primitive brain (archaeopallium). Anterior and posterior commissures unite the two halves. The anterior pole of the thalamus and the globus pallidus provide the subcortical nuclei. The archaeopallium was predominantly a smell brain. The contemporary cerebellum (p. 617) was mainly vestibular in its connections (archaeocerebellum).</p>
<p>The huge growth of hemisphere which buries the insula is the neopallium. Its commissure is the corpus callosum, and it is associated with the appearance of the putamen and caudate nucleus and the lateral nuclei of the thalamus. With the neopallium appear also the neocerebellum and the red and olivary nuclei.</p>
<p>The smell world has been replaced by a new sight, hearing, and touch world, and fine coordinated movements have become possible.</p>
<p>The cerebral hemispheres and the walls of the diencephalon are supplied from both the internal carotid and vertebral systems. The arteries are directed in essence to the grey matter, which needs more blood than the white matter. Superficial cortical arteries supply the grey matter on the surface, perforating arteries supply the subcortical nuclei. Both sets of arteries send branches to the adjacent white matter.</p>
<p>An artery that has entered the surface of the brain from either of these sets is always an end artery (i.e., it has no precapillary anastomosis with its fellows), and thus cerebral softening follows its obstruction. Entering arteries invaginate a tubular prolongation of pia mater around them, forming a perivascular space that extends to the fine branches of the vessel.</p>
<p>The internal carotid and vertebral systems anastomose with each other around the optic chiasma and infundibulum of the pituitary stalk, forming the arterial circle of Willis (the French call it, more accurately, the polygon of Willis). The communicating vessels allow equalization of blood flow between the two sides of the brain, and can allow anastomotic circulation if parts are occluded; however, this is not always effective due to the small size of some vessels. The circle is formed in the following way. The basilar artery from the vertebral system divides at the upper border of the pons into right and left posterior cerebral arteries. From each posterior cerebral, a small posterior communicating artery runs forward through the interpeduncular cistern to join the internal carotid artery at the anterior perforated substance. Each internal carotid artery gives off an anterior cerebral artery; the circle of Willis is completed by the anterior communicating artery, a small vessel that unites the anterior cerebrals in the chiasmatic cistern, below the rostrum of the corpus callosum. The only structures encircled by the circle of Willis are the optic chiasma and the pituitary stalk (Fig. 7.23). Rupture of an aneurysm of the arterial circle accounts for 90% of subarachnoid hemorrhages. Congenital aneurysms are more commonly found on the carotid part of the circle than the basilar part, and are most frequent at sites where vessels branch (e.g., anterior cerebral with anterior communicating, internal carotid with posterior communicating or middle cerebral) because here the tunica media is weakest.</p>
<h2 id="blood-supply-of-the-cerebral-hemispheres">
  Blood Supply of the Cerebral Hemispheres
  <a class="anchor" href="#blood-supply-of-the-cerebral-hemispheres">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The arterial supply of the cerebrum is by three cerebral arteries, anterior, middle, and posterior, as might be expected from the name cerebral, but there is also a contribution from a fourth artery, the anterior choroidal (although, unlike the other three, it does not supply the cerebral cortex). The former two are branches of the internal carotid, the posterior cerebral is the terminal branch of the basilar (from the two vertebrals), and the anterior choroidal arises from the termination of the internal carotid or its near neighbors, the middle cerebral or posterior communicating. The branches of the three cerebral arteries anastomose across the frontiers of their respective territories (Figs 7.17 and 7.18), on the surface of the pia mater, but sparsely and only by arterioles. Their perforating branches are invariably end arteries. The larger surface vessels have a sympathetic innervation, but after becoming intracortical, they are not innervated.</p>
<p>Capillaries in the brain (and spinal cord) are characterized by lack of fenestrations and by abundant tight junctions (zonulae occludentes) between endothelial cells. This is the principal structural reason for the blood-brain barrier which operates to protect the internal environment of neural tissue by allowing only selected substances (amino acids, amines, and sugars) to be transported across the endothelial cells. This protective mechanism is possibly assisted by a basal lamina that is thicker than usual and by the enveloping foot processes of astrocytes. Among the more important parts of the brain that have no blood-brain barrier are the posterior pituitary (p. 570), pineal body (p. 595), median eminence of the hypothalamus (p. 594), and the area postrema of the fourth ventricle (p. 611).</p>
<p>The internal carotid artery emerges from the roof of the cavernous sinus, gives off the ophthalmic artery, then curls back to lie on the front half of the roof. It then turns vertically upwards to the anterior perforated substance where it divides into middle and anterior cerebral branches for the supply of the cortex. It here gives off also the striate arteries, the anterior choroidal artery, and the posterior communicating artery (Fig. 7.23).</p>
<p>The middle cerebral artery is the largest and most direct branch of the internal carotid (Fig. 7.23) and therefore most subject to embolism. It passes deep into the lateral sulcus to supply the cortex of the insula and overlying opercula. It reaches the lateral surface of the hemisphere by passing in the lateral sulcus, from which its branches emerge for the most part deep in the sulci and ramify over an area that falls short of the borders of the lateral surface by one gyrus or its equivalent breadth (Fig. 7.17). It does not reach the superior frontal gyrus or the inferior temporal gyrus. In its area of cortical distribution lie the motor and sensory areas for the opposite half of the body excluding leg and perineum (which are in anterior cerebral territory - see below) and the auditory and speech areas. For striate arteries, see below.</p>
<p>The anterior cerebral artery leaves the internal carotid artery at the anterior perforated substance and passes forwards above the optic nerve (Fig. 7.23). It is connected to its fellow of the opposite side by the anterior communicating artery. It is distributed to the orbital surface of the frontal lobe and to the whole of the medial surface of the hemisphere above the corpus callosum as far back as the parieto-occipital sulcus. Its distribution extends over the superior border to meet the area supplied by the middle cerebral artery; it thus supplies the superior frontal gyrus and an equal zone behind this over the parietal lobe. The motor and sensory areas for the opposite leg and perineum, including the micturition and defecation centers, lie in its territory (Figs 7.17 and 7.18). Because of the anastomosis via the anterior communicating artery, it is usually possible for one anterior cerebral to be supplied with blood from the contralateral internal carotid (although occasionally).</p>
<p>The fact that the internal carotid gives origin to the anterior and middle cerebral arteries (supplying the sensorimotor cortex and internal capsule - see below) and to the ophthalmic artery (supplying the retina - p. 514) accounts for the characteristic combination of blindness in one eye with contralateral hemiplegia that may follow stenosis or occlusion of the internal carotid artery. However, occlusion may be silent because of collateral circulation through the arterial circle; the effects are very variable, depending on the state and size of the vessels.</p>
<p>The posterior cerebral artery curls back around the cerebral peduncle (supplying it and the optic tract) (Fig. 7.23), and passes back above the tentorium to supply the inferomedial surface of the temporal and occipital lobes (Figs 7.17 and 7.18). Its territory meets that of the anterior cerebral artery at the parieto-occipital sulcus. Its branches extend around the borders of the brain to supply the inferior temporal gyrus and a corresponding strip of cortex on the lateral surface of the occipital lobe. The visual area for the opposite field of vision lies wholly within its territory, but it should be noted that the middle cerebral branches can sometimes extend sufficiently far back on the occipital lobe to supply the macular part of the visual area (p. 640). Thus, the macular field of vision may be spared when the rest of the visual area is destroyed by a posterior cerebral thrombosis. The posterior cerebral may receive some or all of its blood from the internal carotid and not the basilar; indeed, this is the primitive embryonic condition where the posterior cerebral is a branch of the carotid. The basilar system is a later development which joins the original posterior cerebral, whose proximal end usually becomes the posterior communicating. A definitive posterior cerebral arising from the internal carotid is simply a persistence of the embryonic pattern. The arterial supply of the subcortical nuclei is by branches from the three cerebral vessels, as might be expected, but there is a fourth which is perhaps unexpected - the anterior choroidal. Branches from the cerebral vessels enter through the perforated substances.</p>
<p>The anterior perforated substance receives numerous small branches from the anterior and middle cerebral arteries. These are the striate branches (long central branches) and are of supreme importance because they supply the internal capsule, as well as the thalamus and basal nuclei. Clinicians give them various names such as perforating, lenticulostriate, thalamostriate, and thalamolenticular, but anatomically they are divided into medial and lateral groups. The medial striate branches arise from both the anterior and middle cerebral vessels, and their area of supply includes the genu and posterior limb of the internal capsule. One of the larger branches from the anterior cerebral is the recurrent artery (of Heubner), which supplies the more posterior part of the capsule, including the leg area (but the branch is absent in 3%). The lateral striate branches arise from the middle cerebral and anterior choroidal vessels; one of them from the middle cerebral is the artery of cerebral hemorrhage whose rupture or occlusion are the commonest causes of a typical stroke with contralateral hemiplegia.</p>
<p>Branches from the posterior cerebral artery enter the posterior perforated substance to reach the thalamus and the caudate nucleus, penetrating the posterior part of the internal capsule on the way.</p>
<p>The anterior choroidal artery supplies the choroid plexus, passing below the optic tract to enter the inferior extremity of the choroid fissure at the tip of the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle, just above the uncus. The artery gives branches to the optic chiasma and tract and the lateral geniculate body, and the posterior part of the internal capsule. The plexus receives from the posterior cerebral artery a few additional twigs which enter the choroid fissure behind the thalamus.</p>
<p><strong>Effects of arterial occlusion.</strong> Obviously, the effect of occlusion of the cerebral arteries will vary with the degree and site of obstruction, but the main effects of complete occlusion may be summarized as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anterior cerebral:</strong> complete contralateral hemiplegia and hemianesthesia (leg, arm, and face), but if distal to Heubner&rsquo;s artery, only the opposite leg is affected.</li>
<li><strong>Middle cerebral:</strong> complete contralateral hemiplegia and hemianesthesia (with aphasia if the lesion is left-sided) and cerebral edema (which may cause hemianopia from compression of the optic radiation).</li>
</ul>
<p>The venous return does not follow the arterial pattern. Unlike the cortical arteries, which tend to travel deep in the sulci, the cortical veins tend to travel superficially, in the arachnoid mater (Fig. 7.19). They lie adherent to the deep surface of the arachnoid mater that bridges each sulcus. This helps to keep them open. In general, blood flows into the nearest available venous sinus of the dura mater, generally entering obliquely against the bloodstream. Only where there is no sinus near enough (anterior part of the hemisphere and lower parts of basal nuclei) is a venous pattern formed that resembles the arterial pattern.</p>
<p>The superolateral surface of the hemisphere drains into the superior sagittal sinus (Fig. 7.20) by superior cerebral veins above and into the transverse sinus below, in each case by veins that enter against the direction of blood flow. The superior veins, if encountering a blood lake, pass on its cerebral surface beneath the arachnoid (the blood lakes are between the two layers of the dura, Fig. 7.16).</p>
<p>Adherent to the deep surface of the arachnoid mater that bridges the lateral sulcus runs the superficial middle cerebral vein, draining the adjacent cortex and emptying into the cavernous sinus. At the posterior end of this vein are superior and inferior anastomotic veins which join the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses. The depths of the lateral sulcus and the surface of the insula are too far from a sinus in the dura mater. Blood from this region drains into the deep middle cerebral vein which joins the basal vein (see below).</p>
<p>The medial and inferior surfaces of the hemisphere drain by inferior cerebral veins into the geometrically nearest venous sinus of the dura mater (the two sagittals and the straight sinus) except anteriorly, where there is no sinus present in the margins of the falx. Here, the blood from the surface of the hemisphere is collected into the anterior cerebral vein, which returns around the genu of the corpus callosum alongside the anterior cerebral artery to join the basal vein (see below). The anterior cerebral vein drains also the orbital surface of the frontal lobe. It is the only large vein of the brain to have a similar name and course to its companion artery.</p>
<p>At the anterior perforated substance, striate veins emerge through the perforations. They drain the lower part of the corpus striatum and join the deep middle cerebral vein and the anterior cerebral vein; the veins from these three sources form the basal vein (Figs 7.20 and 7.21). This passes around the cerebral peduncle below the optic tract and the anterior choroidal artery, with the fourth nerve and the posterior cerebral artery. It receives veins from the posterior perforated substance; these drain the lower part of the thalamus.</p>
<p>Just below the splenium, the two basal veins join the great cerebral vein (see below). Only the lower parts of the basal ganglia drain through the perforated substances into the basal vein; their upper parts drain into the internal cerebral vein.</p>
<p>The internal cerebral vein (Fig. 7.21) receives blood from three sources. It is formed at the interventricular foramen by the meeting of the choroidal vein, draining the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle, and the thalamostriate vein which lies in the groove between the thalamus and caudate nucleus and receives blood from both. The veins of the septum pellucidum which bring blood from the corpus callosum and adjacent cortex and the head of the caudate nucleus (Fig. 7.21) usually join the thalamostriate vein.</p>
<p>The internal cerebral vein receives the veins from the tiny choroid plexus of the third ventricle and then joins its fellow to make the great cerebral vein (of Galen) just beneath the splenium. This vein is joined by the two basal veins, and with the inferior sagittal sinus, it enters the straight sinus.</p>

  Cerebral Structure
  <a class="anchor" href="#cerebral-structure">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The cerebral cortex is composed of layers of cells which vary in their characteristics in different regions. In general, motor cortex has many large pyramidal cells, sensory cortex has smaller round granular cells. All are intermixed with neuroglial cells and their processes and with blood capillaries.</p>
<p>In most parts of the cortex, six layers of nerve cells can be distinguished, and are conventionally numbered from the surface inwards by Roman numerals. Layer I has an abundance of fibers with relatively few cells, the plexiform layer. Then follow the external granular (II), pyramidal (III), internal granular (IV), ganglionic (V), and multiform (VI) layers, roughly named from the density and shapes of their cells. In layers IV and V, there are often prominent strands of horizontal fibers, the external and internal bands of Baillarger; in the visual cortex, the external band is the stria of Gennari (p. 587).</p>
<p>Changes in the relative distribution of these layers are most pronounced in the known sensory and motor areas. The postcentral gyrus (touch), the superior temporal gyrus (hearing), and the calcarine sulcus (sight) are covered by cortex in which granular cells predominate, while motor areas typically have larger numbers of pyramidal cells. Among the cells of layer V of the precentral gyrus are the giant pyramidal cells (of Betz), which resemble large anterior horn cells of the spinal cord; they give rise to no more than 2% of corticospinal fibers.</p>
<p>The white matter is composed of myelinated nerve fibers bound together by the fibers of the neuroglia. Myelin within the central nervous system is derived from the oligodendrocytes (in contrast to the peripheral nervous system where it comes from Schwann cells). The various subcortical masses of grey matter will obviously contain neuronal cell bodies, with different characteristics in each site, but details are reserved for the neurohistological specialist.</p>
<p>The brainstem is the part of the brain connecting the cerebrum and diencephalon with the spinal cord, and consists of the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata (Figs 7.3B, 7.6, and 7.22-7.24). It extends from just above the aperture in the tentorium cerebelli to C1 vertebra below the foramen magnum, and the cerebellum projects from its dorsal surface. The medulla oblongata passes through the foramen magnum, and the change of name to spinal cord occurs where the uppermost rootlets of C1 nerve emerge. Do not confuse the medulla oblongata with the spinal medulla, which is the proper name for the spinal cord.</p>
<p>The brainstem consists of fibers and cells. Most of the fibers in the brainstem ascend or descend longitudinally, as in the spinal cord, and most of the cells are aggregated into nuclei (collections of cell bodies). These nuclei consist of three groups:</p>
<ol>
<li>The nuclei of the third to the twelfth cranial nerves.</li>
<li>Other named nuclei which are demonstrable, such as the colliculi, the red nucleus, the substantia nigra, the pontine nuclei, and the olivary nucleus.</li>
<li>The reticular formation, a diffuse system of cells and fibers which is intermingled with the named nuclei and tracts, continues into the spinal cord, and is described further on page 611. Some of its cells form the so-called vital centers - cardiac, respiratory, vasomotor, etc. - which are not anatomically demonstrable as distinct nuclei, but are of great physiological importance. Significant interruption of their function leads to brain death (p. 616).</li>
</ol>
<p>To understand the positions of the main cell groups and tracts, a minimum of seven sections at different levels is required: two through the midbrain (upper and lower), two through the pons (upper and lower), and three through the medulla (one through the upper and two through the lower parts). They are illustrated in that order in Figures 7.25 to 7.31 which should be referred to frequently when reading this section. The general shapes of the sections and the gross features visible to the naked eye (even without staining) should make each level instantly recognizable, as explained below; stains must be used for more precise definition of cell and fiber groups.</p>
<p>The positions of the main cell groups (nuclei) will be described with the internal structure of each of the three parts of the brainstem; thereafter, the longitudinal tracts will be considered in the brainstem as a whole, since in this way it is easier to appreciate their continuity and changes in position as they course upwards or downwards.</p>
<h2 id="midbrain">
  Midbrain
  <a class="anchor" href="#midbrain">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The midbrain connects the diencephalon and cerebrum to the pons (Figs 7.4 and 7.22). In relation to the skull, it extends from a level just above the dorsum sellae of the sphenoid to a line that joins the apices of the petrous parts of the temporal bones, i.e., most of it lies in the posterior cranial fossa, with its upper part passing through the tentorial notch, and the front part of the cerebellum lying behind. The pineal body, with the splenium of the corpus callosum above it, overlies the superior colliculi on the dorsal surface of the midbrain. Above and behind this lies the inferior surface of the cerebral hemisphere.</p>
<p>The midbrain consists of right and left halves, each half forming a cerebral peduncle made up of a ventral part, the base (basis pedunculi), and a dorsal part, the tegmentum. Running through the tegmentum is the aqueduct of the midbrain (aqueduct of Sylvius), joining the third and fourth ventricles. The part of the tegmentum dorsal to the aqueduct is the tectum.</p>
<p>On the ventral surface are seen the bases of the peduncles (often called the crura), which lie in V-shaped manner cranial to the pons, enclosing the posterior perforated substance of the diencephalon between them (Fig. 7.22). They converge as rope-like bands down towards the upper border of the pons from their point of emergence below the thalamus.</p>
<p>Dorsally, the midbrain is roughly cylindrical. It shows two pairs of low rounded eminences, the superior and inferior colliculi (formerly called corpora quadrigemina, Fig. 7.24). The superior colliculi lie below the pineal body, behind the posterior ends of the thalami and the roof of the third ventricle, and are overlapped somewhat by the splenium of the corpus callosum. Lateral to each superior colliculus is the medial geniculate body which, although appearing to belong to the brainstem, is part of the thalamus (p. 596). Below the inferior colliculi, the superior cerebellar peduncles converge into the dorsal surface of the midbrain from the cerebellum.</p>
<p>The third and fourth cranial nerves leave the brainstem at the midbrain, but the sites of their emergence are very different (Figs 7.22 and 7.23). The oculomotor nerve leaves through the medial surface of the crus, on the ventral surface of the midbrain, and passes forwards between the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries in the interpeduncular cistern to reach the roof of the cavernous sinus. The trochlear nerve leaves the dorsal surface of the midbrain just behind the inferior colliculus. This nerve is unique in three respects: it is the smallest cranial nerve, the only one to emerge from the dorsal surface of the brainstem, and the only one to decussate within the brainstem. The nerve curls round the lateral side of the peduncle and passes forwards between the same two arteries as the third nerve (posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar) but farther laterally, to run just below the free edge of the tentorium and enter the cavernous sinus where the free and attached margins of the tentorium cross (p. 567).</p>
<p>The optic tract also curls round the peduncle; ventral to the tract are the basal vein on its way from the anterior perforated substance to the great cerebral vein (p. 603) and the posterior communicating artery joining the posterior cerebral and internal carotid arteries (Fig. 7.23).</p>
<h3 id="internal-structure-1">
  Internal Structure
  <a class="anchor" href="#internal-structure-1">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Sections of the midbrain are recognized by the colliculi of the tectum on the dorsal surface, the aqueduct, and the rectangular crura on the ventral surface, delimited by a dark line of pigmented cells, the substantia nigra. Other naked-eye features at superior colliculus level are the red nucleus with fibers of the third nerve probably seen sweeping through it, while at inferior colliculus level is the centrally-placed decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncles.</p>
<p>The colliculi of the tectum contain reflex centers for light and sound, and the grey matter round the aqueduct contains the nuclei of the third and fourth nerves and the mesencephalic nucleus of the fifth nerve. The tegmentum contains the red nucleus.</p>
<p>Although in the midbrain at the junction of the tegmentum and crus, the substantia nigra belongs functionally to the basal nuclei (p. 581). Many of its cells contain melanin, responsible for its naked-eye dark appearance. Some of its cells give rise to nigrostriatal fibers which are dopaminergic and project back to the caudate nucleus and putamen. The loss of about 80% of its dopaminergic cells is the fundamental defect in parkinsonism.</p>
<p>The superior colliculus contains cells involved in general light reflexes, while the inferior colliculus is concerned with sound reflexes. They receive inputs from the retina and cochlea respectively and project to the motor nuclei of cranial and spinal nerves (via tectobulbar and tectospinal tracts) for reflex movements of the eyes, head, body, and limbs away from or towards light and sound stimuli. The above general light reflexes must not be confused with the pupillary light reflexes (p. 518) involving the pretectal nuclei, which lie just cranial to the superior colliculi at the junction of the midbrain and diencephalon (Fig. 7.38).</p>
<p>The oculomotor nucleus lies close against the midline ventral to the aqueduct (Fig. 7.25), in line with the other somatic motor nuclei (fourth, sixth, and twelfth). The parasympathetic part (Edinger-Westphal or accessory oculomotor nucleus) lies near the midline in the cranial part of the nucleus; its axons run out with the third nerve and relay in the ciliary ganglion, from which postganglionic fibers innervate the sphincter pupillae and ciliary muscles (p. 518). The third nerve passes ventrally through the red nucleus to emerge from the brainstem on the medial side of the base of the peduncle.</p>
<p>The trochlear nucleus lies caudal to the oculomotor nucleus, ventral to the aqueduct at inferior colliculus level (Fig. 7.26). The nerve proceeds dorsally and crosses the midline, where it decussates with its fellow dorsal to the aqueduct. It emerges through the superior medullary velum behind the inferior colliculus (Fig. 7.24).</p>
<p>The red nucleus lies in the tegmentum just ventral to the third nerve nucleus, the axons of which pass through it (Fig. 7.25). It is easily made out in sections of the midbrain, being slightly larger than a full-sized pea. It receives fibers coming from the dentate nucleus in the opposite cerebellar hemisphere via the superior cerebellar peduncle. It has many other connections, especially with the cortex and globus pallidus. Its efferent fibers decussate at the level of the inferior colliculi and descend to the pontine nuclei and spinal cord. The rubrospinal tract is part of the extrapyramidal system (p. 623). Despite its size, the red nucleus seems to be of little functional significance in man, and it is not associated with any known disease.</p>
<p>The medial geniculate body, which is applied to the dorsal surface of the midbrain at the level of the superior colliculus (Fig. 7.25), belongs to the thalamus and has been described on page 596.</p>
<p>The mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve lies in the central grey matter, lateral to the aqueduct, throughout the whole length of the midbrain. This long slender nucleus receives proprioceptive fibers from the muscles supplied by the mandibular branch of the trigeminal (muscles of mastication) and from the muscles of the orbit and face and, perhaps, the muscles of the tongue (see p. 482). It is unique in being a collection of first neuron cells buried in the central nervous system (p. 622).</p>
<p>Between the medial lemniscus and the central grey matter, the tegmentum contains fragments of grey matter broken up by criss-cross bundles of white fibers. The network appearance so produced gives it the name reticular formation. It is traceable through the pons (p. 609) and medulla into the upper spinal cord, and is described further on page 611.</p>
<p>The midbrain is supplied by the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries as they curl around the cerebral peduncle. Medial and lateral central branches enter the crura to supply the substantia nigra and red nucleus and, on the dorsal aspect, supply the colliculi, grey matter around the aqueduct, and the pineal body. The veins drain for the most part into the basal vein as it passes around the peduncle. From the colliculi, some blood enters the great cerebral vein.</p>
<h2 id="pons">
  Pons
  <a class="anchor" href="#pons">#</a>
</h2>
<p>When looking at the brain from below (ventrally), the pons is an easily recognized central feature - a broad transverse mass between the midbrain and medulla (Fig. 7.22), curving at the sides to sink into the cerebellum as the middle cerebellar peduncle (Fig. 7.6). The only cranial nerve to emerge from the pons, the fifth, does so by a large sensory and small motor root; their point of emergence marks the change of name from pons to peduncle. The two nerve roots pass forwards together in the posterior cranial fossa (i.e., below the tentorium) to run over the groove on the apex of the petrous bone into the trigeminal cave in the middle cranial fossa (Fig. 6.94, p. 566).</p>
<p>The ventral surface of the pons shows a shallow midline groove with a bulge on either side. The bulge is due to the underlying mass of pontine nuclei, intermingled with corticospinal and corticonuclear fibers (see below). This ventral surface lies along the clivus, separated from the bone by the subarachnoid pontine cistern, in which the basilar artery runs upwards. The artery may or may not lie in the midline groove; usually, it has a gentle curve to one side. The superior cerebellar artery curls round the upper margin of the pons. The labyrinthine artery passes laterally to reach the internal acoustic meatus. The sixth nerve runs upwards across the ventral surface to enter the dura on the clivus, while the seventh and eighth emerge more laterally at the junction of pons and medulla. Most laterally, the flocculus of the cerebellum and the choroid plexus that has emerged from the lateral recess of the fourth ventricle lie beside its lower border, in the cerebellopontine angle (Fig. 7.22).</p>
<p>The dorsal surface of the pons is concealed by the attached cerebellum. The aqueduct of the midbrain opens out at the upper border of the pons into the cavity of the fourth ventricle, which is mostly pontine but medullary at its lower end (p. 610). The pontine part of the roof of the ventricle consists only of a thin sheet of white matter, the superior medullary velum (Fig. 7.24), upon which lies the lingula of the cerebellum. The velum is attached at each side to the superior cerebellar peduncles.</p>
<p>Sections of the pons are recognized by the mass of cells and fibers occupying the large ventral part (Figs 7.27 and 7.28), quite distinct in shape from the rather rectangular crura of the midbrain peduncles (Figs 7.25 and 7.26) and the bulges of the medulla (Figs 7.29-7.31). The dorsal feature in the upper pons is the almost rectangular but closed cavity of the fourth ventricle; sections of the lower pons, which contains the widest part of the floor of the fourth ventricle, are usually presented as a broad band (without any ventricular roof) with cut edges at each side (the transected middle cerebellar peduncles).</p>
<p>In the ventral part, the cells are the pontine nuclei, from which fibers emerge to cross to the opposite side and form the middle cerebellar peduncle. With the various corticopontine fibers that have traveled down in the cerebral peduncles to synapse with the pontine nuclei, they complete an extensive corticopontocerebellar pathway.</p>
<p>The motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve is in the upper pons below the lateral part of the floor of the fourth ventricle. The fibers pass ventrally and laterally to emerge as already noted as a small motor root at the junction of the pons and the middle cerebellar peduncle.</p>
<p>Lateral to the motor nucleus is the main sensory nucleus of the trigeminal nerve. It receives those incoming fibers of the sensory root subserving touch. Its caudal continuation into the lower pons (and medulla) is the spinal nucleus, which receives pain and temperature fibers, while its upward continuation is largely a small bundle of fibers but with some cell bodies, the mesencephalic tract of the trigeminal, leading to the mesencephalic nucleus (p. 607) for proprioception.</p>
<p>In the lower part of the pons, the abducent nucleus lies near the midline just below the floor of the fourth ventricle, but with fibers of the facial nerve overlying it. The abducent nucleus plus the overlying facial nerve fibers form a small swelling, the facial colliculus, in the ventricular floor (Fig. 7.24). The facial nucleus itself lies deeper and farther from the midline; note therefore that the facial nucleus is not responsible for the facial colliculus.</p>
<p>A collection of cells alongside the facial nucleus forms the superior salivary nucleus (parasympathetic). It provides axons which pass out in the nervus intermedius part of the facial nerve and reach the pterygopalatine and submandibular ganglia. The lower part forms the inferior salivary nucleus, just above the pontomedullary junction; its fibers join the glossopharyngeal nerve to reach the otic ganglion.</p>
<p>The nuclei of the vestibulocochlear nerve lie beneath the floor of the lateral angle of the fourth ventricle (the vestibular area) in both the pons and medulla; vestibular and cochlear nuclei are separate. The vestibular fibers that emerge from the internal acoustic meatus pass anterior to the inferior cerebellar peduncle of the medulla and synapse in the vestibular nuclei, many of whose fibers pass back into that peduncle. Other fibers join the medial longitudinal bundle and connect with extraocular nuclei and cervical anterior horn cells. Some of these connections provide the basis for the vestibulo-ocular reflexes (p. 515).</p>
<p>The cochlear nuclei are mainly medullary but extend into the lower pons. They receive fibers from the spiral ganglia of the cochlea and send their axons to dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei. Axons from these form the decussating trapezoid body (p. 637), part of the auditory pathway.</p>
<p>The very uppermost ends of the dorsal nucleus of the vagus and the nucleus of the tractus solitarius also extend into the pons but essentially belong to the medulla, where they are described.</p>
<p>The pontine part of the reticular formation (p. 611) lies dorsal to the pontine nuclei and their intermingled fibers.</p>
<p>The pons is supplied mainly by pontine branches from the basilar artery, with contributions from the superior cerebellar and anterior inferior cerebellar vessels. Venous return is into the inferior petrosal sinuses and the basilar plexus.</p>
<h2 id="medulla-oblongata">
  Medulla Oblongata
  <a class="anchor" href="#medulla-oblongata">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The medulla oblongata extends between the pons and spinal cord. It lies almost vertically from a line joining the jugular tubercles of the occipital bone to the atlas, thus passing through the foramen magnum. It is embraced dorsally by the convex cerebellar hemispheres and lies in the deep groove between them, the vallecula of the cerebellum. The lower end which contains the upward continuation of the central canal of the spinal cord is commonly called the closed part of the medulla, while the upper end, where the canal comes to the surface as the lower part of the floor of the fourth ventricle, is the open part.</p>
<p>Ventrally (Fig. 7.22), the upper part of the medulla is deeply grooved in the midline, with a bold convexity on either side, the pyramid, due to the contained corticospinal fibers. Lateral to the pyramid is another convexity, the olive, due to the underlying inferior olivary nucleus. Lateral to the olive, the lateral surface of the medulla is formed by the inferior cerebellar peduncle, which enters the cerebellum medial to and below the middle peduncle.</p>
<p>The last seven cranial nerves all have attachments related to the medulla. The sixth nerve emerges between the pons and the pyramid, with the main part of the seventh nerve between the pons and the olive, and the nervus intermedius part of the seventh and the eighth nerve at the junction of the pons and the inferior cerebellar peduncle. The rootlets of the ninth, tenth, and cranial part of the eleventh nerves emerge lateral to the olive, and those of the twelfth by two small groups of rootlets between the pyramid and the olive.</p>
<p>Dorsally, the lower part of the floor of the fourth ventricle forms the upper part of the medulla (Fig. 7.24). Here the roof of the ventricle is ependyma and pia mater (p. 613). At the lower corner of the diamond-shaped floor, the hypoglossal trigone is adjacent to the midline, with the vagal trigone lateral to it. Higher up and at the lateral corners of the diamond is the vestibular area and the medullary striae (p. 614).</p>
<p>The naked-eye appearance of a section through the upper part of the medulla is instantly recognizable by the bulges of the pyramid and olive and the sac-like olivary nucleus (Fig. 7.29). The lower medulla still has the pyramids ventrally, but now there are gracile and cuneate tubercles dorsally. Visible decussation of the pyramids characterizes the lowest part of the medulla, and at a slightly higher level is seen the central decussation of the fibers forming the medial lemnisci (Figs 7.30 and 7.31).</p>
<p>Most of the nuclei of the medulla are below the floor of the fourth ventricle. The hypoglossal nucleus underlies the hypoglossal trigone, and the dorsal nucleus of the vagus is under the vagal trigone; more laterally are the nucleus of the tractus solitarius and the spinal nucleus and tract of the trigeminal nerve, with the vestibular and cochlear nuclei at the dorsal edge. At a deeper level is the nucleus ambiguus, with the inferior olivary nucleus ventrally.</p>
<p>The dorsal nucleus of the vagus contains motor cell bodies for cardiac and visceral muscle and the cells of secretomotor fibers for glands (in particular those of the stomach). Although the nucleus in the past has been considered to be a mixed nucleus with afferent cell bodies as well as motor, recent investigators believe that the sensory cells properly belong to the nucleus of the tractus solitarius. Afferent fibers form the tract which is almost surrounded by cells of the nucleus. The nuclei of the two sides meet in the lowest part of the open medulla, so they appear jointly as a V-shaped collection of cells as viewed dorsally. The cells are the most tightly packed of any brainstem nucleus. Its upper part receives taste fibers from the chorda tympani (nervus intermedius part of the facial nerve), lingual branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve, and internal laryngeal branch of the vagus. The rest of the nucleus receives many afferent fibers of the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves from thoracic and abdominal viscera, including those from the baroreceptors and chemoreceptors of the carotid sinus and carotid body and the aortic arch and aortic bodies (p. 438 and 256). It has extensive connections with the dorsal nucleus of the vagus and the reticular formation, and is an important component of the pathways for the cough (p. 503), sneeze (p. 473), gag (p. 496), and vomiting (p. 334) reflexes. Some of its cells form the inspiratory center (p. 253).</p>
<p>The nucleus ambiguus is a column of cells in the reticular formation of the upper medulla. It is the motor nucleus for the skeletal muscle of the larynx, soft palate, pharynx, and upper esophagus, all distributed by branches of the vagus except for the supply to stylopharyngeus which is by the glossopharyngeal nerve. The cells of the upper part of the nucleus send their fibers to the palate, those of the middle part reach the pharynx and esophagus, while those from the lowest part supply the larynx.</p>
<p>Fibers from the dorsal vagal nucleus are joined by those from the nucleus ambiguus and the nucleus of the tractus solitarius, contributing to the glossopharyngeal, vagal, and accessory nerve rootlets emerging lateral to the olive.</p>
<p>The spinal nucleus (and tract) of the trigeminal nerve continues down into the medulla from the pons (p. 609) and lies lateral to the nucleus of the tractus solitarius.</p>
<p>The inferior olivary nucleus is a crenated C-shaped lamina of grey matter, in section like a wrinkled sac with an open end facing towards the opposite inferior cerebellar peduncle. Its fibers (olivocerebellar) decussate across the midline to enter this peduncle (p. 619).</p>
<p>The cochlear and vestibular nuclei extend into the medullary part of the floor of the fourth ventricle, and have been considered with the pons (see above).</p>
<p>The gracile and cuneate nuclei underlie the corresponding tubercles of the dorsal surface of the lower medulla. They contain the cell bodies on which the incoming fibers of the gracile and cuneate tracts of the spinal cord terminate, and the nuclei give origin to the medial lemniscus (p. 613). Some cuneate cells constitute the accessory cuneate nucleus, whose fibers (cuneocerebellar) convey proprioceptive impulses from the upper limb to the cerebellum (via the inferior peduncle), instead of by the usual pathway for such impulses in the spinocerebellar tracts.</p>
<p>The medullary reticular formation, continuous upwards with that of the pons and downwards into the spinal cord at the lateral margin of the central grey matter, is the irregular mass of cells and fibers occupying much of the area between the inferior olivary nucleus and the floor of the fourth ventricle, intermingled with other cell groups and tracts. Certain cells of the reticular formation, in the region of the vagal nucleus and tractus solitarius, constitute the cardiac, respiratory, and vasomotor centers, often collectively known in the past as the vital centers. They are not anatomically demonstrable as distinct nuclei, but major disturbances of this area result in death (p. 616), which seems adequate reason to call them vital centers in spite of the current fashion to drop the term.</p>
<p>Although anatomically such a diffuse entity, the brainstem reticular formation is of great physiological significance, being responsible for the alert or wakeful component of consciousness. It plays a part in the control of many other functions, including motor activity (as part of the extrapyramidal system), sensory function (by modifying sensory input to the thalamus), autonomic activity (via the medullary vital centers), and circadian rhythms and endocrine secretion (via the hypothalamus). Among its many specific connections are those from the cerebral cortex of the same side via the corpus striatum and globus pallidus (p. 581), from the opposite cerebellar hemisphere via the dentate nucleus (p. 618), and from the hypothalamus and other components of the limbic system (p. 588). Some reticular formation cells give origin to the reticulospinal tracts (p. 613) which are part of the extrapyramidal system, and others receive spinoreticular fibers which are part of the pain pathway from the spinal cord (p. 624). Further cells provide important communications between cranial nerve nuclei, e.g., for eye movements, the corneal reflex, swallowing, etc.</p>
<p>The medulla is supplied ventrally by branches of the vertebral and basilar arteries, and laterally and dorsally by the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (Fig. 7.23). The anterior spinal branch of the vertebral gives penetrating branches which supply the region next to the midline, i.e., the part containing the pyramid, medial lemniscus, and hypoglossal nucleus. Damage to these vessels produces the medial medullary syndrome - paralysis of the tongue on the same side and hemiplegia with loss of touch and kinesthetic sense on the opposite side. Damage to the vessels of the lateral and dorsal part gives rise to the lateral medullary syndrome or syndrome of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. The loss of nucleus ambiguus function paralyzes the vocal fold and palatal and pharyngeal muscles on that side, giving dysphonia and dysphagia. Loss of the uncrossed spinal tract of the trigeminal and of the crossed spinal lemniscus results in loss of pain and temperature sensation on the same side of the face and opposite side of the body. There will also be a Horner&rsquo;s syndrome (p. 519) on the ipsilateral side due to interruption of the descending sympathetic pathway. Involvement of the vestibular nuclei causes vertigo and nystagmus with nausea and vomiting.</p>
<p>The veins drain dorsally to the occipital sinus and ventrally into the basilar plexus of veins and the inferior petrosal sinus. The medullary veins communicate with the spinal veins.</p>
<h2 id="brainstem-tracts">
  Brainstem Tracts
  <a class="anchor" href="#brainstem-tracts">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Some tracts in the brainstem begin from cell groups therein, but most are passing through from the rest of the brain to the spinal cord or vice versa. The most important of the long descending tracts are the corticonuclear and corticospinal fibers concerned with voluntary movement, supplemented for posture and coordination of movement by reticulospinal and vestibulospinal tracts which begin in the brainstem. The main ascending tracts are the medial lemniscus for touch and associated sensations, beginning in the medulla, and the spinal lemniscus and spinoreticulothalamic fibers for pain and temperature, beginning in the cord and brainstem respectively. While reading the descriptions of these and other tracts, frequent reference should again be made to the brainstem sections in Figures 7.25 to 7.31.</p>
<p>Cells in layer 5 of the sensorimotor area MsI (p. 586) give rise to corticospinal and corticonuclear fibers, by clinical convention often collectively called pyramidal (though some authorities confine this term to corticospinal fibers, which pass through the pyramid of the medulla, hence the name. Corticonuclear fibers were formerly called corticobulbar, &ldquo;bulb&rdquo; was an old name for the lower brainstem). However, only 40% of all these fibers come from this motor area (though they appear to be the ones that matter most); the remainder come from widely scattered areas of the cortex and not just other parts of the frontal lobes. They pass through the corona radiata, and the corticonuclear fibers then run down through the genu of the internal capsule (p. 583) into the brainstem. Some will go straight to the oculomotor and trochlear nuclei, and the others collect in the most medial part of the central three-fifths of the crus of the midbrain. From there, they run down to reach the motor nuclei of the rest of the brainstem. Cranial nerve nuclei which send their fibers to skeletal muscle are mostly bilaterally innervated (i.e., from the cortex of both hemispheres, although there are individual variations). The most important exception is the lower part of the facial nucleus, which is only supplied by the opposite cortex (p. 641).</p>
<p>The corticospinal fibers lie in the anterior two-thirds of the posterior limb of the internal capsule (p. 583). Continuing down to the brainstem, they occupy the central and lateral parts of the central three-fifths of the crus of the midbrain peduncle, with the arm fibers medial to the leg fibers. In the pons, the fibers become broken up into small bundles among the pontine nuclei; in longitudinal sections, they form naked-eye white strands. Passing on to the medulla, the bundles collect into a single large mass forming the bulging pyramid adjacent to the midline. Each pyramid contains about 1 million nerve fibers of which 700,000 are small and myelinated (1-4 µm diameter). In the lowest part of the medulla, 85% of the fibers cross to the opposite side in the motor decussation (decussation of the pyramids) to form the lateral corticospinal tract of the cord (p. 625). Some of the decussating fibers may be seen on the surface. The few uncrossed fibers continue downwards as the anterior corticospinal tract, but they also eventually cross in the spinal cord, where all fibers end in the anterior horn (p. 621).</p>
<p>After arising from many areas of all four lobes of the cortex, corticopontine fibers pass through all parts of the internal capsule to the crus of the midbrain peduncle. Frontopontine fibers occupy the medial one-fifth, and temporo-, parieto-, and occipitopontine fibers occupy the lateral one-fifth. All end by synapsing with cells of the pontine nuclei (p. 608) whose axons decussate to form the pontocerebellar fibers of the middle cerebellar peduncle. This is one of the pathways by which the cerebral cortex communicates with the cerebellar cortex.</p>
<p>The superior cerebellar peduncles (p. 619) enter the midbrain tegmentum and decussate at the level of the inferior colliculi on their way to the red nuclei (at superior colliculus level), whose efferent fibers form the rubrospinal tracts which immediately decussate (in the ventral tegmental decussation) before passing downwards. Just dorsal is the smaller dorsal tegmental decussation, formed by the crossing of the tectospinal tracts.</p>
<p>The medial longitudinal bundle lies immediately ventral to the grey matter round the aqueduct, and remains adjacent to the midline at lower levels. It extends from the upper border to the midbrain to the upper cervical part of the spinal cord. It links the vestibular nuclei with a number of motor nuclei, in particular the third, fourth, and sixth, to help coordinate audiovisual reflexes and movements of the eyes, head, and neck (with which the small tectospinal and rubrospinal tracts assist; they descend no farther than the cervical region of the cord).</p>
<p>The lateral and anterior reticulospinal tracts arise from the medullary and pontine parts of the reticular formation respectively. They are rather ill-defined in the brainstem, and their fibers become largely mixed with corticospinal fibers in the spinal cord. The lateral vestibulospinal tract originates from the lateral vestibular nucleus and soon enters the cord, where all these extrapyramidal tracts end in the anterior horn (p. 621).</p>
<p>The descending sympathetic tract from the hypothalamus and probably other higher centers is also ill-defined. Its fibers run in the region of the spinal lemniscus, and they end in the thoracolumbar lateral horn (p. 621).</p>
<p>The medial lemniscus, the main ascending pathway of the brainstem for touch and its associated sensations (p. 623), begins in the lower medulla, formed by the axons of the gracile and cuneate nuclei of the opposite side which have crossed (as internal arcuate fibers) in the sensory decussation. At first, the medial lemniscus lies longitudinally adjacent to the midline, but as it passes up through the pons and midbrain, it deviates laterally before reaching the thalamus. On its upward path, it is joined by the trigeminal lemniscus, fibers from the main sensory and spinal nuclei of the trigeminal nerve.</p>
<p>The spinal lemniscus is the upward continuation of the lateral spinothalamic (anterolateral) tract of the cord (pain and temperature, p. 624). It lies near the middle of the lateral part of the medulla, and runs up the brainstem at the lateral and then the dorsal edge of the medial lemniscus. It quickly becomes very much smaller, since most of its fibers end in the reticular formation rather than continuing all the way to the thalamus (p. 624).</p>
<p>The lateral lemniscus is formed by the upgoing fibers of the trapezoid body, the name given to transversely decussating fibers from the cochlear nuclei at the pontomedullary junction. This lemniscus terminates on cells of the inferior colliculus and medial geniculate body for auditory reflexes. Other fibers from the medial geniculate body pass to the auditory area of the cerebral cortex. Both the trapezoid body and lateral lemniscus contain cell stations which make connections with the extraocular nuclei via the medial longitudinal bundle.</p>
<p>The spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve consists of incoming pain and temperature fibers from the trigeminal nerve. Perhaps surprisingly, they pass down the brainstem before synapsing with the cells forming the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal, from which axons run up to join the medial lemniscus (see above).</p>
<p>The anterior and posterior spinocerebellar tracts lie at the lateral margin of the lower medulla. The posterior tract enters the inferior cerebellar peduncle, but the anterior tract continues up the lateral part of the brainstem to enter the superior peduncle.</p>
<h2 id="fourth-ventricle">
  Fourth Ventricle
  <a class="anchor" href="#fourth-ventricle">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The substance of the midbrain surrounds the aqueduct, and the substance of the lower medulla surrounds the central canal. However, between the two, the substance of pons and upper medulla lies ventral, and the central canal is expanded into a cavity, the fourth ventricle, which is roofed in by little more than ependyma and pia mater (Fig. 7.6).</p>
<p>The roof is updrawn into a tent shape (the ridge-pole of the tent lying transversely) and is covered by the cerebellum. The upper part of the roof lies over the pons. The ependyma here is covered with a thin sheet of white matter, the superior medullary velum, which is bounded by the superior cerebellar peduncles (Fig. 7.24). The lower part of the roof lies over the medulla. The ependyma is covered in its upper part by the inferior medullary velum, a thin sheet of white matter from the base of the flocculus, but in the lower part, ependyma and pia mater alone form the roof. The lower margin of the roof is attached to the margins of the gracile and cuneate tubercles and is perforated by a midline slit, the median aperture (foramen of Magendie), by which cerebrospinal fluid escapes into the cerebellomedullary cistern.</p>
<p>The cavity is prolonged laterally as a narrow lateral recess around and behind the inferior cerebellar peduncle; here the roof is attached to the margins of the medullary striae (see below). The narrow, tubular lateral recess has a patent extremity, the lateral aperture (foramen of Luschka), which opens anteriorly, just behind the eighth nerve, into the pontine cistern (Fig. 7.22). Through these three apertures (one median and two lateral), the cerebrospinal fluid escapes from the ventricular system into the subarachnoid space for absorption by the arachnoid villi. These are the only exits from the system; if blocked, e.g., following meningitis, the result is hydrocephalus. The extent of the lateral recess is indicated by the cast in Figure 7.9.</p>
<p>The choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle is a small bilateral L-shaped structure which indents the medullary part of the roof. It commences at the lateral aperture by a branch of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. Here it lies just below the flocculus. It indents the roof of the lateral recess, passes medially to meet its fellow, and the two turn down towards the median aperture. Together they form a T-shaped plexus, with the central stem being double. The veins from the plexus drain back into the occipital sinus.</p>
<p>The floor of the fourth ventricle is diamond shaped and properly known as the rhomboid fossa (Fig. 7.24). The upper boundaries are the superior cerebellar peduncles, the lower are formed by the gracile and cuneate tubercles and their underlying nuclei and, above them, by the inferior cerebellar peduncles. A midline groove, the median sulcus, runs from the aperture of the aqueduct of the midbrain above to the commencement of the central canal below. On each side of the groove, the floor is symmetrical. At its widest part, the floor is crossed transversely by glistening white fibers, the medullary striae. They lie between pontine and medullary parts of the floor, and are aberrant fibers from pontine nuclei destined for the cerebellum by the inferior peduncle.</p>
<p>The pontine part of the floor is characterized by an elongated elevation adjacent to the median sulcus, the medial eminence (of no importance, but not to be confused with the median eminence in the floor of the third ventricle, - p. 594). Its lower end is slightly more prominent and forms the facial colliculus, overlying the recurving fibers of the facial nerve and the underlying abducent nucleus. The floor at the lateral angle of the diamond is the vestibular area, overlying the vestibular nuclei. Between the facial colliculus and the vestibular area is a groove, the superior fovea, which leads up to the opening of the aqueduct. In the upper part of the fovea is a small area, the locus caeruleus, the bluish color being caused by the underlying collection of pigmented cells which are noradrenergic with widespread connections but uncertain function. They are part of the reticular formation.</p>
<p>The medullary part of the floor is smaller than the pontine part. Its lateral angle is occupied by the lower part of the vestibular area. From the inferior angle, a groove (the inferior fovea) passes up to the medullary striae to meet the edge of the vestibular area. The groove divides the floor into two small triangular regions. The medial one, with the apex down, is the hypoglossal trigone. Beneath it lies the twelfth nerve nucleus. The lateral triangle, apex upwards, lies between the hypoglossal and vestibular nuclei. It overlies the dorsal nucleus of the vagus and is the vagal trigone.</p>
<h2 id="cerebrospinal-fluid">
  Cerebrospinal Fluid
  <a class="anchor" href="#cerebrospinal-fluid">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is largely produced by the choroid plexuses of the third, lateral, and fourth ventricles, but about 30% comes from other brain capillaries and seeps into the system by the extracellular fluid. The total volume of CSF is about 130 ml (at a pressure of approximately 130 mm of water), of which about 30 ml are within the ventricular system and 100 ml in the subarachnoid space (75 ml in the spinal part and 25 ml in the cranial part). The total production is over 500 ml per day, but there is constant circulation and resorption which takes place mainly through the arachnoid granulations (p. 559). There is also some drainage through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone in the anterior cranial fossa (p. 568) into the tissues of the nose and so into the cervical lymphatics. Changes in arterial pressure have little effect on CSF pressure, but increases in venous pressure, with the accompanying distension of veins and venous sinuses within the skull, are quickly reflected in CSF pressure. Lumbar puncture will of course reduce the pressure, and if the site of puncture continues to leak, the pressure will remain low for some days.</p>
<p>The CSF provides a protective buffer for neural tissue and a waterbath in which the brain can float, thus effectively reducing the 1500 g weight of the brain to 50 g. It is also an important pathway for the removal of brain metabolites; there is no brain-CSF barrier, but the ependymal cells of the ventricles, which cover the choroid plexuses, have selective transport mechanisms and tight junctions between adjacent cells that provide a blood-CSF barrier (similar to the blood-brain barrier p. 600).</p>

  Summary of Cranial Nerve Nuclei
  <a class="anchor" href="#summary-of-cranial-nerve-nuclei">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The cranial nerve nuclei have been noted in the preceding account of the internal structure of the brainstem, but it may be helpful now to list them separately (Fig. 7.38). Summaries of the courses of the nerves themselves and of the effects of nerve lesions begin on page 629.</p>
<p>Those cranial nerves that have motor nuclei for supplying skeletal muscle (somatic nuclei, or branchial if derived from pharyngeal arches, p. 627) send their fibers direct to the muscles concerned. Nuclei for cardiac and visceral muscle and for glands (visceral nuclei, p. 627) send their fibers for peripheral relay in autonomic ganglion cells.</p>
<p>The sensory nuclei of cranial nerves are in fact the cell bodies of the second sensory neurons; the cell bodies of the first neurons are outside the CNS, in the ganglia on the nerves themselves (corresponding to the posterior root ganglia of spinal nerves). The central processes of the cells in the nuclei go to the usual three sensory destinations: (1) to motor nuclei for reflex effects, (2) to the cerebellum, and (3) to the opposite thalamus for relay to the sensory cortex. There is a solitary exception: the mesencephalic part of the trigeminal nucleus contains the cell bodies of the first neuron on the proprioceptive pathway from muscles of the orbit, face, and (probably) tongue.</p>

<p>The combined developments of ventilatory machines and transplantation surgery have underlined the need for defining the criteria for making a correct diagnosis of brain death - the irreversible cessation of brainstem function. In a comatose patient with irremediable structural brain damage due to a disorder that can lead to brain death (after excluding the effects of drugs, hypothermia, and endocrine and metabolic disturbances, all of which may produce functional brain damage), brainstem reflexes must be shown to be absent in order to establish brain death. The following are the criteria normally adopted, with page references to their anatomical basis:</p>
<ul>
<li>No pupillary response to light (p. 518).</li>
<li>No corneal reflex (p. 507).</li>
<li>No vestibulo-ocular reflexes (p. 515).</li>
<li>No gag reflex (p. 496).</li>
<li>No cough reflex (p. 503).</li>
<li>No motor response in the cranial nerve distribution to painful stimulation of the supraorbital margins (connections between trigeminal and facial nerve nuclei) or on the bases of fingernails (connections between cervical spinal cord and facial nerve nuclei).</li>
<li>No respiratory movements when disconnected from the ventilator long enough to ensure that the arterial CO₂ rises above the threshold for respiratory stimulation (Pco₂ &gt; 50 mm Hg, 6.7 kPA).</li>
</ul>
<p>The cerebellum can be considered as a brainstem nucleus which, in the course of vertebrate evolution, has become so big that it has grown increasingly far back onto the dorsal surface of the brainstem (Fig. 7.32). It occupies the posterior cranial fossa, and consists of two hemispheres united in the midline by the vermis. Three peduncles connect each hemisphere to the three parts of the brainstem. The superior peduncle enters the midbrain, the middle peduncle consists of the transverse fibers of the pons, and the inferior peduncle connects it to the medulla. The ventral surface of the vermis lies upon the superior medullary velum above and the roof of the medullary part of the fourth ventricle below.</p>
<p>The ancients gave many fanciful names to different parts of the cerebellar surface. The parts of the vermis so named chance to have functional and morphological significance, but the named parts of the hemispheres are functionally meaningless and can be ignored. But it is helpful to correlate certain parts of the cerebellum with their evolutionary history. Reference will be made below to the archaeocerebellum, the oldest part and concerned with balance (vestibular mechanisms); the paleocerebellum, which developed later to assist in the control of limb movements (spinal mechanisms); and the neocerebellum, the most recently developed part which evolved in association with the increasing complexity of the cerebral hemispheres (cerebral mechanisms).</p>
<p>The cerebellum is deeply grooved, the vallecula, which lodges the three parts of the inferior vermis.</p>
<p>The surface of the cerebellum is indented by fine slit-like sulci, between which lie more or less parallel cerebellar folia. In the main, the folia and sulci lie transversely from side to side across the whole extent of the cerebellum. Several transverse fissures pass deeply into the substance; the folia extend into their depths.</p>
<p>A well-marked groove, the horizontal fissure (of no functional significance), indents the convex posterior border. This is the deepest sulcus of all; it extends from side to side and around towards the front, where its margins embrace the middle peduncle. Anterior to it, on the superior surface, is a much shallower groove, the primary fissure; this is significant, for it separates paleocerebellum and neocerebellum.</p>
<p>The hemispheres consist, then, of a small anterior lobe on the superior surface in front of the primary fissure and a large posterior lobe comprising the rest of the hemisphere behind the primary fissure (Fig. 7.32). This division possesses not only the advantage of simplicity, but is of morphological and functional significance: the anterior lobe is part of the paleocerebellum, the posterior lobe forms the neocerebellum.</p>
<p>The vermis consists of superior and inferior parts, separated from each other by the neocerebellar posterior lobes, which meet in the midline behind the primary fissure.</p>
<p>The lingula is that part of the superior vermis which lies in contact with the superior medullary velum. On the superior surface of the anterior lobe, there is no line of demarcation between vermis and cerebellar hemispheres.</p>
<p>In the vallecula, the inferior vermis consists of three small lobules which retain their ancient names of pyramid, uvula, and nodule. The nodule lies highest, on the roof of the fourth ventricle. Projecting laterally from each side of the nodule is a slender band of white matter whose bulbous extremity, capped with grey matter, can be seen from in front, lying in the angle between cerebellum and pons. This is the flocculus; the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle projects just below it (Fig. 7.1). The two flocculi and the nodule form the flocculonodular lobe; this and the lingula represent the archaeocerebellum.</p>
<p>The uvula and pyramid, larger than the nodule, occupy the remainder of the vallecula. With the anterior lobe, they form the paleocerebellum. Projecting laterally is a slender lobule, the paraflocculus, attached mainly to the pyramid. It lies beneath the flocculus. Slender in man, it is relatively enormous in the marine mammals (it may be concerned with preserving rotary stability about the long axis of the body).</p>
<h2 id="morphology">
  Morphology
  <a class="anchor" href="#morphology">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The cerebellum is imagined to have three distinct morphological parts, evolved sequentially, and possessing different functions.</p>
<p>The archaeocerebellum has vestibular connections only. It is represented in mammals by the lingula, the uvula, and the flocculonodular lobe. Lesions of this part produce vestibular symptoms: disturbances of equilibrium with no alteration to spinal reflexes. Fine movements are well performed, there is no nystagmus, no tremor, and no alteration of muscle reflexes. The condition is known as trunk ataxia - the victim walks as if drunk.</p>
<p>The paleocerebellum, which evolved between the lingula at the front and flocculonodular lobe at the back, so splitting the archaeocerebellum, has spinal connections (spinocerebellar tracts), and is concerned with postural and righting reflexes. It is represented in mammals by the anterior lobe, the pyramid and paraflocculus, and the uvula. Lesions of this part cause great disturbance of postural mechanisms with increased muscle reflexes.</p>
<p>The neocerebellum, superimposed dorsally upon the paleocerebellum, evolved between the anterior lobe and the pyramid, so splitting the paleocerebellum. It comprises the whole of the cerebellar hemispheres behind the primary fissure (i.e., it is synonymous with the posterior lobe, as distinct from the inferior vermis). It is best developed in man and has cerebropontine connections from the pontine nuclei via the middle peduncle. It is concerned in feedback circuits with the basal nuclei and the cerebral cortex. It functions in the control of the synergic background of muscle tone in the performance of accurate voluntary movements (p. 8). Lesions of the neocerebellum lead to such clinical features as hypotonia, diminished or pendulum muscle jerks, intention tremor, dysdiadochokinesia, and nystagmus.</p>
<p>The essential function of the cerebellum can thus be briefly summarized as the coordination of movement. Cerebellar lesions do not cause paralysis, but disturbances of movement and balance such as ataxia, intention tremor (absent at rest and best seen towards the end of the finger-nose test), nystagmus, and speech defects (dysarthria).</p>
<h2 id="internal-structure-2">
  Internal Structure
  <a class="anchor" href="#internal-structure-2">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Like the cerebrum, the cerebellum is surfaced with a cortex of grey matter, with the white matter internal. Each hemisphere contains subcortical nuclei of grey matter near the roof of the fourth ventricle. The dentate nucleus is the largest and most important. It forms a large crenated crescent, resembling the inferior olivary nucleus in the medulla (Fig. 7.33), open towards the superior peduncle. Its main connections are from the neocerebellum, and its efferent fibers leave the hilum and pass to the contralateral red nucleus and thalamus. Three small masses lie medial to the hilum of the dentate nucleus, the emboliform, globose, and fastigial nuclei (in that order, EGF from lateral to medial). From their proximity to the fourth ventricle, these nuclei are known collectively as the roof nuclei of the cerebellum. The fastigial nucleus belongs to the archaeocerebellum, the other two to the paleocerebellum.</p>
<p>The cerebellar cortex is very characteristic and is of identical appearance in all areas. Two equally thick cortical layers sandwich a single layer of Purkinje cells between them. The molecular layer of the cortex lies on the surface; it consists almost entirely of fibers, with a few cells scattered among them. These are called basket cells because their axons arborize in basket shape around the Purkinje cell bodies. The granular layer lies deep to the molecular layer and consists overwhelmingly of small round granular cells tightly packed together (in low power appearance somewhat resembling the lymphocytes in lymphoid tissue). The layer of Purkinje cells lies between the two and consists of very large flask-shaped cells lying separately at intervals.</p>
<p>The Purkinje dendrites form an elaborate branching pattern in the molecular layer. All the branches lie in one plane, like an ornamental tree spread out on a wall or the cross-beams on a telegraph pole. The plane of the dendrites lies at right angles to the long axis of a cerebellar folium. Adjacent dendrites lie crosswise along a folium, like telegraph poles along a roadside. The Purkinje axons pass through the granular layer, and relay in the dentate and other nuclei. Thence fibers run in the superior peduncle to the red nucleus, thalamus, and cerebral cortex of the opposite side.</p>
<h2 id="cerebellar-peduncles-and-connections">
  Cerebellar Peduncles and Connections
  <a class="anchor" href="#cerebellar-peduncles-and-connections">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The superior and middle peduncles are simple; the inferior peduncle contains a great mixture of fibers.</p>
<p>The superior peduncle contains a preponderance of efferent fibers, passing from the dentate nucleus to the red nucleus, thalamus, and cortex of the opposite side. It also contains the anterior spinocerebellar tract, passing to the anterior lobe (paleocerebellum) and tectocerebellar fibers from the midbrain.</p>
<p>The middle peduncle contains fibers from the pontine nuclei of the opposite side; they are afferent to the neocerebellum.</p>
<p>The inferior peduncle is predominantly afferent. The only efferent tract of note is the cerebellovestibular tract, from the roof nuclei to the vestibular nucleus of the same side, but there are also some cerebello-olivary and cerebelloreticular fibers. The afferent fibers to the vermis (archaeocerebellum) form the vestibulocerebellar tract, from the vestibular nucleus of the same side. Those to the anterior lobe (paleocerebellum) comprise the posterior spinocerebellar and cuneocerebellar tracts, the latter consisting of posterior external arcuate fibers from the accessory cuneate nucleus (for proprioception from the upper limb). Those to the posterior lobe (neocerebellum) form the olivocerebellar tract (from the olivary nuclei of the opposite side), and there are also fibers from pontine nuclei and the reticular formation.</p>
<h2 id="blood-supply">
  Blood Supply
  <a class="anchor" href="#blood-supply">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Two arteries supply the large convex undersurface and one artery supplies the small upper surface of each cerebellar hemisphere. They anastomose with each other on the cerebellar surface, but their perforating branches into the cerebellum are, as elsewhere in the nervous system, end arteries.</p>
<p>The posterior inferior cerebellar artery is one of the most tortuous arteries in the body, and is the largest branch of the vertebral artery. It arises ventrally from the vertebral artery, near the lower end of the olive, and spirals back around the medulla below the hypoglossal rootlets and then between the rootlets of the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. It supplies the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle and is distributed to the vallecula and the back of the cerebellar hemispheres. It supplies, in passing, the adjacent part of the medulla as described on page 611.</p>
<p>The anterior inferior cerebellar artery arises from the basilar artery at the lower part of the pons and passes back on the inferior surface of the cerebellar hemisphere, supplying this surface and the adjacent flocculus. It may give rise to the labyrinthine artery if it has not arisen from the basilar.</p>
<p>The superior cerebellar artery arises near the termination of the basilar and passes laterally to wind around the cerebral peduncle below the fourth nerve. It is distributed over the superior surface of the cerebellum.</p>
<p>Venous drainage is from the surface of the cerebellum into the nearest available venous sinus of the dura mater. Thus, the superior and posterior surfaces drain into the straight and transverse sinuses, inferior surfaces into the inferior petrosal, sigmoid, and occipital sinuses. The superior vermis drains anteriorly into the great cerebral vein at its entrance into the straight sinus.</p>
<p>The spinal cord, properly but not often called the spinal medulla, is a cylinder, somewhat flattened from front to back, whose lower end tapers into a cone. Ventrally, it possesses a deep midline groove, the anterior median fissure, and dorsally it shows a shallow posterior median sulcus, from which a posterior median septum of neuroglia extends into its substance. The posterior median septum within the spinal cord is attached to the incomplete posterior median septum of arachnoid in the subarachnoid space.</p>
<p>In the fetus, the spinal cord extends to the lower limit of the spinal dura mater at the level of S2 vertebra. The spinal dura remains attached at this level throughout life, but the spinal cord becomes relatively shorter, which is to say that the bony spinal column and the dura mater grow more rapidly than the spinal cord. Thus, at birth, the conus medullaris lies opposite L3 vertebra and does not reach its permanent level opposite L1 or L2 until about the age of 20 years. The spinal nerve roots, especially those of the lumbar and sacral segments, thus come to slope more and more steeply downwards (see below).</p>
<p>The spinal cord possesses two symmetrical enlargements which occupy the segments of the limb plexuses: as the cervical enlargement for the brachial plexus and the lumbosacral enlargement for the lumbar and sacral plexuses. They occupy, in the cord, the segmental levels of the plexuses concerned (C5 to T1 for the cervical enlargement and L2 to S3 for the lumbosacral enlargement), but their levels measured by vertebrae are, of course, quite different. Thus, the cervical enlargement lies roughly corresponding to the vertebrae C3 to T1, but the lumbosacral extends only from T9 to L1. Both enlargements are due to the greatly increased mass of motor cells in the anterior horns of grey matter in these situations.</p>

  Spinal Nerve Roots
  <a class="anchor" href="#spinal-nerve-roots">#</a>
</h2>
<p>No spinal nerves lie inside the spinal theca; indeed, no nerve lies, strictly speaking, within the vertebral canal. The anterior and posterior roots of the spinal nerves unite within the intervertebral foramina. Within the subarachnoid space, the nerve roots are attached to the spinal cord each by a series of rootlets. Each anterior root is formed by three or four rootlets which emerge irregularly along the anterolateral surface of the spinal cord. Each posterior root is formed by several rootlets, attached vertically to the posterolateral surface of the cord. A short distance from the cord, the rootlets are combined into a single root (Fig. 6.98, p. 575). The anterior and posterior roots pass from the cord to their appropriate intervertebral foramina, where each evaginates the dura mater separately before uniting to form the mixed spinal nerve. The ganglion on the posterior nerve root lies in the intervertebral foramen, within the tubular evagination of dura and arachnoid immediately proximal to the point of union of anterior and posterior nerve roots. However, the posterior root ganglia of cervical nerves lie just lateral to the intervertebral foramina, in contact with the vertebral artery (Fig. 6.96, p. 573). For all levels from C1 to L1 vertebrae, the anterior and posterior nerve roots pass in front of and behind the denticulate ligament respectively, and evaginate the dura mater between the denticulations (Fig. 6.98, p. 575). In conformity with the shortness of the spinal cord, the lower a nerve root, the more steeply it slopes down to the intervertebral foramen. The upper cervical roots are horizontal, the upper thoracic roots first slope down to their point of evagination of the meninges only to become kinked upwards at an angle to reach their foramen (Fig. 7.34). Below L1 vertebra, the roots pass almost vertically downwards through the subarachnoid space, forming the cauda equina; note that this consists not of spinal nerves but of nerve roots. The filum terminale (pia mater, p. 575) extends down from the tip of the conus medullaris among the nerve roots of the cauda (but is not classified as part of the cauda).</p>
<p>The roots of the spinal part of the accessory nerve emerge from the lateral surface of the upper five or six segments of the cord, behind the denticulate ligament. They unite into a single trunk which passes upwards through the foramen magnum into the cranium to join the cranial root (Fig. 6.96, p. 573).</p>
<h2 id="internal-structure-3">
  Internal Structure
  <a class="anchor" href="#internal-structure-3">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The spinal cord consists of a central mass of grey matter (cell bodies), in the form of a fluted column surrounding the central canal, enclosed in a cylindrical mass of white matter (fibers) (Fig. 7.35). It is almost divided into two halves by the anterior median fissure and the posterior median septum. The septum extends forwards as far as the grey commissure (the central limb of the H in cross-section); it connects the grey matter of the right and left halves of the cord. Centrally, it contains the central canal, the tiny downward continuation of the cavity of the fourth ventricle and like it lined by ependyma. It extends into the upper few millimeters of the filum terminale. The anterior fissure does not completely separate the white matter - a narrow white commissure lies anterior to the grey. Both the grey and white matter of the right and left halves are divided into anterior, lateral, and posterior columns of cells or fibers. From the cross-sectional appearance, the grey columns are usually referred to as anterior, lateral, and posterior horns, and it is convenient to use this term for the grey matter (containing nerve cell bodies), leaving &ldquo;column&rdquo; to indicate white matter (containing nerve fibers, i.e., tracts). Although transverse sections of the cord (like those of the brainstem) have to be studied in order to define the positions of tracts and cell groups, from the functional point of view, it is necessary to think vertically as well; although the component parts of reflex arcs, for example, may lie within a segment as seen transversely, most activity within the cord is in an up or down direction, and this is what must be appreciated.</p>
<p>The grey matter varies in shape and size at different levels (Fig. 7.36). The posterior white columns are largest in the cervical region, and the anterior grey horns largest in the cervical and lumbar regions.</p>
<p>The following account of selected cell groups and tracts is deliberately synoptic and simplified in order to emphasize the most important features as far as general anatomy and clinical relevance are concerned: those who need further information will consult specialist texts.</p>
<p>The central grey matter appears in sections like an H-girder (Fig. 7.36), especially in the thoracic region. The posterior horn stretches to the surface of the cord, but the anterior horn falls short of it. The cervical and lumbosacral enlargements are due to a great increase in the number of anterior horn cells, to provide fibers for the great nerve plexuses. The more medial anterior horn cells are concerned with the innervation of trunk musculature, with those more laterally placed supplying the limbs. Furthermore, the more ventral cells of the lateral group supply proximal limb muscles, and those more dorsally placed innervate the more distal limb muscles.</p>
<p>Between the limb enlargements, from segments T1 to L2, there is a small lateral horn, containing preganglionic sympathetic neurons.</p>
<p>The cells of the grey matter in each half of the cord lie in specific functional groups or laminae, designated by the Roman numerals I to X (Fig. 7.35). (The original research by Rexed defining these areas was carried out on the cat, but has been confirmed for primates and is believed to apply to the human cord also). Among the more important cell groups in the various laminae are those of lamina II which constitute the gelatinous substance; the cells of laminae III to VI form the nucleus proprius among which the cells of lamina V are a main source of anterolateral tract (spinothalamic and spinoreticular) fibers; lamina VII contains in its medial part the thoracic nucleus and laterally the thoracolumbar (sympathetic) and sacral (parasympathetic) lateral horn cells; other cells of lamina VII, together with those of lamina VIII, are interneurons involved in coordinating motor activity and projecting to lamina IX; lamina IX contains the α and γ motor neurons which innervate skeletal muscle, arranged in medial and lateral groups for axial and limb musculature as mentioned above.</p>
<p>The white matter of the spinal cord contains three kinds of fibers - ascending, descending, and intersegmental - and is divided into the three columns by the fluted grey matter and the attached nerve roots.</p>
<p>In each half of the cord, the posterior white column lies between the posterior median septum and the posterior grey horn. It is wholly occupied by the ascending fibers of the gracile and cuneate tracts, the pathways for touch and some associated sensations (p. 623).</p>
<p>The rest of the white matter forms the lateral and anterior white columns, the emerging anterior nerve roots providing a convenient dividing line between the two. Both these columns contain long ascending and descending tracts. In addition, short intersegmental (propriospinal) fibers run up and down adjacent to the central grey matter, forming communications between segments. The lateral white column contains (among others) the lateral corticospinal tract, the principal motor pathway and the most important of all cord tracts, and the anterolateral (spinothalamic) tract, which extends into the anterior white column and is the pathway for pain (nociception) and thermal sensations (differences between hot and cold), all commonly called the pain and temperature pathway. Details of these and some other significant tracts are given below. Although diagrams such as Figure 7.35 suggest that tracts are very circumscribed bundles like peripheral nerves, there is much intermingling of fibers and (except in the posterior columns) there are no sharp boundaries to tracts.</p>
<h2 id="afferent-pathways">
  Afferent Pathways
  <a class="anchor" href="#afferent-pathways">#</a>
</h2>
<p>There are three possible destinations for all incoming fibers: the cortex of the opposite cerebral hemisphere, via thalamic relay, for conscious sensation; the cerebellum, for muscular coordination; and the brainstem or spinal cord, for reflex actions.</p>
<p>As a guiding principle, it is usually stated that afferent impulses are conveyed to the cerebral cortex by three groups of neurons. While this is a convenient concept and accurate enough for understanding the main long-fiber components of neuronal pathways, it takes no account of the vast numbers of interneurons in the central nervous system whose activities may be highly important in modifying impulse conduction though difficult to investigate. The cell bodies of the first group of neurons (first neurons or first order neurons) always lie outside the central nervous system: in the posterior root ganglia of spinal nerves or the equivalent ganglia of cranial nerves. (There is one odd exception: the cell bodies of the proprioceptive neurons of the trigeminal nerve are not in the trigeminal ganglion but are within the central nervous system, in the mesencephalic nucleus - p. 607.) The cell bodies of the second neurons are in the spinal cord or brainstem, and those of the third group are in the thalamus.</p>
<h2 id="efferent-pathways">
  Efferent Pathways
  <a class="anchor" href="#efferent-pathways">#</a>
</h2>
<p>For the control of the skeletal muscles supplied by spinal nerves, two main systems of neurons are involved. One can be called the direct corticospinal pathway, consisting essentially of two groups of neurons. The cell bodies of the first are in the cerebral cortex, and their fibers extend through the internal capsule and brainstem to the anterior horn cells of the cord; these are the corticospinal fibers whose course through the cerebral hemisphere and brainstem has already been considered (p. 612), together with the corresponding corticonuclear fibers going to the motor nuclei of cranial nerves. These fibers, often called pyramidal (p. 612), with their cortical cell bodies can also be known as the upper motor neurons. The second neurons of this direct motor pathway are the anterior horn cells and their axons which end as the motor endplates on skeletal muscle fibers. These neurons (and those of the motor nuclei of cranial nerves) are often called the lower motor neurons.</p>
<p>The other system involves a whole series of neurons on the way to anterior horn cells (in contrast to the single pyramidal group). For example, cortical cells may send their axons to pontine nuclei, from which fibers run to the cerebellum (corticopontocerebellar pathway) which in turn may project to the red, reticular, vestibular, and olivary nuclei, all of which can communicate with the same anterior horn cells as pyramidal fibers. Other cortical fibers run to the basal nuclei (corpus striatum, p. 581) and thalamus, with projections from them to the red, reticular, and subthalamic nuclei and the substantia nigra. These brainstem nuclei can also be activated by reflex sensory pathways (e.g., light and sound). From some of these brainstem groups, fibers descend to synapse with the same anterior horn cells that have received corticospinal fibers. None of these fibers has passed through the pyramid of the medulla, hence the name extrapyramidal, and because none has passed uninterruptedly from the cortex to anterior horn cells, they can also be called indirect corticospinal pathways. Thus, there are many possible combinations of routes from cortex to cord, and ample opportunity for influencing the responses of anterior horn cells. Since anterior horn cells (and the equivalent motor nuclei of the brainstem) are at the receiving end of both direct and indirect corticospinal pathways, they and their axons (the lower motor neurons) are often called the final common path.</p>
<p>Although the purists may argue about the precise definitions of the terms pyramidal, extrapyramidal, and upper motor neuron, they remain widely used.</p>
<h2 id="ascending-tracts">
  Ascending Tracts
  <a class="anchor" href="#ascending-tracts">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The most important ascending tracts fall into two groups. Those in the posterior white columns are concerned with light (discriminative) touch and some other sensations that use the same tracts: vibration sense, proprioception (muscle-joint or kinesthetic sense, the conscious appreciation of body position and movement), and the sense of fullness of the bladder and rectum. Those in the lateral and anterior white columns are concerned with pain (nociception) and temperature sensations, crude touch, and the sensations of itch, tickle, and sexual orgasm. Here also are tracts to the cerebellum, for muscular coordination.</p>
<p>The posterior white column is wholly occupied by ascending fibers of the gracile and cuneate tracts. Their cell bodies lie in the posterior root ganglia of spinal nerves, and the fibers (large myelinated) enter the cord from the medial side of the posterior nerve roots. Some branches from the incoming posterior root fibers are short and take part in segmental reflex arcs, but it is the long ascending fibers that form the tracts. The fibers from the lowest parts of the body (segmentally speaking) lie nearest the midline, and incoming fibers are added progressively laterally, i.e., the column is laminated. In this way, fibers from the perineum, lower limb, and lower trunk form the gracile tract, and those from the upper trunk and upper limb form the more lateral cuneate tract. The two tracts end in the lower part of the medulla by synapsing with the cells of the gracile and cuneate nuclei respectively. The axons from these (second order) nuclei immediately decussate to form the medial lemniscus which runs through the brainstem to the thalamus (p. 613). After relay there, the axons of the third group of neurons pass via the internal capsule to area SmI of the cerebral cortex.</p>
<p>Tests for the types of sensation transmitted by the posterior columns include those for light touch, such as gentle stroking of the skin with the fingers or cotton wool. Position sense (often called postural sense) is tested by the examiner passively moving finger or great toe joints with the patient&rsquo;s eyes closed, to see whether the direction of movement can be appreciated. If upper limb position sense is disturbed, the patient cannot hold the outstretched limb and fingers steady with the eyes closed, nor perform the finger-nose test accurately. Similarly, lower limb position sense is tested by standing upright with the feet together and then closing the eyes. Without the visual sense to relate to the environment, there will be loss of balance with the eyes shut (Romberg&rsquo;s sign), if there is loss of this posterior column sense. For the same reason, there will be difficulty with walking in the dark, or keeping the balance when washing the face with the eyes shut. These are examples of sensory ataxia. (With labyrinthine lesions or cerebellar ataxia, there is little difference whether the eyes are open or shut.) Vibration sense, which is also conducted by the posterior columns, is tested by applying a vibrating tuning fork (128 Hz, middle C) to a bony prominence such as the lateral malleolus.</p>
<p>The two-point discrimination test is important because it not only involves the peripheral and central pathways, but the cerebral cortex as well. Two points 3 mm apart are normally distinguishable on the finger pads. Stereognostic sense (ability to appreciate the size and shape of objects in the hand) also requires the intact cortex.</p>
<p>The main ascending tract of the lateral and anterior white columns is now known as the anterolateral tract, the pathway for pain and temperature and crude touch. It has for long been divided into the lateral and anterior spinothalamic tracts, but it appears more accurate to consider it as one. It is a large bundle lying in front of the lateral corticospinal tract (and therefore in front of the level of attachment of the denticulate ligament) and extending into the anterior white column (and therefore penetrated by the efferent axons of anterior horn cells).</p>
<p>The pain fibers in peripheral nerves are of two kinds: small C fibers, unmyelinated and slow-conducting, for the dull, aching type of pain (&ldquo;slow pain&rdquo;), and Aδ fibers, thinly myelinated and fast-conducting for the sharp, pricking type of pain (&ldquo;fast pain&rdquo;) and also for temperature conduction. On entering the cord from the posterior nerve roots (from cell bodies in the posterior root ganglia), the fibers form the dorsolateral tract (of Lissauer). This is a composite name for these incoming fibers, which run up or down at the tip of the posterior horn for one or two segments before synapsing with cells of the gelatinous substance (mainly lamina II) which themselves may provide short intersegmental axons that enter this tract.</p>
<p>Through various interneurons in the region of the tip of the posterior horn, the impulses are passed on to the second order neurons whose fibers form the anterolateral tract. The tract originates mainly from cell bodies in laminae I and V, and the fibers cross to the opposite side of the cord in front of the central canal. Although in the lowest part of the cord, the fibers from any one segment cross transversely, the crossing takes place more and more obliquely at higher levels so that in the cervical region, the decussation may require the height of four or five segments before it is completed. The tract is laminated, with fibers subserving impulses from the sacral segments lying most laterally, while those from cervical segments are the most deeply placed (Fig. 7.35). The fibers for crude touch occupy the more medial part of the tract (the old anterior spinothalamic part), and have crossed less obliquely than the pain and temperature fibers.</p>
<p>Only about 10% of anterolateral tract fibers pass directly to the thalamus, via the spinal lemniscus of the brainstem (p. 613). The other 90% of fibers synapse with cells of the brainstem reticular formation, where there may be multiple connections before the onward transmission of impulses to the thalamus; this is the spinoreticulothalamic pathway. Third order neurons then pass from the thalamus to the sensory cortex. Note that, strictly speaking, these pain and temperature pathways form an exception to the three-neuron rule; in the gelatinous substance and other parts of the posterior horn, there are various interneuronal connections, and there are undefined numbers of synapses in the reticular formation. Nevertheless, there are only three groups of neurons with long fibers, so the general concept of a three-neuron pathway is still useful.</p>
<p>The extent to which the anterolateral tract cells are stimulated to pass on impulses from spinal cord to brain is subject to control and modification by both spinal and supraspinal influences. For example, large myelinated (Ia) fibers from mechanoreceptors, apart from passing up in the posterior white columns, give branches that synapse with anterolateral tract cells, and their effect is to inhibit transmission from the tract cells (closing the gate to nociceptive impulses); hence the effectiveness of rubbing an injured part to reduce the pain. Other inhibitory influences come from supraspinal levels via the reticular formation, so that cerebral and limbic activities such as memory, past experience, and emotion can depress or even completely suppress pain - as happens in battle casualties who may feel no pain at the time of severe injury. The investigation of pain transmission and perception has been given great impetus by the discovery that certain areas of the nervous system (e.g., the thalamus, limbic system, and gelatinous substance) produce their own morphine-like substances (endogenous opioid peptides), such as endorphins and enkephalins, which can inhibit pain by binding to receptors on parts of the pain pathway. Some of these substances may act as modulators of the transmission of pain impulses or may themselves be transmitters. They do not pass the blood-brain barrier (p. 600) and so cannot be given intravenously.</p>
<p>The common tests for pain sensation are by pinprick for superficial pain (spinothalamic) and by pinching or squeezing a fold of skin, muscle, or tendon, such as the Achilles tendon, for deep pain (spinoreticulothalamic). Temperature sense can be estimated by touching the skin with a cold metal object and a test-tube of warm water.</p>
<p>In the operation of anterolateral cordotomy for the relief of persistent pain, the lateral part of the anterolateral tract is severed to block upward transmission through the tract. The knife is inserted in front of the line of attachment of the denticulate ligament, so avoiding damage to the corticospinal tract which lies behind this. Because of the obliquity of the crossing of fibers, the cut must be made several segments above the desired level of analgesia. Although cordotomy should theoretically result in permanent pain relief, it rarely lasts for more than a few months (2 years at the most) - an example of the plasticity of the nervous system and the way new pathways can develop.</p>
<p>The anterior and posterior spinocerebellar tracts convey unconscious proprioceptive information from cord to cerebellum, as their names imply. Some fibers from posterior root ganglion cells enter the cord through the posterior roots and synapse with the cells of the thoracic nucleus (Clarke&rsquo;s column) in lamina VII at the base of the posterior horn in all the thoracic and first two lumbar segments of the cord. The axons of these cells move to the lateral edge of their own side of the cord as the posterior spinocerebellar tract, which runs up into the medulla to reach the cerebellum by the inferior peduncle (p. 619). Other incoming fibers synapse with other posterior horn cells, mainly of lamina VII, in lumbar and sacral segments; these give rise to fibers which mostly cross to the opposite side to form the anterior spinocerebellar tract, at the margin of the cord behind the anterior nerve roots. It takes an unexpectedly long route to the cerebellum, running through the brainstem to the midbrain and doubling back into the superior cerebellar peduncle (p. 619). From cervical nerves, impulses destined for the cerebellum do not travel by these spinocerebellar tracts (since the thoracic nucleus does not extend above T1 level); they reach the accessory cuneate nucleus by the cuneate tract, and thence by the cuneocerebellar tract enter the inferior peduncle (p. 619).</p>
<p>A number of ill-defined groups of ascending fibers such as spinoreticular, spino-olivary, spinotectal, spinovestibular, and spinospinal provide further connections between the cord and brainstem and between different parts of the cord for reflex activities.</p>
<h2 id="descending-tracts">
  Descending Tracts
  <a class="anchor" href="#descending-tracts">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The lateral corticospinal tract, the most important of all tracts, is formed from the motor decussation in the lower medulla, and the cortical origin of the fibers has already been described (p. 612). The tract lies in the lateral white column at a level behind the attachment of the denticulate ligament. The arm fibers cross at a slightly higher level than the leg fibers. The tract gets smaller as it passes down the cord since fibers are leaving it at all levels to reach the anterior horn. Almost all (98%) of the fibers end by synapsing with interneurons (laminae VII and VIII) which in turn project to the α and γ motor neurons of lamina IX of the anterior horn. (The 2% of fibers that synapse directly with motor neurons are those originating from the giant Betz cells.) About 55% of corticospinal fibers end on cervical and first thoracic anterior horn cells, i.e., more than half of the corticospinal fibers are concerned with the motor supply of the upper limb, leaving 20% for trunk supply and 25% for the lower limb. Because of the medullary decussation, the cerebral cortex of one side controls the muscles of the contralateral side.</p>
<p>The relatively unimportant uncrossed fibers in the medulla continue as the anterior corticospinal tract, adjacent to the anterior median fissure, but it goes no lower than the upper thoracic part of the cord. The fibers eventually cross to the opposite anterior horn.</p>
<p>The most important extrapyramidal tracts are the reticulospinal and the vestibulospinal tracts. The lateral reticulospinal tract arises from the medullary part of the reticular formation and the fibers run down in the lateral white column, largely intermingled with corticospinal fibers. Its influence on anterior horn cells is facilitatory. The medial reticulospinal tract comes from cells in the pontine reticular formation and descends in the anterior white column, to have an inhibitory action on motor neurons. The lateral vestibulospinal tract arises from the lateral vestibular nucleus of the medulla and runs down the cord approximately through the anterior nerve root region. The reticulo- and vestibulospinal fibers synapse with cells in laminae VII and VIII, in turn projecting to the lamina IX motor neurons. The vestibulospinal tract primarily affects trunk and limb girdle musculature, and is of great importance for posture and balance.</p>
<p>The descending sympathetic tract, whose fibers were seen in the brainstem in the region of the spinal lemniscus, provides a link between the hypothalamus and the thoracolumbar lateral horn cells (lamina VII). In the cord, the fibers have recently been shown to lie where they might be expected, adjacent to the lateral horn. Presumably, similar fibers run to the parasympathetic cells of the sacral lateral horn.</p>
<p>Clinically, it is important to distinguish between upper and lower motor neuron lesions. The lower motor neuron lesion produces a flaccid paralysis of muscles with decreased or absent reflexes. Spastic paralysis with increased reflexes, clonus, and an extensor plantar response (p. 28) is regarded as evidence of an upper motor neuron lesion. However, it should be noted that a pure pyramidal lesion (rare, but possible from a lesion confined to the pyramid of the medulla) produces a flaccid paralysis. The reason why pyramidal lesions induce spasticity is that there is concomitant involvement of extrapyramidal pathways as well; the responsiveness of the α motor neurons is altered, possibly because they have been released from the inhibition normally exerted by supraspinal levels. Since most of the pyramidal tract is intermingled with extrapyramidal fibers, most pyramidal lesions present as spasticity. The up-going toe of the extensor plantar response (p. 28) remains one of the most important signs in clinical medicine and is taken as evidence of an upper motor neuron lesion.</p>
<p>In the brainstem and spinal cord, the motor tracts of each side are quite close together so that a single lesion may easily affect both sides, but in the hemispheres, the tracts of the two sides are much farther apart and so unlikely to be damaged together. The single lesion here that does affect both sides together is a parasagittal meningioma pressing on the leg areas of both hemispheres.</p>
<h2 id="blood-supply-of-the-spinal-cord">
  Blood Supply of the Spinal Cord
  <a class="anchor" href="#blood-supply-of-the-spinal-cord">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The spinal cord is supplied by the (single) anterior and (right and left) posterior spinal arteries which descend from the level of the foramen magnum and form three longitudinal channels from which branches enter the cord. They are supplemented at variable levels by anastomoses with a variable number of radicular arteries.</p>
<p>The anterior spinal artery is a midline vessel that lies on the anterior median fissure (Fig. 7.23). It is formed at the foramen magnum by the union of the anterior spinal branch from each vertebral artery. Although it is usually larger than the posterior spinal arteries and runs the whole length of the cord, the anterior spinal may become so small in places, especially in the thoracic region, that it may be considered absent. It supplies the whole cord anterior to the posterior grey columns, i.e., the lateral grey and white columns and the anterior grey and white columns of both sides.</p>
<p>The posterior spinal artery on each side arises from the posterior inferior cerebellar or vertebral artery at the foramen magnum. It is usually double, forming longitudinal trunks that run through and behind the posterior nerve rootlets for the whole length of the cord. There is some anastomosis between the vessels of the two sides, with rather scanty connections with the anterior spinal artery, except at the lower end of the cord where there are often good anastomoses. The posterior spinal artery supplies the grey and white posterior columns of its own side.</p>
<p>The radicular arteries make highly important contributions to reinforce the longitudinal trunks. At one stage during embryonic development, every segment of the cord receives a radicular vessel on both sides; they enter through the intervertebral foramina as spinal arteries to penetrate the meninges and run along the nerve roots, and are derived from various parent vessels depending on the level - vertebral, costocervical, posterior intercostal, lumbar, lateral sacral. As fetal growth proceeds, most of the radicular arteries disappear. Those that remain form anastomoses with the anterior and posterior spinal arteries, and are commonly called booster or feeder vessels. Their most characteristic feature is their variability in number and position - one or two, or a dozen or more on either side - and incoming blood from them may flow up and/or down the cord. Because of the frequently small size of the longitudinal trunks, considerable lengths of the cord may be largely dependent on the radicular supply. The largest of the feeder vessels, the arteria radicularis magna (of Adamkiewicz), is commonly regarded as being that of the T10 or T11 roots, but although it is slightly commoner at these levels and on the left, it may be anywhere from T7 to L4 level and cannot be relied upon to accompany a low thoracic root. Operations on the vertebral column or adjacent structures (such as aortic aneurysms) that interfere with the parent stems of such radicular vessels may gravely damage the cord.</p>
<p>The anastomotic connections on the surface of the cord (deep to the pia mater) between the anterior and posterior spinal and radicular vessels provide very small pial arteries that are capable of supplying peripheral areas of the cord. This is important with respect to the lateral corticospinal and anterolateral tracts whose fibers are laminated, with sacral fibers lying nearest to the surface. Interference with the anterior spinal supply may eliminate the function of these tracts, except for the sacral fibers which remain supplied by the pial vessels (sacral sparing).</p>
<p>As is usual in the body, even when arterial input is by end arteries, the emerging veins anastomose freely. The spinal veins form loose-knit plexuses anteriorly and posteriorly. On each side, the posterior spinal veins are double, straddling the posterior nerve roots. Both anterior and posterior veins drain along the nerve roots, communicating with the vertebral venous plexuses and (through the intervertebral foramina) with the segmental veins - vertebral in the neck, azygos in the thorax, lumbar in the lumbar region, and lateral sacral in the sacral region. At the foramen magnum, they communicate with the veins of the medulla.</p>
<h2 id="spinal-cord-injury">
  Spinal Cord Injury
  <a class="anchor" href="#spinal-cord-injury">#</a>
</h2>
<p>In complete transection, there is loss of movement and all sensation below the level of the injured segment. The paralysis, which is at first flaccid, becomes spastic after a few weeks, and bladder and rectal sphincter control is lost, although reflex emptying will occur provided the sacral part of the cord is intact. In lesions above T10 segment, there is no effective cough because of abdominal and lower intercostal paralysis. In suspected transection, examination for sensation in the perianal skin will establish whether or not there is conduction throughout the length of the cord. Perianal pinprick will also establish whether the anal reflex is intact (p. 29).</p>
<p>In hemisection (Brown-Séquard syndrome), there is paralysis and loss of touch and kinesthetic sense below the level of the lesion on the same side (lateral corticospinal tract and posterior column interruption), and loss of pain and temperature sensation on the opposite side (because of interruption of the crossed anterolateral tract).</p>
<p>In the central cord syndrome, commonly due to a crush injury (without transection) following a sudden hyperextension of the cervical spine, there is flaccid (lower motor neuron) paralysis and loss of pain and temperature sensation in the upper limbs (due to anterior horn damage and interruption of the more deeply placed cervical fibers of the anterolateral tracts). The lower limbs may show spasticity if the lumbar fibers of the lateral corticospinal tract are involved (the sacral fibers are more superficial).</p>
<p>In the anterior spinal artery syndrome, the posterior white columns (and therefore touch sensation) remain intact, but most of the rest of the cord below the level of the lesion is affected with loss of all motor and sensory functions, except perhaps for the sacral sparing discussed above.</p>
<p>The cranial end of the neural tube (p. 35) becomes dilated into vesicles, and its walls thicken by proliferation of cells; the cerebral hemispheres, brainstem, and cerebellum are so developed. More caudally, the neural tube enlarges in a simple manner by proliferation of cells, to form the spinal cord. In all regions, these proliferating cells arrange themselves regularly in functional groups. Attention is focused here on the development of the nuclei in the brainstem, in order to explain that, despite their apparent random arrangement as seen in cross-sections, there is a logical pattern to their positions that can be correlated with the rather simpler disposition of cell groups in the spinal cord.</p>
<h2 id="spinal-cord-development">
  Spinal Cord Development
  <a class="anchor" href="#spinal-cord-development">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The central canal, relatively very large at first, is not rounded in cross-section, but is projected laterally into a groove on the inner wall of the spinal cord, as the sulcus limitans (Fig. 7.37A). The inner wall of the spinal cord is separated by the sulcus limitans into a dorsal alar lamina and a ventral basal lamina. The alar lamina contains sensory (afferent) cells, and the basal lamina contains motor (efferent) cells. In each lamina, the cells are of two kinds; near the sulcus limitans lie the autonomic (visceral) cells, while further away lie the body wall and limb (somatic) cells (Fig. 7.37A).</p>
<h2 id="brainstem-development">
  Brainstem Development
  <a class="anchor" href="#brainstem-development">#</a>
</h2>
<p>A similar arrangement holds in the brainstem as in the spinal cord. But here a third type of cell appears in each lamina, namely the branchial afferent and efferent cells of cranial nerves supplying the derivatives of the branchial arches (p. 37). These branchial cells theoretically lie between the autonomic and somatic cells of each lamina. They are the central cell stations of the nerves of the pharyngeal arches (trigeminal, facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus). Unfortunately, the branchial group or column is sometimes known as the special visceral group, and must not be confused with the visceral group which, to help in distinguishing the two, should then be called general visceral. It is best to stick to the adjective &ldquo;branchial&rdquo; and so avoid confusion.</p>
<p>In the fourth ventricle, the central canal is opened out, and basal and alar laminae lie roughly in the same plane; the dorsal afferent and ventral efferent cells here become lateral and medial respectively. The order of the cell groups is similar, but migration of certain cell groups (neurobiotaxis) in the developing brainstem alters, in places, the relatively simple basic arrangement.</p>
<p>The motor nuclei are arranged according to the type of muscle they supply (Fig. 7.37B). The ordinary skeletal muscle of the head (somatic muscle) consists of the muscles of the orbit and the muscles of the tongue. In line with the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord, the brainstem nuclei supplying these muscles (oculomotor, trochlear, abducent, and hypoglossal) lie near the midline ventral to the central canal (i.e., ventral to the aqueduct or floor of the fourth ventricle as the case may be).</p>
<p>Developed from the region of the embryonic pharynx are the striated muscles of mastication, of the face, and of the pharynx and larynx. Their motor nuclei (branchial) lie slightly more laterally: the motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, the facial nucleus, and the nucleus ambiguus (for the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves and the cranial part of the accessory nerve).</p>
<p>The visceral or parasympathetic motor nuclei are represented by the accessory oculomotor (Edinger-Westphal) nucleus, the salivary nucleus (whose secretomotor fibers join the nervus intermedius part of the facial nerve and the glossopharyngeal nerve), and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (for cardiac muscle and the smooth muscle of the alimentary tract).</p>
<p>The sensory nuclei follow the general plan outlined above, and from medial to lateral form visceral, branchial, and somatic afferent groups (the reverse order of the motor efferent columns). But unlike the motor groups, which consist of interrupted columns forming individual nuclei, each of these afferent columns consists of only a single nuclear mass (Fig. 7.38). The visceral and branchial afferent cell groups appear to have merged as the nucleus of the tractus solitarius, which receives not only taste (branchial) fibers from the facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves but also many visceral afferents from the heart, lungs, and viscera from the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. (Previously, the dorsal nucleus of the vagus was considered to be a mixed nucleus with afferent cell bodies as well as motor cells, but recent authorities suggest that the vagal nucleus itself is purely motor.) The somatic afferent column is represented by the sensory nuclei of the trigeminal nerve, really one elongated nucleus with different functions at different levels - proprioceptive in the mesencephalic part, touch in the upper pontine part (main sensory nucleus), and pain and temperature in the lower pons and medulla (spinal nucleus). The brainstem has a fourth column of sensory nuclei that has no counterpart in the spinal cord; these are the cochlear and vestibular nuclei of the vestibulocochlear nerve, and they form a special somatic afferent group lying farthest laterally.</p>

<h3 id="olfactory-nerve-i">
  Olfactory Nerve (I)
  <a class="anchor" href="#olfactory-nerve-i">#</a>
</h3>
<p>From the neuroepithelium in the upper part of the nose, trace the two neurons to the olfactory cortex. The first neurons are scattered bipolar cells in the neuroepithelium - a unique occurrence. Their central processes gather themselves into nearly 20 olfactory nerve filaments that pass through foramina in the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone and here pierce the dura and arachnoid mater of the anterior cranial fossa. They enter the olfactory bulb to synapse on the mitral cells (second neuron) whose central processes pass in the olfactory tract to the region of the anterior perforated substance and the uncus (p. 581). The arrangement is unique and primitive: the second order neuron directly activates the conscious cortex, bypassing the thalamus. Other olfactory pathways, by polysynaptic junctions, activate hypothalamic and brainstem nuclei (as is the case with all sensory pathways) for visceral and somatic effects, distinct from conscious appreciation.</p>
<h3 id="optic-nerve-ii">
  Optic Nerve (II)
  <a class="anchor" href="#optic-nerve-ii">#</a>
</h3>
<p>From the neuroepithelium in the retina, trace the neurons centrally. The rods and cones, near the choroidal surface of the retina, activate the bipolar cells of the retina; these are the first sensory neurons. Their central processes synapse on the large ganglion cells that lie scattered on the vitreous surface of the retina. The central processes of these second neurons form the optic nerve fibers; they converge to the optic disc and enter the dura and arachnoid mater there. They pass in the optic nerve up to the chiasma where the nasal fibers from each retina decussate. From the chiasma, the optic tract passes around the midbrain (cerebral peduncle) to three destinations: (1) the lateral geniculate body (thalamus) for relay to the visual cortex, (2) the pretectal nuclei for pupil constriction to light, and (3) the superior colliculus for body reflexes to light.</p>
<p>The visual pathway is that part of the optic tract which reaches the lateral geniculate body of the thalamus (Fig. 7.8). Here the temporal fibers relay on layers 2, 3, and 5 while the crossed nasal fibers do so on layers 1, 4, and 6. From the lateral geniculate body, fibers of the third neurons pass through the retrolentiform part of the internal capsule and backwards by the optic radiation to the visual (striate) cortex on the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere (p. 587). In the visual cortex, the macula is represented posteriorly. More peripheral parts of the retina register more anteriorly.</p>
<p>The pupillary light reflex and the accommodation-convergence reflex are described on page 518, and general light reflexes on page 588.</p>
<h3 id="oculomotor-nerve-iii">
  Oculomotor Nerve (III)
  <a class="anchor" href="#oculomotor-nerve-iii">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The oculomotor nucleus lies in the midbrain at the level of the superior colliculi, near the midline, in the grey matter in the floor of the aqueduct. It is somatic (motor to striated ocular muscles) and visceral (motor to smooth muscle in the eye), and this latter, the Edinger-Westphal or accessory oculomotor nucleus, lies cranial to the somatic nucleus. The fibers (about 24,000) traverse the brainstem with a lateral convexity, passing through the red nucleus and the substantia nigra (Fig. 7.25).</p>
<p>The nerve is attached to the medial surface of the base of the cerebral peduncle near the midline, just above the pons. The nerve is straight and has a gentle downward slope. It passes forwards between the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar branches of the basilar artery, then below and lateral to the posterior communicating artery and just below the free margin of the tentorium cerebelli, traversing the interpeduncular cistern below the floor of the third ventricle (Fig. 7.23). Lying below the optic tract, it pierces arachnoid and dura mater of the roof of the cavernous sinus just behind the upward bend of the internal carotid artery (Fig. 6.47, p. 510).</p>
<p>Still straight and sloping downwards, it is attached to the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus above the abducent nerve. It slants down medial to the trochlear nerve and the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal (Fig. 6.93, p. 565). It picks up some sympathetic fibers that peel off the internal carotid plexus - these are for the smooth-muscle part of levator palpebrae superioris. At the anterior pole of the cavernous sinus, it splits into a superior and an inferior division and immediately enters the tendinous ring at the medial end of the superior orbital fissure. This takes it inside the cone of ocular muscles, with the nasociliary nerve between its divisions and the abducent nerve below it (Fig. 6.20, p. 470).</p>
<p>The superior division passes up to enter the ocular surface of superior rectus one-third of the way along. It supplies this muscle and passes on to levator palpebrae superioris. The sympathetic fibers supply the visceral muscle part of levator (their loss accounts for the partial ptosis characteristic of Horner&rsquo;s syndrome - p. 519).</p>
<p>The inferior division breaks up quickly into three branches. One supplies medial rectus and another inferior rectus; each of these enters the ocular surface of its muscle one-third of the way along. The third branch, longer, is the nerve to the inferior oblique and passes forwards into the ocular surface of that muscle (Fig. 6.93, p. 565). All the Edinger-Westphal fibers are in the proximal part of this branch. They leave it to enter the ciliary ganglion, where they relay. The cell bodies of the ciliary ganglion supply, through the short ciliary nerves, the sphincter pupillae (for pupil constriction) and the ciliary muscle (for accommodation). Some afferent fibers (passing through the ganglion without relay) supply the cornea.</p>
<h3 id="trochlear-nerve-iv">
  Trochlear Nerve (IV)
  <a class="anchor" href="#trochlear-nerve-iv">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The nucleus is in the midbrain at the level of the inferior colliculi. It is somatic (for the superior oblique muscle) and lies near the midline in the floor of the aqueduct (Fig. 7.26). The fibers (about 3,400) decussate completely dorsal to the aqueduct. This is unique, but the significance is not understood.</p>
<p>The nerve emerges dorsally near the midline behind the inferior colliculus through the apex of the superior medullary velum (Fig. 7.24). Thence it passes around the midbrain just below the free edge of the tentorium cerebelli and runs between the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries (Fig. 7.23). Clinging to the undersurface of the free edge of the tentorium cerebelli, it is directed thereby to the roof of the cavernous sinus, piercing the arachnoid and dura (behind the oculomotor nerve) where the free and attached margins of the tentorium cross. Running forwards in the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus below the third nerve, it is then crossed medially by it and so becomes the uppermost nerve in the anterior end of the sinus. It enters the superior orbital fissure lateral to the tendinous ring and passes over levator palpebrae superioris to enter the orbital surface of the superior oblique one-third of the way along the muscle (Fig. 6.47A, p. 510).</p>
<h3 id="trigeminal-nerve-v">
  Trigeminal Nerve (V)
  <a class="anchor" href="#trigeminal-nerve-v">#</a>
</h3>
<p>This is both motor and sensory. The motor nucleus is in the upper pons (Fig. 7.27). It is branchial, for the muscles of the first branchial arch. It is thus off center, and lies deep beneath the floor of the fourth ventricle. The sensory nucleus is divided into three functionally different parts, but all somatic, extending in continuity throughout the whole length of the brainstem and descending into the upper two or three segments of the spinal cord. The mesencephalic nucleus extends through the whole length of the midbrain, wherein it lies lateral to the aqueduct, in the central grey matter. It is unique in that its cell bodies are those of the first order neurons; their peripheral processes have passed straight through the trigeminal ganglion. They mediate proprioceptive impulses from the fifth nerve muscles and also from those supplied by the oculomotor, trochlear, abducent, and facial nerves and (probably) the hypoglossal nerve. The main sensory nucleus is in the upper pons lateral to the motor nucleus and ventral to the superior cerebellar peduncle. It consists of second order cell bodies which mediate sensations of touch from the whole trigeminal territory via the first order neurons whose cell bodies are in the trigeminal ganglion. The spinal nucleus is the name given to the column of second order cell bodies that extends from the lower pons through the whole medulla, becoming continuous at the lower end with the gelatinous substance of the spinal cord as far as the third cervical segment. It mediates pain and temperature sensations. Although it is usually stated that pain fibers register in this nucleus in an upside-down manner, with the fibers from the ophthalmic division synapsing with cells in the lowest part, those of the mandibular division going to the uppermost part and maxillary fibers in between, clinical observations indicate that the projection to the nucleus is from an onion-skin pattern of facial supply, working backwards from the mouth (Fig. 6.13B, p. 451).</p>
<p>The fibers that reach the main sensory and spinal nuclei come from cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglion. Together with the direct fibers that reach the mesencephalic nucleus, they form a single, large, sensory root attached to the pons, well lateral and just above center. The motor root emerges separately, slightly cranial and medial to its companion (Fig. 7.22, p. 604). Together they pass, below the tentorium cerebelli, to the mouth of the trigeminal cave (Fig. 6.94, p. 566). This is a tubular prolongation of arachnoid-lined fibrous dura mater around the sensory and motor roots, and it crosses the upper border of the petrous bone near its apex, i.e., it passes from the posterior into the middle cranial fossa. The dural sheath containing the two nerve roots passes forwards, peeling apart the two layers of dura that floor the middle cranial fossa, just lateral to where the same two layers peel apart to enclose the cavernous sinus. The sensory root then expands into the large, flat, crescentic trigeminal ganglion; the motor root remains separate. The dural sheath obliterates the subarachnoid space by fusing with the pia mater halfway along the ganglion; this is the anterior extremity of the trigeminal cave (Fig. 6.93, p. 565). The posterior half of the ganglion and both roots are thus bathed in cerebrospinal fluid. The anterior half of the ganglion, beyond the subarachnoid space, gives off its three sensory divisions, ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular. The first two pass forwards in the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus; they are wholly sensory. The mandibular division, likewise sensory, passes straight down from the lower part of the ganglion to the foramen ovale; here it is joined by the motor root.</p>
<h4 id="ophthalmic-nerve">
  Ophthalmic Nerve
  <a class="anchor" href="#ophthalmic-nerve">#</a>
</h4>
<p>This is the nerve of the frontonasal process (p. 41 and Fig. 1.37, p. 42). Leaving the upper part of the ganglion, the ophthalmic division runs forward in the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus below the trochlear nerve. Here it picks up sympathetic fibers from the cavernous plexus; these are for the dilator pupillae muscle. At the anterior end of the cavernous sinus, it gives off meningeal branches, the tentorial nerves, which supply all the supratentorial dura mater except that in the bony floor of the middle cranial fossa. Finally, it breaks into three branches that pass through the superior orbital fissure: the lacrimal, frontal, and nasociliary nerves (Fig. 6.93, p. 565; Fig. 6.20, p. 470).</p>
<p>The lacrimal nerve, passing lateral to the tendinous ring, proceeds along the upper part of the lateral wall of the orbit, there picking up a secretomotor branch from the zygomatic nerve which it gives to the lacrimal gland. It is sensory to a fingertip area of skin at the lateral end of the upper eyelid (Fig. 6.13A, p. 451) and to both palpebral and ocular surfaces of the corresponding conjunctiva.</p>
<p>The frontal nerve leaves the cavernous sinus to traverse the superior orbital fissure just lateral to the tendinous ring, bunched together between the lacrimal and trochlear nerves. A large nerve, it runs forward in contact with orbital periosteum above levator palpebrae superioris (Fig. 6.47A, p. 510). Just behind the superior orbital margin, it divides into a large supraorbital and a small supratrochlear branch (Fig. 6.13A, p. 451). The supraorbital nerve supplies the frontal sinus, notches or perforates the orbital margin, supplies the upper eyelid (skin and both surfaces of conjunctiva), all the forehead except a central strip, and the frontal scalp up to the vertex. The supratrochlear nerve supplies the upper lid and conjunctiva and a narrow strip of forehead skin alongside the midline. It scarcely extends beyond the hairline, where the two supraorbital nerves meet each other.</p>
<p>The nasociliary nerve is sensory to the whole eyeball, to the paranasal sinuses along the medial wall of the orbit, to some mucous membrane of the nasal cavity, and to the skin of the external nose. It carries hitchhiking sympathetic fibers for the dilator pupillae muscle and changes its name twice, first to anterior ethmoidal and then to external nasal.</p>
<p>The nerve leaves the cavernous sinus and enters the tendinous ring between the two divisions of the oculomotor nerve. It passes straight forwards into the cone of muscles above the optic nerve and along the medial wall of the orbit, below the superior oblique and above the medial rectus. It then passes into the anterior ethmoidal foramen, so becoming the anterior ethmoidal nerve (Fig. 6.19, p. 468). Running obliquely forwards, it is in the roof of the middle and anterior ethmoidal air cells, supplying their mucous membranes. It passes on to the cribriform plate, between the two layers of dura (Fig. 6.89, p. 561), thus making a very brief appearance in the anterior cranial fossa, and descends through the slit alongside the crista galli into the roof of the nose. It straddles the nose, supplying the anterosuperior quadrant of the lateral wall and the anterosuperior half of the nasal septum. It then continues as the external nasal nerve, to notch the nasal bone and supply the skin over the external nasal cartilages, down to the tip of the nose.</p>
<p>The infratrochlear nerve branches off the nasociliary just before the latter enters the anterior ethmoidal foramen, and continues forward below the trochlea of the superior oblique tendon, supplies skin and conjunctiva of the medial end of the upper eyelid and ends on the skin over the bridge of the nose.</p>
<p>The posterior ethmoidal nerve branches off the nasociliary proximal to the infratrochlear nerve, enters the posterior ethmoidal foramen and supplies the posterior ethmoidal air cells and the adjacent sphenoidal sinus. It does not reach the nasal cavity, and is often very small or even absent.</p>
<p>Near the back of the orbit, the nasociliary nerve gives off the communicating branch to the ciliary ganglion (Fig. 6.93, p. 565) and the long ciliary nerves. The communicating branch is the sensory root of the ganglion; its fibers pass through the ganglion and via the 8-10 short ciliary nerves (which are branches from the ganglion also conveying postganglionic parasympathetic fibers to the ciliary muscle and sphincter pupillae) to provide sensory fibers to the eye including the cornea (but not the conjunctiva). The long ciliary nerves, usually two, run forward to enter the sclera independently. They carry sympathetic fibers (picked up by the ophthalmic nerve in the cavernous sinus) to the dilator pupillae muscle and (like the short ciliary nerves) are also sensory to the eye, including the cornea (but not the conjunctiva).</p>
<h4 id="maxillary-nerve">
  Maxillary Nerve
  <a class="anchor" href="#maxillary-nerve">#</a>
</h4>
<p>This is the nerve of the maxillary process that differentiates from the first pharyngeal arch (p. 38). Leaving the middle part of the trigeminal ganglion, the nerve runs forward in the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus below the ophthalmic nerve. The lateral wall here fuses with the outer layer of dura mater at the lateral margin of the foramen rotundum, and so the maxillary nerve is directed through the foramen into the upper part of the pterygopalatine fossa (Fig. 6.93, p. 565). It has a short course, below the roof of the fossa, to the inferior orbital fissure where it turns laterally for a centimeter or so, becoming the infraorbital nerve which enters the infraorbital groove and canal, finally emerging on the face through the infraorbital foramen.</p>
<p>Among the most important structures supplied by the nerve are the nasal mucosa, palate, upper teeth, lacrimal gland, and the skin of the face between the eye and mouth.</p>
<p>A small meningeal branch (middle meningeal nerve) supplies the dura mater of the anterior half of the middle cranial fossa.</p>
<p>The ganglionic branches form the connection between the maxillary nerve and the pterygopalatine ganglion (Fig. 6.19, p. 468); despite the official plural, the connection is a single stout trunk that passes downwards and medially to the ganglion. Most of the fibers of the trunk pass through the ganglion into its branches, where they mingle with the postganglionic fibers of the greater petrosal and deep petrosal nerves (i.e., fibers of the nerve of the pterygoid canal - p. 468).</p>
<p>The branches of the ganglion (which are not the same as the ganglionic branches) can be classified as nasal (nasopalatine and posterior superior nasal), palatine (greater and lesser), pharyngeal, and orbital according to their destination.</p>
<p>The nasopalatine nerve (long sphenopalatine) enters the sphenopalatine foramen, crosses the roof of the nose and slopes down along the nasal septum, supplying its posteroinferior half. It goes through the incisive canal and fossa into the hard palate and supplies the gum behind the two incisor teeth.</p>
<p>The greater palatine nerve runs down in the greater palatine canal, between the perpendicular plate of the palatine bone and the body of the maxilla (Fig. 6.18, p. 567). Multiple branches supply the posteroinferior quadrant of the lateral wall of the nose and the adjacent floor of the nose; others supply the maxillary sinus nearby. The nerve emerges from the greater palatine foramen and supplies all the hard palate except the incisor gum.</p>
<p>The pharyngeal branch passes back through the palatovaginal canal to supply the mucous membrane of the nasopharynx down to the level of the opening of the auditory tube and possibly part of the tubal mucosa.</p>
<p>The zygomatic nerve arises from the maxillary in the pterygopalatine fossa. It enters the inferior orbital fissure and runs along the lower part of the lateral wall of the orbit. It carries the postganglionic secretomotor fibers for the lacrimal gland. These leave the zygomatic nerve and go up the lateral wall of the orbit to join the lacrimal nerve. The zygomatic nerve itself enters the zygomatic bone and there divides into two branches. The zygomaticofacial nerve perforates the facial surface of the zygomatic bone and supplies the skin over the bone. The zygomaticotemporal nerve perforates the temporal surface of the zygomatic bone, pierces the temporalis fascia, and supplies skin above the zygomatic arch (the hairless skin of the temple Fig. 6.13A, p. 451).</p>
<p>The posterior superior alveolar nerve (posterior superior dental) begins as a single branch of the maxillary in the pterygopalatine fossa but quickly divides into three which emerge through the pterygomaxillary fissure. Two enter the posterior wall of the maxilla above the tuberosity. They supply mucous membrane of the maxillary sinus and the three molar teeth (except the anterior buccal root of the first molar). The third stays outside the maxilla, pierces the buccinator, and supplies the gum of the vestibule alongside the three molar teeth.</p>
<p>The infraorbital nerve, the changed name of the maxillary when in the inferior orbital fissure, passes forward along the floor of the orbit, sinks into a groove, then enters a canal and emerges on the face through the infraorbital foramen. It supplies multiple small branches through the orbital surface of the maxilla to the maxillary sinus. In the infraorbital groove, it gives off the middle superior alveolar nerve. This runs down, supplying adjacent mucosa of the maxillary sinus, to supply the two premolar teeth and the anterior buccal root of the first molar. The infraorbital nerve gives off, in the infraorbital canal, the anterior superior alveolar nerve (Fig. 6.23, p. 475). This goes lateral, then turns inferior, to the infraorbital canal, supplies the maxillary sinus, the canine and the two incisors, and reaches the anterior inferior quadrant of the lateral wall of the nose (including the nasolacrimal duct) and the adjacent floor of the nose. It ends on the nasal septum.</p>
<p>Emerging on the face, the infraorbital nerve lies between levator labii superioris and levator anguli oris. It has many communications with local branches of the facial nerve; these are for the proprioceptive supply of the nearby facial muscles. It is distributed in three groups of branches (Fig. 6.13A, p. 451). The palpebral branches supply the skin of the lower lid and both surfaces of the conjunctiva. The nasal branches supply a small strip of skin along the external nose. The labial branches supply the skin and mucous membrane of the whole upper lip and also the adjacent gum: that is, from the midline to include the gum of the second premolar tooth.</p>
<h4 id="mandibular-nerve">
  Mandibular Nerve
  <a class="anchor" href="#mandibular-nerve">#</a>
</h4>
<p>This is the nerve of the first (mandibular) pharyngeal arch. It is a very short nerve, soon dividing into a sheaf of branches. Leaving the inferior part of the ganglion, it passes down to the foramen ovale (Fig. 6.89, p. 561). It is accompanied by the small motor root of the trigeminal nerve which passes beneath the ganglion and joins the sensory root at the foramen ovale. The mixed nerve then passes from the foramen into the infratemporal fossa, between the upper head of the lateral pterygoid and tensor palati (which lies on the side wall of the nasopharynx). After 4 or 5 mm, the nerve divides into a cat of nine tails. These branches consist of an anterior group (all motor except one) and a posterior group (all sensory except one small branch).</p>
<p>There are two branches from the short trunk before it breaks up. A meningeal branch (nervus spinosus) passes up through the foramen ovale (sometimes through the foramen spinosum); here it supplies the cartilaginous part of the auditory tube. In the middle fossa, it supplies the dura mater in the posterior half thereof, then passes between the squamous and petrous parts of the temporal bone to supply the mastoid antrum and the mastoid air cells that extend from it. It is the nerve of the first pharyngeal pouch.</p>
<p>The nerve to the medial pterygoid sinks into the deep surface of the muscle. It has a branch that passes close to the otic ganglion and supplies the two tensor muscles, tensor palati and tensor tympani.</p>
<p><strong>Anterior branches.</strong> The anterior leash of branches consists of the following six:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two nerves to the lateral pterygoid, one to each head.</li>
<li>Two deep temporal nerves. These pass above the upper head of the lateral pterygoid, turn above the infratemporal crest, and sink into the deep surface of temporalis.</li>
<li>The nerve to masseter likewise passes above the upper head of the lateral pterygoid, proceeds laterally behind temporalis and through the mandibular notch to sink into masseter. It gives a branch to the mandibular joint (Hilton&rsquo;s law).</li>
<li>The buccal nerve is the only sensory branch of the anterior group and is the only nerve to pass between the two heads of the lateral pterygoid. It carries sometimes a middle temporal nerve that enters the deep surface of temporalis. The buccal nerve passes down, deep to temporalis, on the lower head of lateral pterygoid. It reaches the buccinator (Fig. 6.15, p. 458), and gives off here a cutaneous branch which supplies a thumb-print area of skin over the soft cheek immediately below the zygomatic bone (Fig. 6.13A, p. 451). The nerve then pierces the buccinator and supplies the mucous membrane adherent to the deep surface of the muscle and ends by supplying the vestibular gum of the three mandibular molar teeth. The buccal nerve carries secretomotor fibers from the otic ganglion; they are for the molar and buccal glands.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Posterior branches.</strong> The posterior branches are three in number, and are all sensory except the mylohyoid branch of the inferior alveolar nerve.</p>
<ul>
<li>The auriculotemporal nerve has two roots that pass back around the middle meningeal artery. The nerve picks up postganglionic secretomotor fibers from the otic ganglion; these are for the parotid gland. It passes back deep to the neck of the mandible, and gives the major sensory supply to the mandibular joint. Curving around the neck of the mandible, it supplies the parotid gland with sensory fibers and the secretomotor fibers it picked up from the otic ganglion. The nerve now divides into its terminal branches. The auricular branch supplies the external acoustic meatus and the external surface of the auricle above this. The temporal branch runs up over the root of the zygomatic process of the temporal bone, behind the superficial temporal vessels, and supplies the hairy skin of the scalp (the hair that first turns grey).</li>
<li>The inferior alveolar nerve (inferior dental) passes down deep to the lower head of the lateral pterygoid (Fig. 6.15, p. 458), and lies on the medial pterygoid between the mandible and the sphenomandibular ligament. It enters the mandibular foramen in front of the inferior alveolar artery and vein. Here it gives off the nerve to mylohyoid. This is the only motor part of the posterior branches of the mandibular nerve; it pierces the sphenomandibular ligament, lies in the gutter between the ramus and the medial pterygoid, then lies on the mylohyoid groove made by its accompanying small vessels (Fig. 6.26, p. 486). The mylohyoid nerve passes forwards down into the neck (i.e., below mylohyoid muscle) and runs between mylohyoid and the anterior belly of the digastric, supplying both these muscles. It is accompanied here by the submental branches of the facial artery and vein.</li>
<li>The inferior alveolar nerve runs forwards in the mandibular canal and supplies the posterior five teeth (three molars and two premolars). Then it divides into its two terminal branches. The incisive branch goes on to supply the remaining three teeth (canine and both incisors) and overlaps to the opposite central incisor. The mental nerve passes from the mental foramen to supply the lower lip (both surfaces) and the adjacent gum, which is from the midline to include the second premolar gum. It carries a few fibers from the otic ganglion to the labial glands of the lower lip.</li>
<li>The lingual nerve is joined by the chorda tympani about 2 cm below the base of the skull, deep to the lower border of the lateral pterygoid muscle. It curves down on the medial pterygoid about 1 cm in front of the inferior alveolar nerve (Fig. 6.15, p. 458). It then passes under the free lower border of the superior constrictor and goes forward above the mylohyoid muscle (i.e., in the mouth). It grooves the lingual plate of the mandible just below the last molar tooth, and here gives off a gingival branch that supplies the lingual gum to the midline (Fig. 6.26, p. 486). Dipping now below the submandibular duct (Fig. 6.17, p. 465), it ascends on hyoglossus to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, which it supplies with common sensation and taste, the latter mediated by the chorda tympani fibers. The secretomotor fibers of the chorda tympani (nervus intermedius) are given off to the submandibular ganglion, where they relay to the salivary glands in the floor of the mouth cavity. The lingual nerve and no other supplies all the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth.</li>

<h3 id="abducent-nerve-vi">
  Abducent Nerve (VI)
  <a class="anchor" href="#abducent-nerve-vi">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The abducent nucleus is in the lower pons (Fig. 7.28). It is somatic and lies near the midline of the fourth ventricle with fibers of the facial nerve overlying it to produce the bulge known as the facial colliculus (Fig. 7.24). The nerve (with about 6,600 fibers) emerges at the lower border of the pons, above the pyramid of the medulla (Fig. 7.22). It enters the pontine cistern and turns upwards, between the anterior inferior cerebellar artery and the pons, to pierce the arachnoid and dura mater on the clivus, above the level of the jugular tubercle (Fig. 6.89, p. 561). Running up now between the two layers of the dura, it enters the inferior petrosal sinus at the apex of the petrous temporal bone (Fig. 6.94, p. 566). Here it bends forwards under the petroclinoid ligament to enter the cavernous sinus. It passes straight forwards in the sinus, lateral to the S-bend of the internal carotid artery, and reaches the medial end of the superior orbital fissure. It enters the tendinous ring below the inferior division of the oculomotor nerve (Fig. 6.20, p. 470). In the orbit, it passes within the cone of muscles to enter the ocular surface of the lateral rectus one-third of the way along the muscle (Fig. 6.47A, p. 510).</p>
<h3 id="facial-nerve-vii">
  Facial Nerve (VII)
  <a class="anchor" href="#facial-nerve-vii">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The facial nerve should perhaps be called the intermediatofacial nerve, to emphasize that the nervus intermedius is classified as part of it. The name &ldquo;sensory root of the facial nerve&rdquo; often applied to the nervus intermedius is not entirely appropriate since the root contains visceral efferent fibers as well as afferents. The term &ldquo;facial nerve&rdquo; will no doubt persist because of long usage and the clumsiness of the adjective that might replace it.</p>
<p>The principal component of the facial nerve is the bundle of branchial motor fibers supplying muscles derived from the second pharyngeal arch (and sometimes called the motor root). There are also visceral efferent fibers for the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands, lacrimal gland, and glands of the nose, palate, and pharynx; visceral afferent fibers from taste buds in the anterior part of the tongue and the soft palate; and a small somatic afferent component from the skin of the external acoustic meatus and tympanic membrane.</p>
<p>The facial nucleus containing the branchial efferent cell bodies is deeply situated in the reticular formation of the lower pons (Fig. 7.28). The fibers (about 7,000) approach the floor of the fourth ventricle and make a knee-bend on the surface of the abducent nucleus at the facial colliculus, but it is the abducent nucleus deep to them that is responsible for the little hillock. The facial nerve traverses the pons and emerges at its lower border above the olive as the main part (motor root) of the facial nerve (Fig. 7.22, p. 604). The visceral motor (secretomotor) nucleus of the nervus intermedius part is the superior salivary nucleus, part of the visceral efferent column and situated adjacent to the (branchial) facial nucleus. The sensory nucleus is the nucleus of the tractus solitarius which lies further laterally but mostly in the medulla: it receives the central processes of the taste cell bodies of the geniculate ganglion, but the few sensory fibers from the skin of the external ear whose cell bodies are also in the ganglion pass to trigeminal nuclei.</p>
<p>The nervus intermedius passes through the pons and emerges at its lower border, between the pons and the inferior cerebellar peduncle, near the vestibulocochlear nerve (Fig. 7.22). With the main part of the facial nerve, it passes laterally in the cerebellopontine angle through the pontine cistern and, with the eighth nerve, they enter the internal acoustic meatus. In the meatus, the main part of the facial nerve lies on the upper surface of the eighth nerve, with the nervus intermedius in between. The whole facial nerve passes into the anterosuperior quadrant of the meatus (Fig. 6.95, p. 572). Running laterally in the petrous bone, above the vestibule of the internal ear, the two parts of the nerve share a common tube of arachnoid and dura mater. The meninges then fuse with the nerves to make a single trunk, and near the middle ear, the nerve makes a sharp posterior bend, the geniculum, which becomes distended due to the presence here of the cells that form the geniculate ganglion - the cell bodies of the afferent fibers (Fig. 6.18, p. 467).</p>
<p>The combined nerve runs back in the medial wall of the middle ear, above the promontory and just below the bulge of the lateral semicircular canal. It now curves downwards behind the middle ear, deep to the aditus to the antrum, and passes vertically down the facial canal. After shedding all the hitchhiking nervus intermedius fibers, the nerve emerges from the stylomastoid foramen, now a purely branchial motor nerve. The face muscles supplied by the facial nerve receive their proprioceptive supply from the cutaneous nerves of the overlying skin (trigeminal nerve branches).</p>
<p>The intracranial branches of the facial nerve that arise within the petrous bone include the greater petrosal nerve, tympanic branches, the nerve to stapedius, and the chorda tympani.</p>
<p>The greater petrosal nerve is a branch of the nervus intermedius, and its greatest importance lies in the fact that it can be said to be the nerve of tear secretion. It is also secretomotor to glands of the palate, pharynx, and nose, and has a few taste fibers for the scattered taste buds on the oral surface of the palate. The cell bodies of the taste fibers are in the geniculate ganglion. The greater petrosal nerve leaves the ganglion and travels forwards and medially at a 45° slant through the petrous bone (Fig. 6.18, p. 467). It emerges and slants forwards in a groove on the petrous bone, between the two layers of the dura mater. Here in the middle cranial fossa, it may be pulled on in extradural operations and so cause small hemorrhage or edema at the geniculate ganglion with consequent pressure on the facial nerve and a temporary facial paresis. The nerve passes beneath the trigeminal ganglion in Meckel&rsquo;s cave and reaches the foramen lacerum. Here it is joined by the deep petrosal nerve (Fig. 6.19, p. 468), which peels off from the sympathetic plexus on the internal carotid artery (the cell bodies of the deep petrosal nerve are in the superior cervical ganglion). The two join and pass forwards through the pterygoid canal. The nerve of the pterygoid canal emerges into the pterygopalatine fossa and enters the pterygopalatine ganglion. Here the secretomotor fibers relay. The taste fibers and the sympathetic fibers pass straight through the ganglion, together with the sensory fibers of the maxillary nerve. Joined by postganglionic secretomotor fibers, they innervate the five territories of the ganglion (nasal septum, lateral nasal wall, paranasal sinuses, hard and soft palates, and the nasopharynx). Lacrimatory postganglionic fibers join the maxillary nerve and enter the orbit in its zygomatic branch (p. 633). They pass up the lateral wall of the orbit to join the lacrimal nerve (from the ophthalmic) and so reach the lacrimal gland.</p>
<p>The small tympanic branches are sensory, joining the tympanic plexus (p. 592) in the mucous membrane of the middle ear. Some traverse the tympanic membrane and trespass into auriculotemporal nerve territory on the skin of the external acoustic meatus and pinna. Their chief interest is that their cell bodies are in the geniculate ganglion and, when this is afflicted by herpes, vesicles appear in the area supplied, including the tympanic membrane.</p>
<p>The chorda tympani is secretomotor for the salivary glands in the floor of the oral cavity, and also carries the taste fibers for the anterior part of the tongue. All its fibers belong to the nervus intermedius part of the nerve. It leaves the facial nerve in the facial canal 6 mm above the stylomastoid foramen and passes through the posterior wall of the middle ear (Fig. 6.18, p. 467). It is draped over by the mucous membrane as it passes across the pars flaccida of the tympanic membrane and the neck of the malleus. It leaves through the anterior wall of the middle ear, passes through the petrous bone, and emerges at the medial end of the petrotympanic fissure. Passing down deep to the spine of the sphenoid, which it grooves on its medial side, the nerve slopes forwards to join the lingual nerve just above the lower border of the lateral pterygoid muscle, about 2 cm beneath the skull. By the lingual nerve, its taste fibers are taken to the anterior part of the tongue. Its secretomotor fibers relay in the submandibular ganglion and pass to the glands in the floor of the mouth cavity.</p>
<p>The extracranial branches include the posterior auricular nerve (for the occipital belly of occipitofrontalis), the nerves to the posterior belly of digastric and stylohyoid, and the five groups of branches for the facial muscles and platysma (p. 449).</p>
<h3 id="vestibulocochlear-nerve-viii">
  Vestibulocochlear Nerve (VIII)
  <a class="anchor" href="#vestibulocochlear-nerve-viii">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The nerve is wholly sensory (special somatic) for sound reception and balance; thus, the nuclei lie in the lateral part of the brainstem, in the medulla and encroaching on the pons. It is logical and convenient to trace the nerve from the periphery to its brainstem nuclei, as in studying the first and second cranial nerves (the diffuse peripheral distribution of the sensory fibers in the trigeminal, glossopharyngeal, and vagus nerves makes it imperative to trace them in the reverse direction, from the nucleus to the periphery). There are two quite distinct parts of the eighth nerve. From fishes to man, sound reception and balance are combined in the one sensory organ (but with quite separate receptors) and in a single cranial nerve; it is a mystery why this should be, or what connection (if any) sound reception has with balance.</p>
<h4 id="cochlear-nerve">
  Cochlear Nerve
  <a class="anchor" href="#cochlear-nerve">#</a>
</h4>
<p>The neuroepithelium for sound reception consists of the hair cells of the spiral organ. The first sensory neuron is bipolar with the cell body in the base of the bony spiral lamina. The cell bodies thus lying in a spiral line are together referred to as the spiral or cochlear ganglion. Their central processes run along the modiolus of the cochlea and join into many small nerves that pierce dura and arachnoid mater at the base of the modiolus in a spiral pattern (Fig. 6.64, p. 533). This is at the anteroinferior quadrant of the internal acoustic meatus (Fig. 6.95, p. 572). They join together in the subarachnoid space and enter the pontine cistern joined with the vestibular part. The nervus intermedius and the main part of the facial nerve lie in front (Fig. 6.96, p. 573). Together these three pass through the cerebellopontine angle in front of the flocculus of the cerebellum and the lateral aperture of the fourth ventricle (Fig. 7.22). The eighth nerve (cochlear and vestibular parts bound together) enters the inferior cerebellar peduncle at the lower border of the pons.</p>
<p>The cochlear fibers (about 30,000) relay in the dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei in the inferior cerebellar peduncle. These second order cell bodies send their central processes to cross in the lower pons and turn up as they cross the medial lemniscus, here forming the trapezoid body to ascend as the lateral lemniscus. Some fibers do not cross but run in the lateral lemniscus of their own side; cochlear representation is largely bilateral. The lateral lemniscus ascends through the tegmentum of the midbrain and some of its fibers relay in the inferior colliculus (for reflex effects of sound). Tectobulbar and tectospinal tracts activate motor nuclei for head and neck and for body and limb reflex movements (compare with light reflex relay in the superior colliculus). The remainder of the lateral lemniscus relays in the medial geniculate body (for hearing). This body, though anatomically in the midbrain, is a displaced thalamic nucleus. From here, the cell bodies send their processes into the sublentiform part of the internal capsule, forming the auditory radiation which passes to the auditory area of the cortex below and within the lateral sulcus (p. 586).</p>
<h4 id="vestibular-nerve">
  Vestibular Nerve
  <a class="anchor" href="#vestibular-nerve">#</a>
</h4>
<p>The neuroepithelium consists of the hair cells in the maculae of utricle and saccule (for static balance) and the ampullae of the semicircular ducts (for kinetic balance). The first neurons emerge from the fundus of the internal acoustic meatus, above and below the horizontal crest (Fig. 6.95, p. 572). From the posterosuperior quadrant of the fundus emerges the nerve from anterior and lateral semicircular ducts and the utricle into which they open (Fig. 6.65, p. 533). Through the posteroinferior quadrant comes the lower division of the vestibular nerve, from the saccule. Alongside it, through the foramen singulare, emerges the nerve from the ampulla of the posterior semicircular duct. Having pierced the fibrous dura and arachnoid mater, the upper and lower divisions lie in the internal acoustic meatus (Fig. 6.64, p. 533) and are here distended into vestibular ganglia by the cell bodies of these first order neurons. The central processes combine into the vestibular nerve (about 18,000 fibers). This joins the cochlear nerve and passes into the pontine cistern. The vestibular fibers relay in the vestibular nuclei, lateral and medial, superior and inferior, in the lateral angle of the fourth ventricle (Fig. 7.28), in both pons and medulla. The nuclei send fibers to the archaeocerebellum and, by the medial longitudinal bundle, to the motor nuclei of the brainstem. The vestibulospinal tract descends from the lateral vestibular nucleus to anterior horn cells, and is one of the most important extrapyramidal tracts. There appear to be cortical connections from the vestibular nuclei, by way of bilateral thalamic relay (i.e., medial geniculate body), to the region of the auditory cortex.</p>
<h3 id="glossopharyngeal-nerve-ix">
  Glossopharyngeal Nerve (IX)
  <a class="anchor" href="#glossopharyngeal-nerve-ix">#</a>
</h3>
<p>This is the nerve of the third branchial arch, with nuclei in the medulla and lowest part of the pons (Fig. 7.38). It is visceral as well as branchial, and mixed sensory and motor (i.e., secretomotor). The small number of branchial motor fibers come from the nucleus ambiguus in the upper medulla (Fig. 7.29) and supply only stylopharyngeus. The secretomotor fibers come from the inferior salivary nucleus in the lowest part of the pons rostral to the dorsal nucleus of the vagus, and supply the parotid gland via the lesser petrosal nerve and the otic ganglion. Taste fibers from the posterior part of the tongue and afferents from carotid sinus and carotid body enter the nucleus of the tractus solitarius in the lower medulla, while fibers of ordinary sensation from the tongue, pharynx, palate, and tonsil enter the sensory nuclei of the trigeminal nerve.</p>
<p>From the above nuclei, the fibers reach the surface of the medulla between olive and inferior cerebellar peduncle (Fig. 7.22). In a series of rootlets which join to make a single nerve, it emerges in the pontine cistern and runs laterally behind the jugular tubercle of the occipital bone and enters the anterior compartment of the jugular foramen (Fig. 6.96, p. 573). Here it lies lateral to the inferior petrosal sinus; together they are separated from the vagus and accessory nerves by a septum of fibrous dura mater. The glossopharyngeal nerve deeply notches the inferior border of the petrous bone, just below the internal acoustic meatus. Perforating the arachnoid and dura mater, the nerve is distended into its elongated inferior ganglion (the superior ganglion is a small detached part of it); the cell bodies of the nerve&rsquo;s afferent fibers are in these ganglia.</p>
<p>The tympanic branch passes into the middle ear through the tympanic canaliculus to form the tympanic plexus, from which emerges the lesser petrosal nerve. This runs through the foramen ovale (or petrosal foramen) to join the otic ganglion for the supply of the parotid gland.</p>
<p>The nerve to stylopharyngeus, given off as the nerve winds round the muscle, is the only muscular branch.</p>
<p>The carotid sinus nerve provides vital connections with autonomic cell groups in the reticular formation.</p>
<p>Pharyngeal branches take part (with the vagus) in forming the pharyngeal plexus; the fibers are afferent, not motor to the muscles.</p>
<p>The tonsillar branch provides afferent fibers for the tonsillar mucosa, and the lingual branch is sensory to the posterior part of the tongue, with a few secretomotor fibers for lingual glands.</p>
<h3 id="vagus-nerve-x">
  Vagus Nerve (X)
  <a class="anchor" href="#vagus-nerve-x">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The nuclei lie in the upper part of the medulla (Fig. 7.29). There are branchial and visceral fibers that are both afferent and efferent, and also somatic afferents. The branchial motor fibers are from the nucleus ambiguus which innervates all the skeletal muscle supplied by the vagus, i.e., the muscles of the pharynx and upper esophagus, larynx, and palate (largely by accessory nerve fibers which join the vagus). The dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, below the vagal trigone in the floor of the fourth ventricle, supplies cardiac muscle and smooth muscle (of bronchi and gut). The nucleus of the tractus solitarius receives afferent fibers from the heart and thoracic abdominal viscera for many reflex activities. It also receives a few taste fibers from the epiglottis and perhaps fibers of ordinary sensation from parts of the pharynx and larynx, though it is not certain whether these afferent fibers run instead to the sensory nuclei of the trigeminal nerve, which also receives fibers from the small area of skin supplied by the auricular branch of the vagus (over the mastoid process and in the external acoustic meatus).</p>
<p>From the above nuclei, the fibers leave the surface of the medulla in a series of rootlets below those of the glossopharyngeal nerve in the sulcus between olive and inferior cerebellar peduncle (Fig. 7.22). These unite into a single nerve that crosses, below the glossopharyngeal and above the accessory nerve rootlets, the basiocciput behind the jugular tubercle (Fig. 6.96, p. 573). With the accessory nerve, it enters the transverse slit of the middle compartment of the jugular foramen. Here it lies medial to the accessory, and perforates the arachnoid and dura mater. A small superior ganglion lies just above the long inferior ganglion, which distends the vagus below the skull base. The superior ganglion has cell bodies for the unimportant meningeal and auricular branches. The inferior ganglion lodges the cell bodies of all the other sensory fibers in the vagus nerve. At the inferior ganglion, the accessory nerve gives all its nucleus ambiguus fibers to the vagus. This is similar to the motor root of a spinal nerve joining the sensory root just distal to the sensory ganglion. The nucleus ambiguus fibers are wholly motor; they are paid off in the appropriate branches of the vagus to skeletal muscle.</p>
<p>In the neck, the vagus lies vertical, like a plumb line, in the carotid sheath, adherent to the internal carotid and then to the common carotid artery, always deep in the gutter between the artery and the internal jugular vein.</p>
<p>The smallest cervical branches are the meningeal, auricular, and carotid body branches, all afferent.</p>
<p>The pharyngeal branch provides both motor and sensory fibers for the pharyngeal plexus, and passes between the internal and external carotid arteries. The superior laryngeal branch runs deep to the carotids and divides into the internal laryngeal nerve, which pierces the thyrohyoid membrane to supply mucosa in the pharynx and larynx, and the external laryngeal nerve which runs to cricothyroid. Cervical cardiac branches, upper and lower on the right and lower on the left, join the deep part of the cardiac plexus; the upper one on the right joins the superficial part of the plexus. The right recurrent laryngeal nerve hooks under the subclavian artery and runs up at the tracheo-esophageal border to pass under the inferior constrictor of the pharynx just behind the cricothyroid joint, to supply muscles of the larynx and laryngeal mucosa below the level of the vocal folds.</p>
<p>In the thorax, the left recurrent laryngeal nerve hooks round the ligamentum arteriosum, and pursues a similar but longer course to that on the right. Both vagi and the recurrent laryngeals give cardiac branches, and the main nerves themselves give tracheal and esophageal branches and form the esophageal plexuses behind the esophagus.</p>
<p>From the esophageal plexuses, the anterior and posterior vagal trunks emerge, to enter the abdomen through the esophageal opening in the diaphragm; their main purpose is to supply the muscle and glands of the stomach from branches which arise in the lesser omentum.</p>
<p>It should be noted here that the branches to the gut and its derivatives are motor to smooth muscle and secretomotor to glands, but do not carry pain fibers. From abdominal viscera, these run with sympathetic fibers, but the vagus is sensory to the thoracic viscera (esophagus, trachea, and lungs).</p>
<h3 id="accessory-nerve-xi">
  Accessory Nerve (XI)
  <a class="anchor" href="#accessory-nerve-xi">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The accessory nerve has cranial and spinal roots. The cranial root really belongs to the vagus and gives all its fibers to it, for the supply of the skeletal muscles of the pharynx and palate. The fibers come from the nucleus ambiguus and leave the medulla as a series of rootlets below those of the vagus between the olive and inferior cerebellar peduncle. They unite into the single cranial root, which is joined by the spinal root coming up through the foramen magnum into the pontine cistern.</p>
<p>The spinal root is formed by fibers from cell bodies (the &ldquo;spinal accessory nucleus&rdquo;) in the anterior horn of the upper five or six segments of the cervical cord (mainly 2, 3, and 4). Unlike other anterior horn cell axons, they do not leave the cord via the anterior nerve roots, but emerge as a series of roots from the lateral surface of the cord behind the denticulate ligament. Joining together, the roots form a single nerve that passes over the upper tooth of the denticulate ligament to join the cranial root. These two roots have nothing to do with each other and are bound for different destinations. They merely join hands to pass through the jugular foramen together, then part company.</p>
<p>The accessory nerve lies caudal to the vagus on the basiocciput behind the jugular tubercle (Fig. 6.96, p. 573). It passes through the lateral part of the slit-like middle compartment of the jugular foramen, piercing arachnoid and dura mater here. The vagus lies medial to it in the jugular foramen, just in front of the jugular bulb. Outside the skull, the accessory gives all its cranial (nucleus ambiguus) fibers to the vagus, and these are distributed by vagal branches to the striated muscle of the soft palate, pharynx, and esophagus, and larynx. The accessory nerve in the neck, wholly motor and wholly spinal now, lies on the internal jugular vein over the lateral mass of the atlas (Fig. 6.16, p. 463), passes into sternocleidomastoid which it supplies, and then descends within the posterior triangle over levator scapulae to supply trapezius by passing into its deep surface (Fig. 6.2, p. 425).</p>
<p>The nucleus ambiguus fibers joining the vagus conform with the regular pattern of mixed (spinal) nerves. They are analogous to the motor root of the trigeminal nerve. The cranial root of the accessory nerve is actually no more than the motor root (to striated muscle only) of the vagus. The curious pathway of the spinal fibers in the accessory nerve constitutes a mystery.</p>
<h3 id="hypoglossal-nerve-xii">
  Hypoglossal Nerve (XII)
  <a class="anchor" href="#hypoglossal-nerve-xii">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The hypoglossal nucleus is in the medulla. It is motor and somatic, and thus lies against the midline, in the hypoglossal trigone in the floor of the fourth ventricle (Fig. 7.24). The fibers pass ventrally through the inferior olivary nucleus and emerge from the surface of the medulla as a vertical line of rootlets between pyramid and olive (Fig. 7.22). These join into two roots that enter the hypoglossal (anterior condylar) canal in the occipital bone (Fig. 6.96, p. 573). They are here separated by a flange of fibrous dura mater that sometimes ossifies. They pass forward above the atlanto-occipital joint and join in the canal, emerging as a single nerve. They pierce the arachnoid and dura mater in the canal.</p>
<p>Examine a skull; note that the exit is deep (i.e., medial and posterior) to the jugular foramen where the glossopharyngeal, vagus, and accessory emerge. The hypoglossal nerve from this deep position spirals down and forwards with a lateral convexity that brings it gradually more superficial. It spirals down behind the inferior ganglion of the vagus, then descends behind and around the internal and then the external carotid arteries (Fig. 6.17, p. 465). At this level, below the posterior belly of digastric, it lies on three arteries (occipital, external carotid, and lingual) and is very near the skin, covered only by the facial vein beneath the investing layer of deep cervical fascia. This spiral course curves outside the arteries but deep to the veins; it is the pathway of migration of the suboccipital myotomes that form the muscles of the tongue. The hypoglossal nerve now passes forward on hyoglossus deep to mylohyoid (i.e., in the mouth). Running above the greater horn of the hyoid bone, it splits up to supply all the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue except palatoglossus.</p>
<p>The branches of the hypoglossal nerve (before it reaches the tongue) are all derived from C1 nerve fibers that join the hypoglossal at its exit from the skull. The fibers from the hypoglossal nucleus itself have no supply outside the tongue. The branches derived from C1 fibers must still be classified as branches of the hypoglossal nerve, even though their origins are not from the hypoglossal nucleus.</p>
<p>A very small meningeal branch supplies a ring of dura mater in the posterior cranial fossa beyond the margin of the foramen magnum.</p>
<p>The upper root of the ansa cervicalis (the former descendens hypoglossi) branches off as the hypoglossal nerve curves down between the internal carotid artery and the internal jugular vein. It is joined at a variable level by the lower root of the ansa cervicalis (formerly the descendens cervicalis) derived from C2 and 3 nerves of the cervical plexus. Together these nerves make the ansa cervicalis. The ansa lies on the internal jugular vein under cover of sternocleidomastoid embedded in the anterior wall of the carotid sheath. Its branches supply the infrahyoid muscles.</p>
<p>The slender nerve to thyrohyoid (C1) comes off as the main nerve lies on the lingual artery. The last branch is the nerve to geniohyoid (C1), given off in the mouth, above mylohyoid, and contains the last of the C1 fibers that travel along the hypoglossal nerve.</p>

<p>Having relatively short courses, the peripheral parts of cranial nerves are not subject to the kind of injuries that commonly afflict peripheral nerves in the limbs. Those most commonly affected by trauma are the first, second, third, sixth, and seventh, but tumors, ischemia of nerve trunks, and aneurysms of adjacent vessels are among the more usual afflictions of these and other cranial nerves. The following account of selected cranial nerve lesions illustrates the more important features of their clinical anatomy.</p>

  Olfactory Nerve
  <a class="anchor" href="#olfactory-nerve">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Head injury may tear olfactory nerve filaments passing through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid, especially if a fracture involves this part of the anterior cranial fossa. If all filaments on one side are torn, there will be complete anosmia on that side. Test by closing one nostril (with finger pressure) and sniffing familiar substances like coffee or oranges (not strong irritants). Most deficiencies of smell are due to affections of nasal mucosa rather than neurological disease. Remember that smell is an essential component of taste, and complaints about lack of taste may be due to loss of smell. Olfactory hallucinations, which are usually unpleasant, arise from the uncus of the temporal lobe (the cortical center for smell).</p>

  Optic Nerve
  <a class="anchor" href="#optic-nerve">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Assessment of the visual fields tests the integrity of the visual pathways from retina to cortex, and lesions at different points along the path give rise to characteristic defects, as illustrated in Figure 7.8. The defects are conventionally described with reference to the visual fields and not to the retina; recall, for example, that the left half of the visual field of each eye is represented in the right lateral geniculate body and right visual cortex, and that the upper part of the visual field is represented in the lateral part of the lateral geniculate body and in the visual cortex below the calcarine sulcus. The numbers below correspond to the sites of the lesions in Figure 7.8A; clinically, the commonest lesions are at the chiasma (2) and in the optic radiation (4). The visual field defects are indicated in Figure 7.8B.</p>
<ol>
<li>A complete lesion of the left optic nerve gives rise to complete blindness in the left eye.</li>
<li>Compression of the optic chiasma, as by a pituitary tumor, causes bitemporal hemianopia (blindness in the temporal half of both visual fields) because the nasal fibers from each retina are interrupted. This effectively narrows the outer part of each visual field, so that the patient complains of bumping into the sides of a doorway or into people on each side.</li>
<li>A lesion of the left optic tract gives a right homonymous hemianopia, due to interruption of fibers from the same (left) sides of both retinas (hence homonymous, meaning same-sided). The field defects are therefore right-sided.</li>
<li>A lesion of the lower fibers in the left optic radiation (as from an abscess in the temporal lobe spreading upwards from the middle ear) causes a right upper quadrantic homonymous hemianopia, because the lower fibers in the optic radiation (from the lower part of the retina) are represented in the upper part of the visual field.</li>
<li>Similar to (4), a lesion of the upper fibers in the left optic radiation (as from a parietal lobe lesion, and in practice very rare) gives a right lower quadrantic homonymous hemianopia.</li>
<li>A lesion of the anterior part of the left visual cortex (as from occlusion of the posterior cerebral artery) gives a right homonymous hemianopia similar to the optic tract lesion in (3), but there is sparing of the macular (central) vision because the most posterior part of the visual cortex at the very tip of the occipital lobe where macular vision is represented is supplied by the middle cerebral artery.</li>
<li>Traumatic damage to the tip of the left occipital lobe, i.e., to the macular area, gives a right homonymous macular defect.</li>

<p>Ocular nerve palsies have already been described (p. 516), and the following synopsis is simply a reminder of the major signs that were explained in the original descriptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oculomotor nerve:</strong> The eye is looking down and out. The diplopia disappears on looking outwards. The pupil is dilated and does not react to light or on accommodation; ptosis with a large pupil thus suggests an oculomotor nerve lesion (but with a small pupil suggests Horner&rsquo;s syndrome, p. 519).</li>
<li><strong>Trochlear nerve:</strong> The eye cannot look down as far as it should when turned in. The head is tilted towards the opposite shoulder to compensate for extorsion.</li>
<li><strong>Abducent nerve:</strong> The eye cannot look outwards.</li>
</ul>

  Trigeminal Nerve
  <a class="anchor" href="#trigeminal-nerve">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The commonest lesion of the trigeminal nerve is trigeminal neuralgia, a severe paroxysmal pain in the distribution of one or more of the divisions, usually the maxillary or mandibular. The pain is often triggered by light touch to a &ldquo;trigger zone&rdquo; on the face. The cause is unknown, but it is thought to be due to compression of the trigeminal nerve root by a blood vessel.</p>
<h3 id="facial-nerve">
  Facial Nerve
  <a class="anchor" href="#facial-nerve">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Facial nerve paralysis is the commonest of all cranial nerve lesions. The usual type (Bell&rsquo;s palsy) is of uncertain etiology, but is probably a virus infection causing swelling on the nerve in the facial canal just before it emerges from the stylomastoid foramen. There is paralysis of facial muscles giving drooping of the corner of the mouth, inability to close the eye, and loss of forehead wrinkles on the affected side.</p>
<p>A lesion higher in the facial canal, above the origin of the chorda tympani, will add to the facial paralysis a loss of taste in the anterior part of the tongue. Test by holding the tongue out and applying sweet, sour, and salt substances on cotton wool to the sides of the dorsum, asking the patient to point to the appropriate flavor written on a card (and not to speak, since this involves spreading the test substance all over the tongue). The accompanying interference with secretion from the submandibular and sublingual glands is very difficult to detect or test. A lesion higher still, above the origin of the nerve to stapedius, will give hyperacusis.</p>
<p>The above are all lesions of the lower motor neuron (infranuclear). A typical upper motor neuron lesion (supranuclear) paralyzes the lower part of the face but not the upper (forehead and orbicularis oculi) because the upper part of the facial nerve nucleus which innervates the upper musculature is supplied by the cerebral cortex of both sides, whereas the lower part innervating the lower face only receives contralateral cortical fibers (p. 612). However, emotional (as opposed to voluntary) movements of the facial muscles, as in smiling and laughing, are still possible with supranuclear lesions (so presumably there must be alternative pathways through the cerebrum).</p>
<h3 id="vestibulocochlear-nerve-viii-1">
  Vestibulocochlear Nerve (VIII)
  <a class="anchor" href="#vestibulocochlear-nerve-viii-1">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Acoustic neuromas on the extracerebral part of the eighth nerve are among the commonest intracranial tumors, but other lesions of this nerve are rare. In any loss of hearing, it must be determined whether it is conduction deafness from lesions of the external or middle ear, or nerve deafness from a cochlear lesion.</p>
<p>The simple tests for hearing involve asking the patient to listen to whispering (repeating what is said), the ticking of a watch, and the rubbing together of a thumb and forefinger (with the opposite ear closed by finger pressure on the tragus, and after examining the external acoustic meatus and tympanic membrane with an auroscope). Both ears are similarly tested. The basis of the two common tuning fork tests is that air conduction, which involves the amplifying effect of the ossicles across the middle ear cavity, is better than solid bone conduction. In Weber&rsquo;s test, a vibrating tuning fork is placed on the midline of the forehead; in conduction deafness, the sound is heard better in the deaf ear, and in nerve deafness, it is better in the good ear. In Rinne&rsquo;s test, the vibrating fork is held on the mastoid process until the sound is no longer heard and then quickly transferred to the external acoustic meatus; in a normal ear or with nerve deafness, the sound will be heard again, but in conduction deafness, further sound will not be heard. For more precise information, audiometric tests are necessary.</p>
<p>Diseases of the internal ear or its central connections (as in Ménière&rsquo;s disease where there are degenerative changes in the utricle and saccule) form one group of causes of muscular incoordination or ataxia (labyrinthine ataxia; the other varieties of ataxia are cerebellar and sensory - p. 624). The semicircular ducts of the vestibular apparatus can be tested with the head in different positions by irrigating the external acoustic meatus alternately with warm (44°C, 110°F) and cool (30°C, 86°F) water (caloric tests); this stimulates convection currents in the endolymph causing vertigo (giddiness) and nystagmus (p. 515). The slow phase of the nystagmus is in the direction of the movement of the endolymph. Cool water irrigation causes nystagmus to the opposite side, warm to the same side. Inner ear disease gives an exaggerated response with the head in a particular position, whereas vestibular nerve damage gives an exaggerated response in any head position. In vestibular nystagmus, there is a slow phase towards the stimulated side and a quick return (in contrast to ocular nystagmus in which the oscillatory movements are equal in both directions). The absence of vestibulo-ocular reflexes after irrigation with ice-cold water is one of the criteria of brain death (p. 616).</p>
<h3 id="glossopharyngeal-nerve-ix-1">
  Glossopharyngeal Nerve (IX)
  <a class="anchor" href="#glossopharyngeal-nerve-ix-1">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Isolated glossopharyngeal nerve lesions are extremely rare, as the last four cranial nerves are not often damaged and even if they are, they are commonly affected together (e.g., by a posterior cranial fossa tumor). Since the motor part of the glossopharyngeal nerve supplies only one small muscle, stylopharyngeus, it is impossible to test. If necessary, taste sensation on the posterior part of the tongue can be tested.</p>
<h3 id="vagus-nerve-x-1">
  Vagus Nerve (X)
  <a class="anchor" href="#vagus-nerve-x-1">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Through its pharyngeal and laryngeal branches, the motor component of the vagus nerve (nucleus ambiguus) supplies the pharynx, palate, and larynx. Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsies are most commonly due to malignant disease (25%) and surgical damage (20%) during operations on the thyroid gland, neck, esophagus, heart, and lung. Because of its longer course, lesions of the left nerve are much more frequent than those of the right. Test the motor innervation of the vocal cords by listening to the patient&rsquo;s speech and cough and by inspecting the cords through a laryngoscope. Note the presence of any frothy mucus on the paralyzed side at the esophageal opening, suggesting paralysis of cricopharyngeus (if supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve), which allows some regurgitation. In a complete unilateral paralysis (p. 504), the cord takes up an intermediate position between full abduction and adduction; the voice is hoarse and the patient cannot cough in the usual explosive manner. In an incomplete lesion, the cord takes up an adducted position, i.e., the power of abduction seems to be lost first. Despite several theories, there is no universally acceptable explanation why this should be so.</p>
<p>High lesions of the vagus nerve which affect the pharyngeal and superior laryngeal as well as the recurrent laryngeal branches cause difficulty in swallowing as well as vocal cord defects. The motor innervation of the soft palate can be tested by asking the patient to say a prolonged &ldquo;Ah&rdquo; and observing the upward palatal movement; if paralyzed on one side, the unaffected side will rise further and pull the uvula towards the normal side.</p>
<h3 id="accessory-nerve-xi-1">
  Accessory Nerve (XI)
  <a class="anchor" href="#accessory-nerve-xi-1">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The spinal part of the accessory nerve may be damaged in the posterior triangle, paralyzing the upper part of trapezius (but not always the lower part - p. 427). Test by asking the patient to shrug the shoulder. A lesion higher up before the nerve enters sternocleidomastoid will paralyze that muscle also; test by turning the face to the opposite side.</p>
<h3 id="hypoglossal-nerve-xii-1">
  Hypoglossal Nerve (XII)
  <a class="anchor" href="#hypoglossal-nerve-xii-1">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Paralysis of this nerve makes its own half of the tongue immobile, and if of long standing, the tongue will be wasted on that side. Test by asking the patient to put out the tongue; it will deviate towards the affected side due to the unopposed action of the normal half.</p>
<h1 id="osteology-of-the-skull">
  Osteology of the Skull
  <a class="anchor" href="#osteology-of-the-skull">#</a>
</h1>
<p>Strictly speaking, the term &ldquo;skull&rdquo; includes the mandible, and the &ldquo;cranium&rdquo; is the skull without the mandible, but &ldquo;cranium&rdquo; is often used to mean the part of the skull containing the brain. This cranial cavity has a roof or skullcap (cranial vault) and a floor which is the base of the skull. The facial skeleton is the front part of the skull and includes the mandible (Figs 8.1 and 8.2). A study of the intact skull is much more fruitful than undue contemplation of each separate bone. Examination of the disarticulated skull bones displays certain features not visible in the intact skull, but the chief justification for studying individual bones is to understand their manner of articulation as they combine to build up the skull.</p>
<p>The most striking feature of the convex upper surface is its asymmetry. One side is set in front of the other, and this is reflected internally by a similar asymmetry of the cerebral hemispheres and their contained lateral ventricles. Anteriorly, the frontal bone articulates with the pair of parietal bones at the coronal suture; the original two halves of the frontal bone occasionally fail to fuse, leaving a midline metopic suture. The midline meeting place of the bones is the bregma, the site of the anterior fontanelle (Fig. 1.40, p. 47). The coronal suture is straight for 3 cm or more lateral to the bregma (this is the line of closure of the anterior fontanelle) and then becomes highly tortuous as it curves transversely down to the lateral surface of the skull. Behind the bregma, the parietal bones articulate in the midline sagittal suture. The anterior 3 cm of this is straight (the line of closure of the anterior fontanelle) and then comes a tortuous part for 5 cm, followed by a straight part. Alongside this, a parietal foramen often perforates each parietal bone; an emissary vein leaves the superior sagittal sinus through it. Thence the sagittal suture, tortuous again, curves down to the lambda, at the apex of the occipital bone. The center of the parietal bone is a low prominence, the parietal eminence, and this lies on the profile of the skull from this view.</p>
<p>The lambda is the midline point where the sagittal suture meets the lambdoid suture.</p>
<p>Some 6 cm (2½ inches) below the lambda, the occipital bone is projected into the external occipital protuberance, from which a low ridge crosses towards the base of the mastoid process. This is the superior nuchal line (Fig. 8.3); gently convex upwards, it lies at the junction of neck and scalp. It is the surface marking of the internal attachment of the tentorium cerebelli, which straddles the transverse sinus at the roof of the posterior fossa. Trapezius and sternocleidomastoid are attached side by side here (trapezius at the medial one-third and sternocleidomastoid along the lateral two-thirds of the superior nuchal line). Splenius capitis is inserted into the lateral third of the line deep to sternocleidomastoid. Above this is the highest nuchal line, which gives origin to occipitalis and the galea aponeurotica; beneath this part of the scalp, the bare bone covers the occipital pole of the cerebral hemisphere. Below the superior nuchal line, the bone that covers the cerebellar hemispheres gives attachment to the neck muscles (p. 546).</p>
<p>The mastoid region of the temporal bone articulates with the parietal and occipital. The mastoid process projects down from the side, its deep surface channeled into the digastric notch (Fig. 6.75, p. 547). It is best studied in the lateral and inferior views. The suture between the mastoid and occipital bones is commonly perforated by a mastoid emissary foramen, carrying a vein from the sigmoid sinus to the posterior auricular vein (Fig. 8.4).</p>
<p>Note the sutures between the cranial bones. The coronal suture curves down along the posterior border of the frontal bone; it is tortuous above and straight below the inferior temporal line (Fig. 8.1). As it leaves the parietal bone, the coronal suture curves forward where the frontal bone articulates with the greater wing of the sphenoid. The upper border of the greater wing articulates with the inferior angle of the parietal bone; this suture meets the coronal suture at the pterion, which is not a single point but an area with an H-shaped pattern of sutures between frontal, parietal, temporal, and sphenoid bones. The squamous part of the temporal bone articulates in front with the greater wing of the sphenoid and then arches up and back to overlap the parietal bone. The mastoid region of the temporal bone continues this suture with the parietal until posteriorly it meets the occipital bone. The meeting place of these sutures is the asterion.</p>
<p>The mastoid region of the temporal bone is projected down as the blunt mastoid process. To its lateral surface is attached the sternocleidomastoid, with splenius and longissimus capitis lying deep to it. The lateral surface of the mastoid process is built up by a downgrowth of bone from the squamous part of the temporal, and incomplete fusion of the two results commonly in an irregular groove, the squamomastoid suture just short of the borders of the mastoid process (Fig. 6.58, p. 524). In front of this is the external acoustic meatus to be studied later (p. 650). Above the meatus is a horizontal ridge, the suprameatal crest; this is projected forwards as the upper border of the zygomatic process of the temporal bone. The zygomatic arch is continued by the zygomatic bone, which articulates with the maxilla and frontal bone as a pair of anterior pillars of the arch (Fig. 8.1). The arch is further described on page 454.</p>
<p>The frontal process of the zygomatic bone meets the frontal bone at the frontozygomatic suture which is palpable in the living and is used as a landmark for the pterion (above). The zygomatic bone has a sharp posterior border which continues up across the suture as a ridge on the frontal bone. This ridge arches up and back and diverges into the superior and inferior temporal lines. The superior line is traceable around its convexity down towards the mastoid process. The temporalis fascia is attached to the superior line and to the polished strip of bone between the two lines and sweeps down to be attached to the upper border of the zygomatic bone and arch. The inferior temporal line curves around from the zygomatic process of the frontal.</p>
<p>The temporal fossa is the area bounded by the superior temporal line, zygomatic arch, and the frontal process of the zygomatic bone. In the fossa, the greater wing of the sphenoid articulates behind with the squamous temporal to form a convexity which is the lateral wall of the middle cranial fossa, and it articulates in front with the zygomatic bone to form a deep concavity which is the lateral wall of the orbit. The upper border of the greater wing articulates with the parietal and frontal bones; sutural bones are commonly found here, and this is the region of the pterion. The lower limit of the temporal surface of the greater wing is marked by a line of sharp tubercles, the infratemporal crest; this is level with the upper border of the zygomatic arch. On the squamous bone, a vertical groove lies above the external acoustic meatus. This lodges a deep vein and artery of the superficial temporal vessels. Temporalis arises from the whole surface of the temporal fossa. The posterior pillar of the zygomatic arch is grooved to lodge the posterior fibers of the muscle, which glide to and fro across it during mandibular movement. The anterior wall of the temporal fossa is formed by the zygomatic bone.</p>
<p>The zygomatic process of the temporal bone is hollowed by the mandibular fossa in front of the external acoustic meatus; in front of this is the articular tubercle. Note the position of the mandible (Fig. 8.1). Its condyle is in the mandibular fossa, and the coronoid process lies under cover of the temporozygomatic suture. Remove the mandible and reserve it for future study.</p>
<p>The zygomatic arch is formed by the zygomatic process of the temporal bone and the temporal process of the zygomatic bone; they meet at an oblique suture near the front end of the arch. (The term &ldquo;zygoma&rdquo; should not be used; it can mean either the arch or the zygomatic bone.) At the front, the frontal process of the zygomatic bone and the zygomatic process of the maxilla can be considered as the anterior pillars of the arch. The superficial head of masseter arises from the lower border of the arch and as far forwards as the maxilla, and the deep head arises from the concave medial surface of the arch. The temporomandibular ligament is attached to the lateral surface of the articular tubercle deep to the parotid fascia, whose superficial layer is attached to the lower border of the arch in front of this. The temporalis fascia is attached to the upper border of the arch. The arch is crossed in front of the external acoustic meatus by the auriculotemporal nerve and the superficial temporal vessels. Further forward, the arch is crossed by the upper and lower zygomatic branches of the facial nerve. The nerves are vulnerable on this subcutaneous bone, and their division will endanger vision from inability to close the lids with resulting desiccation and ulceration of the cornea. Deep to the arch, the temporalis slides freely up and down with movements of the mandible.</p>
<p>Below the arch, the upper jaw can be studied. The posterior convexity of the maxilla nears the lower part of the lateral pterygoid plate; inferiorly, the pyramidal process (tubercle) of the palatine bone is wedged between them (Fig. 8.5). The maxilla and pterygoid plate are separated above this by the pterygomaxillary fissure (Fig. 6.11, p. 448). In its depths lies the pterygopalatine fossa, and the sphenopalatine foramen can be seen here, opening into the lateral wall of the nose. The fossa is not fully visible in the intact skull (it is described on p. 466).</p>
<p>The tuberosity of the maxilla is a prominent boss of bone that projects above the posterior surface of the last molar tooth (Fig. 8.4). The buccinator arises from a linear strip on the body of the maxilla; the line extends from level with the anterior border of the first molar tooth, skirting the base of the zygomatic process of the maxilla and keeping well above the alveolar bone until it turns down posteriorly to the tuberosity. From the tuberosity, a fibrous band, the pterygomaxillary ligament (Fig. 6.11, p. 448) for the origin of the buccinator passes to the tip of the hamulus. Below the line of buccinator is the vestibule of the mouth; above it are the soft tissues of the face. From the tuberosity of the maxilla and the pyramidal process of the palatine bone, the small inferior head of the medial pterygoid arises overlapping the inferior head of the lateral pterygoid, which arises from the whole surface of the lateral pterygoid plate. The posterior convexity of the maxilla above the tuberosity shows two or more foramina for the posterior superior alveolar nerves and vessels.</p>
<p>The zygomatic process of the maxilla is a strong buttress of bone that transmits the forces of mastication from the molar teeth up to the zygomatic bone and thence to the frontal bone. It is palpable through the cheek, or better still in the vestibule (feel your own!). It is hollowed by the apex of the maxillary sinus. The anterior pillar of the zygomatic arch is buttressed higher up, for here the zygomatic bone articulates with the zygomatic process of the frontal bone.</p>
<p>The piriform (anterior nasal) aperture, bounded below by the sharp projection of the anterior nasal spine, is on the profile of the skull, but the face bones visible from this aspect are best studied from in front. Note in this lateral view, however, the ridge formed by the root of the canine tooth. Between the canine ridge and the zygomatic process is the canine fossa. Between the canine ridge and the midline is the incisive fossa. (Note that the term &ldquo;incisive fossa&rdquo; is also used to denote the small pit on the hard palate into which the incisive foramen opens; see p. 480).</p>
<h2 id="anterior-view">
  Anterior View
  <a class="anchor" href="#anterior-view">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The frontal bone (sometimes bisected by a metopic suture) curves down to make the upper margins of the orbits (Fig. 8.2). Medially, it goes down to meet the frontal process of each maxilla, between which it articulates with the nasal bones. Laterally, it projects down as a zygomatic process to make the frontozygomatic suture with the zygomatic bone at the lateral margin of the orbit. Postpone the study of the orbital cavity (p. 505) and note that the frontal bone occupies the upper third of the anterior view of the skull, the maxillae and mandible making the other two-thirds.</p>
<p>The nasal bones curve downwards and forwards from their articulation with the frontal bone. Each articulates with the frontal process of the maxilla, and they arch forward to meet in a midline suture. The lower border of each is notched by the external nasal nerve. These free borders make with the two maxillae a pear-shaped piriform (anterior nasal) aperture (Fig. 8.2). In the nasal cavity, the bony septum and the conchae of the lateral wall are visible, but their study is best postponed. The two maxillae meet in a midline intermaxillary suture, and are projected forward as the anterior nasal spine at the lower margin of the nasal aperture. The canine root makes a ridge on the anterior surface of the maxilla. Between this and the intermaxillary suture lies a slight depression unofficially called the incisive fossa (but this is confusing since that is the proper name for the space into which the incisive canals open at the front of the hard palate - p. 479). The incisive slips of orbicularis oris arise high in this fossa, near the midline. Lateral to the canine ridge is the canine fossa, from which levator anguli oris arises. Above this, the anterior surface of the maxilla is perforated by the infraorbital foramen. Levator labii superioris alaeque nasi arises from the frontal process of the maxilla, and levator labii superioris arises from the lower margin of the orbit (i.e., from maxilla and zygomatic bone) and hangs down like a curtain over the infraorbital foramen and its issuing nerve. Note that the attachments of buccinator and levator anguli oris, horizontal around the body of the maxilla, bisect the maxillary sinus, which lies with its lower half deep to the vestibule and its upper half deep to the soft tissues of the face. Nearer the midline, the incisive slips of orbicularis oris arise from the same horizontal level; the mucous membrane of the vestibule is reflected from the maxilla to line all these muscles. As before, the study of the mandible will be deferred, but while it is in position, note that the supraorbital notch, infraorbital foramen, and mental foramen lie all three in a vertical line. The osteology of the orbital walls and margin is summarized on page 505.</p>
<h2 id="inferior-view">
  Inferior View
  <a class="anchor" href="#inferior-view">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The area behind the foramen magnum is simple, and consists largely of the squamous part of the occipital bone. From the mastoid process to the external occipital protuberance, the superior nuchal line lies in a curve concentric with the foramen magnum. Halfway between them, the inferior nuchal line is concentric with both. The external occipital crest, in the midline between the external occipital protuberance and the foramen magnum, bisects this area. A rather vague line, radiating back and outwards from the foramen magnum, further bisects each half. Thus, four areas are demarcated in each half (Fig. 8.3). There are two alongside the foramen magnum, and they receive the rectus muscles: the medial area receives rectus capitis posterior minor, and the lateral area receives rectus capitis posterior major (Fig. 6.75, p. 547). Between superior and inferior nuchal lines, the medial area receives semispinalis capitis, and the lateral area gives attachment to the superior oblique muscle of the head.</p>
<p>The area in front of the foramen magnum is more difficult. It is a complicated mixture of processes and foramina, but do not be dismayed. A general survey will clarify the picture, and the following one-third:two-thirds summary will prove useful (Fig. 8.3).</p>
<p>Draw a transverse line across the base of the skull, joining the anterior poles of the two mastoid processes. One-third of the skull base lies in front and two-thirds behind this line. The occipital condyles have the reverse proportions; two-thirds of the condyle lies in front of the line. Now identify the pterygoid tubercle by tracing the posterior border of the medial pterygoid plate from the hamulus up to the base of the skull. Here the pterygoid tubercle projects back towards the foramen lacerum. Note that the back of the nose (between the medial pterygoid plates) is the same width as the diameter of the foramen magnum, and is set forward at such a distance that a line joining the tip of the mastoid process to the pterygoid tubercle slants in at 45° - right and left lines lie at right angles to each other. This 45° slant along the petrous part of the temporal bone imprints itself on many structures at the base of the skull. The line is divided into thirds by the styloid process and spine of the sphenoid, so the stylomastoid foramen and the foramen spinosum can be located. The stylomastoid foramen lies behind the base of the styloid process, and the foramen spinosum perforates the base of the spine of the sphenoid. The spine of the sphenoid overlies the opening in the petrous bone of the bony part of the auditory tube. The cartilaginous part of the tube, slanting at 45°, lies below the slit between the greater wing of the sphenoid and the apex of the petrous bone (Fig. 8.4). The foramen ovale perforates the greater wing along a 45° slant anterior and medial to the foramen spinosum. Lateral to the pterygoid tubercle is the scaphoid fossa; from here to the spine of the sphenoid, tensor palati arises from the greater wing along the 45° slant.</p>
<p>One-third of the way from the anterior margin of the foramen magnum to the back of the nasal septum (vomer), the pharyngeal tubercle projects from the basiocciput (Fig. 8.3). On either side, a ridge curves laterally, marking the attachment of the prevertebral fascia and the pharyngobasilar fascia. The attachment of the pharynx can now be marked out on the base of the skull (p. 487). Note that the apex of the petrous bone with its attached levator palati muscle lies wholly in the pharynx (Fig. 8.4).</p>
<p><strong>Occipital bone.</strong> This has a basilar part, commonly called the basiocciput, in front of the foramen magnum, a lateral part on each side bearing condyles, and a squamous part behind and above the foramen. The foramen magnum is oval in shape, its long diameter being anteroposterior. Its transverse diameter is rather less than one-third of the distance between the mastoid processes (Fig. 8.3). The fibrous dura mater is attached to the margins of the foramen as it sweeps down from the posterior cranial fossa. Within the tube of dura mater, the lower medulla with the spinal arteries and veins, the vertebral arteries, and the spinal roots of the accessory nerves traverse the foramen in the subarachnoid space (Fig. 6.96, p. 573). Meningeal branches of the vertebral artery and communicating veins from the occipital sinuses to the internal vertebral plexus lie outside the fibrous dura, between it and the periosteum of the foramen magnum laterally and posteriorly. Anteriorly, the margin of the foramen gives attachment to the ligaments sweeping up from the axis. Adherent to dura mater is the tectorial membrane, and in front of this is the vertical limb of the cruciform ligament; in front again are the apical and the pair of alar ligaments of the dens of the axis. All are attached, in front of the dura mater, to the anterior margin of the foramen magnum. The alar ligaments are attached each to a triangular area medial to the anterior pole of the occipital condyle. These triangular areas are limited anteriorly by a ridge that joins the anterior poles of the occipital condyles. The anterior atlanto-occipital membrane is attached to the ridge. The posterior atlanto-occipital membrane is attached to the posterior margin of the foramen magnum; observe that this is a curve of more than half the foramen. Both membranes are attached right up to the capsules of the atlanto-occipital joints. Tangential with the posterior margin of the foramen magnum is the line of fusion between the squamous and jugular parts of the occipital bone (it fuses at the second year, see p. 658).</p>
<p>The occipital condyles are convex kidney-shaped surfaces, covered with hyaline cartilage, beside the front half of the foramen magnum. Their posterior poles are separated by the diameter of the foramen, but their anterior poles are much closer together. The two convexities make a ball-and-socket joint with the atlas. But the anteroposterior curve is more pronounced than the combined side-to-side curvature; the ball is oval-shaped, like an egg lying on its side, and thus permits nodding and some abduction but no rotation. The capsule and synovial membrane are attached to the articular margins. The epiphyseal cartilage between basiocciput and exocciput crosses this joint. Fusion (at the sixth year) is sometimes incomplete, and the condyle may then possess two separate articular surfaces. Behind the condyle is the shallow condylar fossa floored by thin bone. This is commonly perforated by the condylar canal, carrying a vein from the bottom of the sigmoid sinus to the suboccipital venous plexus. Deep to the summit of the occipital condyle at the site of the original epiphysis, the bone is perforated by the hypoglossal canal. The hypoglossal nerve enters this as two roots, separated by a flange of fibrous dura mater. The flange may ossify but does not extend to the anterior aperture of the canal, for here the nerve issues as a single trunk, medial to the jugular foramen. This foramen, lateral to the canal, is bounded by the jugular notch in the lateral projection of the occipital bone called the jugular process (Fig. 8.4). The jugular process articulates laterally with the mastoid part of the temporal bone; the occipital artery grooves the suture between them. The jugular process, at the posterior margin of the jugular foramen, gives attachment to rectus capitis lateralis, and the prevertebral fascia is attached to the edge of the bone behind the internal jugular vein (Fig. 6.6, p. 441).</p>
<p>The basiocciput extends forward from the foramen magnum and fuses (at 25 years) with the basisphenoid just behind the nose and 2.5 cm (1 inch) in front of the foramen magnum. In front of the pharyngeal tubercle, the bone forms the roof of the nasopharynx, whose mucous membrane is attached to the periosteum. Alongside the pharyngeal tubercle, the ridges, convex forwards, for the prevertebral fascia and pharyngobasilar fascia have already been noted (Fig. 8.4). Behind each is the insertion of longus capitis, with rectus capitis anterior behind this muscle, immediately in front of the occipital condyle and medial to the hypoglossal canal (Fig. 6.6, p. 441).</p>
<p><strong>Temporal bone.</strong> There are four parts of this bone, separately ossified and afterwards fused. The petrous part (often called petromastoid to indicate that the mastoid region belongs mostly to the petrous part), set at a slant of 45°, forms a substantial part of the skull base alongside the occipital bone. The squamous part, undulating from the concavity of the mandibular fossa to the convexity of the articular tubercle, makes a small part of the skull base lateral to this, but most of the squamous part is in the temporal fossa on the side wall of the skull. The zygomatic process belongs to the squamous parts. There is an anterior angle between the squamous and petrous parts, and here the greater wing of the sphenoid is slotted in. The tympanic part, rolled up like a scroll, lies below the petrous and squamous parts, and behind it the styloid process projects like a carpenter&rsquo;s nail from the surface of the petrous bone. Study these four parts of the temporal bone in turn (Fig. 8.4).</p>
<p>The mastoid process is grooved, sometimes deeply, by the digastric notch for the origin of the posterior belly of the digastric. Medial to this notch, a groove for the occipital artery indents the bone along the temporo-occipital suture. The base of the styloid process lies one-third of the way from the tip of the mastoid process to the pterygoid tubercle. The length of the process is very variable. The stylopharyngeus arises high up medially, the stylohyoid high up posteriorly, and the styloglossus low down in front. The stylohyoid ligament passes on from its tip. Behind its base is the stylomastoid foramen, transmitting the facial nerve and the stylomastoid branch of the posterior auricular artery. Medial to the styloid process, the petrous bone is deeply hollowed out to form the jugular notch. The shallower jugular notch in the occipital bone lies behind, and the two notches form the jugular foramen, which here lodges the jugular bulb at the beginning of the internal jugular vein. Anteromedially, each bone has a smaller notch for the anterior part of the jugular foramen. Here emerge the vagus and accessory nerves with, in front of them, the glossopharyngeal nerve and the inferior petrosal sinus. The glossopharyngeal itself makes a deep notch in the petrous bone (better seen from the posterior cranial fossa) and here lie its sensory ganglia. In the floor of the notch is the external opening of the cochlear canaliculus (aqueduct of the cochlea).</p>
<p>Anterior to the jugular notch, the petrous part is perforated by the carotid canal. The internal carotid artery enters here and turns forward into the bone. The carotid sheath is attached to the margins of the canal. The ridge of the bone between the jugular notch and the carotid canal is perforated by multiple small foramina. One of these in the center of the ridge transmits the tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve; the others carry caroticotympanic branches from the internal carotid artery and sympathetic filaments from the carotid plexus. Anterolateral to the carotid canal, at the margin of the petrous bone, is the opening of the bony part of the auditory tube, overlapped somewhat by the spine of the sphenoid. Introduce a bristle into the opening and note that it passes back into the middle ear. Lay the other end of the bristle over the third molar tooth of the opposite side; the first 2.5 cm of the bristle as it emerges from the bony tube indicates the exact line and inclination of the cartilaginous part of the tube. Note that the tube is not parallel with the base of the skull but passes downwards towards its nasopharyngeal opening at an angle of about 20°. The apex of the petrous bone, rectangular from this view, passes forward at 45° to lodge itself between the basiocciput and greater wing of the sphenoid. No sutures are formed here, and a wide slit often lies between the petrous bone and the greater wing. The cartilaginous part of the auditory tube is lodged below the slit, on a 45° anteromedial slant. Levator palati arises from the rectangular area at the apex of the petrous and from the cartilaginous tube. The pharyngobasilar fascia is attached behind levator palati, anterior to the carotid canal, and the mucous membrane of the nasopharynx is attached in front of the muscle. The extreme tip of the petrous bone, perforated by the internal carotid artery as it turns up into the middle cranial fossa, varies greatly in shape. This irregularity forms a boundary of the foramen lacerum between the basiocciput and the greater wing of the sphenoid. The foramen lacerum is completely closed here in life by dense fibrous tissue that extends across from the periosteum of the adjacent bones. Apart from minute emissary veins, no major structure passes through the foramen lacerum from the cranial cavity to the exterior.</p>
<p>The tympanic part (Fig. 8.1) is a scroll-like piece of bone projected into a sharp lower border which lies in the characteristic 45° anteromedial obliquity. The part of it that is indented forwards by the styloid process (Fig. 8.4) is the vaginal process. The deep layer of the parotid fascia is attached to the sharp border as far medially as the carotid canal. The parotid fascia is thickened between the vaginal process and angle of the mandible as the stylomandibular ligament. (The thickening might unambiguously have been called the vaginomandibular ligament.)</p>
<p>The tympanic part is C-shaped in section, open above. Laterally, it is lodged below the squamous and mastoid parts, and here forms the bony part of the external acoustic meatus. More medially, it lies below an excavation in the petrous part and here forms the bony wall of the middle ear. Now make the postponed inspection of the lateral margin of the tympanic part. The bone is everted somewhat, and to its margins is attached the cartilaginous part of the external acoustic meatus. Posteriorly, the bone lies against the mastoid process, and the trespassing auricular branch of the vagus emerges from its imprisonment between the two bones. Anteriorly, the tympanic part rests against a flange of squamous bone unofficially but appropriately named the postglenoid tubercle (Fig. 8.5). Note now that the squamous bone carries a sharp crest, the suprameatal spine, in the gap between the margins of the tympanic part; it completes the bony ring of the external acoustic meatus. A horizontal upper tangent and a vertical posterior tangent of the meatus enclose with the suprameatal spine a concavity clinically named the suprameatal triangle. This is the mark for the tympanic antrum, which lies 15 mm deep to the surface. Through the depths of the meatus can be seen the promontory of the middle ear, sometimes etched by fine lines made by the tympanic plexus. The round and oval windows can be seen too, for there is no tympanic membrane to obstruct this view of the medial wall of the middle ear.</p>
<p>Return now to the inferior view of the skull base. The tympanic and squamous parts meet at the transverse squamotympanic fissure in the mandibular fossa (Fig. 8.4). Here is attached the capsule of the mandibular joint. In the depths of this fissure, well to the medial end, behind the spine of the sphenoid, is a thin flange of bone. This is the projecting margin of the tegmen tympani, part of the petrous bone that has grown down from the roof of the middle ear (p. 48). It divides the medial end of the squamotympanic fissure into the petrosquamous fissure in front, for the capsule of the jaw joint, and the petrotympanic fissure behind. Deep in the petrotympanic fissure, the chorda tympani emerges and passes down in a groove on the medial surface of the spine of the sphenoid. Inspect once again the opening of the bony part of the auditory tube and note that the flange from the tegmen tympani forms its lateral boundary. The flange encloses, in fact, the canal for the tensor tympani muscle (Fig. 8.8).</p>
<p>The squamous part of the temporal bone (most of which is seen on the lateral side of the skull) is hollowed out to form the mandibular fossa. This rather spoon-shaped concavity does not lie completely transversely but slightly obliquely, with its lateral end a little farther forward than the medial end; this is to conform with the obliquity of the condyle of the mandible (p. 665). The capsule of the joint is attached to the medial and lateral margins of the fossa. In front of the fossa is the convexity of the articular tubercle. The lateral extremity of this transverse ridge projects at the lower margin of the zygomatic process. Anterior to the convexity of the tubercle is a curved line which marks the attachment of the capsule of the temporomandibular joint (Fig. 8.5). A small triangular area of squamous bone in front of this forms part of the infratemporal surface of the skull. From the region of the fossa and tubercle, the zygomatic process projects laterally, then forwards; it belongs to the squamous part of the bone.</p>
<p><strong>Sphenoid bone.</strong> Only the greater wing enters into the base of the cranium here. It forms a suture with the squamous temporal. Together these make the infratemporal surface, the size of a thumb print, and the pad of the thumb rests comfortably here. The upper head of lateral pterygoid arises from this surface. Anteriorly, the surface ends at the inferior orbital fissure behind the maxilla. Medially, the greater wing ends in a straight edge alongside the 45° obliquity of the apex of the petrous bone. The posterior end of this edge projects down as the spine of the sphenoid, whose base is perforated by the foramen spinosum for the middle meningeal vessels (Fig. 8.5). The sphenomandibular ligament is attached to the tip of the spine. Forwards and medially is the much larger foramen ovale for the mandibular nerve. Medial to the foramen ovale may be a small venous foramen (of Vesalius) for a vein joining the cavernous sinus to the pterygoid plexus. Behind the foramen ovale, less commonly, may be the small petrosal foramen for the lesser petrosal nerve. When these foramina do not exist, the vein and the nerve traverse the foramen ovale itself. Tensor palati arises from the edge of the greater wing (between the scaphoid fossa and the spine) and from the cartilaginous part of the auditory tube alongside it.</p>
<p>Towards the front, the inferior view of the skull exposes the hard palate and the back of the nose, with the pterygoid plates. The medial and lateral pterygoid plates project down from a common pterygoid process of the sphenoid at the base of the skull.</p>
<p>The medial pterygoid plate forms the posterior boundary of the nose. Its lower end is projected laterally as a delicate spur, the pterygoid hamulus (Fig. 8.3). To its tip is attached a fibrous band (the pterygomaxillary ligament) which passes across to the tuberosity of the maxilla. This band gives origin to the buccinator, and it converts the curved hamulus into a fibro-osseous canal for the tensor palati (Fig. 6.11, p. 448). Attached to the tip of the hamulus is the pterygomandibular raphe. The posterior border of the medial pterygoid plate is projected into a spur, below which the pharyngobasilar fascia and the superior pharyngeal constrictor are attached down to the hamulus. The expanded free end of the cartilaginous tube is slotted against the border of the medial pterygoid plate above the spur. The upper end of the medial plate projects back into the foramen lacerum as the pterygoid tubercle already seen (Fig. 8.5). From the spur, a slender ridge runs up to the base of the skull towards the lateral pterygoid plate; the deeply concave scaphoid fossa is thus enclosed lateral to the pterygoid tubercle. From the fossa, the anterior fibers of tensor palati arise. The pterygoid tubercle projects beyond the opening of the pterygoid canal in the foramen lacerum. A bristle inserted here will traverse the canal and enter the pterygopalatine fossa. This access from below is closed in life by a dense fibrous tissue that floors the foramen lacerum, but in the dried skull, it is easier to enter the canal from below. In some skulls, the opening of the canal is actually visible from below (see p. 656). A glance at a disarticulated sphenoid bone will clarify this point (Fig. 8.7); the posterior opening of the pterygoid canal is in the same vertical line as the medial pterygoid plate.</p>
<p>In the roof of the nose, the medial pterygoid plate extends medially below the body of the sphenoid to articulate with the vomer. This medial extension of the roof of the medial pterygoid plate, ensheathing the body of the sphenoid, is the vaginal process. A vomerovaginal suture is thus formed, opening posteriorly as the vomerovaginal canal. Through it passes the minute pharyngeal branch of the sphenopalatine artery. In the lateral wall of the nose, the vertical plate of the palatine bone articulates with the medial pterygoid plate (p. 473), and the articulation between the palatine bone and vaginal process of the medial pterygoid plate encloses the palatovaginal canal. This opens posteriorly in the vault of the nose half a centimeter in front of its posterior limit (Fig. 8.5). Pass a bristle through this canal; it enters the pterygopalatine fossa, as can be seen by a glance at the lateral surface of the skull, looking into the pterygomaxillary fissure. The pharyngeal branch of the pterygopalatine ganglion runs back through the palatovaginal canal and supplies the back of the roof of the nose and thence the nasopharynx. It is accompanied by the pharyngeal branch from the third part of the maxillary artery.</p>
<p>The lateral pterygoid plate extends back and laterally into the space of the infratemporal fossa (Fig. 8.5). It is a bony flange whose purpose is to give attachments to the pterygoid muscles. The whole of its lateral surface gives origin to the lower head of the lateral pterygoid, while the whole of its medial surface gives origin to the upper head of the medial pterygoid. The lateral plate is attached to the base of the skull at the anterior pole of the foramen ovale; it springs from a common stem with the medial plate.</p>
<p>The adjacent lower borders of the two plates are excavated into the triangular pterygoid notch (Fig. 8.7). This is filled by the triangular extremity of the pyramidal process of the palatine bone (Fig. 8.11).</p>
<p>The hard palate (p. 480) is arched more by the downward projecting alveolar processes of the maxillae than by any upward concavity of the palatal processes. The incisive foramina and fossa and the greater and lesser palatine foramina have already been studied (pp. 480 and 466). The sharp crest of the palatine bone forms the posterior border of the greater palatine notch, which fits a similar notch in the body of the maxilla to make the greater palatine foramen. The crest curves back towards the midline, where it becomes less prominent and fades out in the backward projection of the bone at the midline posterior nasal spine. Behind the crest, the palatine bone is perforated by two or three lesser palatine foramina. Here the palatine bone forms its pyramidal process (formerly called the tubercle of the palatine) which projects laterally behind the tuberosity of the maxilla and then expands to occupy the notch between the lower borders of the pterygoid plates of the sphenoid (Fig. 8.12).</p>
<p>The teeth (p. 477) are carried in the alveolar process of the maxilla, which projects behind the palatal process to articulate with the horizontal plate of the palatine bone (Fig. 8.5). Two incisors, one canine, two premolars (bicuspids), and three molars make up the permanent teeth of each maxilla, matching those in each half of the mandible (see p. 663).</p>
<p>The inner surface of the cranial vault shows a midline groove, widening as it is traced back, for the superior sagittal sinus. Pits in and lateral to the groove are the indentations of arachnoid granulations, those outside the sinus being in the lateral blood lakes. The grooves for the anterior and posterior branches of the middle meningeal vessels run back and up across the side of the skull and reach the vault. Their surface markings can now be checked (p. 562).</p>
<p>The internal surface of the base of the skull is in three levels, like the steps of a staircase: the anterior, middle, and posterior cranial fossae. The anterior fossa lodges the frontal lobe, and its floor is level with the upper margin of the orbit. The middle fossa lodges the temporal lobe, and its floor is level with the upper border of the zygomatic arch. The posterior fossa lodges the brainstem and cerebellum, and the attachment of its roof (the tentorium) lies behind the suprameatal crest along the superior nuchal line, at the upper limit of the neck muscles.</p>
<p>The anterior cranial fossa lies highest of the three. Its posterior boundary is a sharp concavity made by the lesser wing of the sphenoid (Fig. 6.89, p. 561). Laterally, the lesser wing meets the frontal bone and greater wing, and so the posterior border is continued to the side wall of the skull at the pterion. Here the bone is commonly tunneled for a short distance by the anterior branch of the middle meningeal artery running up and back. The medial end of the lesser wing is projected back as the anterior clinoid process. In front of this, the base of the lesser wing is perforated by the optic canal, but this is in the middle cranial fossa, as is the prechiasmatic groove between the two canals; the anterior margin of the groove is the dividing line centrally between the anterior and middle fossae. The bone in front of the groove is the jugum of the sphenoid, the yoke joining the two lesser wings together. The jugum (part of the body of the sphenoid) articulates in front with the cribriform plate of the ethmoid. (In many Asiatic skulls, the two halves of the frontal bone fuse in the midline between the cribriform plate and the body of the sphenoid).</p>
<p>The floor of the anterior cranial fossa is formed by the orbital surface of the frontal bone, which is convex upwards and corresponds with the orbital surface of the frontal lobe of the cerebral hemisphere. The frontal sinus invades a variable area at the anteromedial part of the roof of the orbit. Medially, the upward convexity is replaced by a flatter part which roofs in the ethmoidal sinuses and articulates with the cribriform plate. Anteriorly, the groove for the sagittal sinus is traceable down as a midline crest for the falx cerebri, and behind the lower end of the crest is the foramen caecum, which is plugged by the fibrous tissue of the falx, making a huge Sharpey&rsquo;s fiber. The midline of the cribriform plate is projected up as a sharp triangle, the crista galli, for attachment of the falx. Alongside the anterior end of the crista galli is an elongated slit. Pass a bristle through the anterior ethmoidal foramen in the medial wall of the orbit; it will pass obliquely forwards between frontal and ethmoid bones and lie over the cribriform plate. This is the oblique course of the anterior ethmoidal nerve and vessels (Fig. 6.89, p. 561), which, beneath the fibrous dura mater, lie on the cribriform plate and enter the roof of the nose through this slit, which has no official name but which might be called the nasal slit. The remaining perforations, small and round, in the cribriform plate are for the olfactory nerves. At the posterolateral angle of the cribriform plate, a shallow fossa indents the frontal bone; this lodges the olfactory bulb.</p>
<p>The middle cranial fossa is butterfly-shaped. The small body of the butterfly is the body of the sphenoid between the clinoid processes, while the wings of the butterfly expand hugely into a concavity that extends out to the lateral wall of the skull and back to the upper border of the petrous bone. The body of the sphenoid is centrally hollowed out into the pituitary fossa, properly called the sella turcica (&ldquo;Turkish saddle&rdquo;) with a hump in front, the tuberculum sellae (Fig. 6.91, p. 564). At the back, the transverse dorsum sellae (back of the saddle) projects up, and the upper border of the dorsum sellae ends at each side as the posterior clinoid process (a bedpost on the back of the saddle; the anterior clinoids belong to the lesser wing of sphenoid - see above).</p>
<p>A sheet of fibrous dura mater, the diaphragma sellae, sweeps across from the tuberculum sellae to the anterior and posterior clinoid processes to roof the pituitary fossa and the cavernous sinuses. It is perforated centrally for the pituitary stalk, and the roof of each cavernous sinus is pierced anteriorly by the internal carotid artery, which grooves the medial edge of the anterior clinoid process. Medial to the carotid groove is an elevation, the middle clinoid process. It lies at the lateral end of the tuberculum sellae. To it and to the posterior clinoid process is attached a flange of dura mater that descends vertically between the cavernous sinus and the pituitary fossa, and sweeps medially to floor the fossa. The tip of the anterior clinoid process gives attachment to a ridge of dura mater along the lateral border of the roof of the cavernous sinus; the ridge of dura passes lateral to the posterior clinoid process and is continued posteriorly as the free edge of the tentorium cerebelli (Fig. 6.89, p. 561).</p>
<p>In front of the tuberculum sellae and carotid grooves, the fibrous dura mater floors the prechiasmatic groove and is projected into the optic canals around the optic nerves as they pass into the orbits. The optic chiasma lies at a higher level well behind the groove. Vertically above the groove is a space in which lies the anterior communicating artery and above that is the rostrum of the corpus callosum; this space is the chiasmatic cistern.</p>
<p>The side of the body of the sphenoid is grooved by the S-shaped internal carotid artery from the foramen lacerum to the anterior clinoid process, so forming the carotid groove (Fig. 6.91, p. 564). Lateral to this, the floor of the middle fossa is made by the greater wing of the sphenoid and the temporal bone. The greater wing here borders on the apex of the petrous bone and the side of the body of the sphenoid bone, enclosing the irregular foramen lacerum. The internal carotid artery emerges from the apex of the petrous bone to occupy the upper part of the foramen lacerum and then deeply grooves the sphenoid. The lateral ridge of the groove in the sphenoid is often prominent as the lingula (Fig. 6.91, p. 564). Beneath the lingula is the opening of the pterygoid canal, but it is more difficult to introduce a bristle into the foramen under the lingula than from the base of the dried skull beneath the pterygoid tubercle (p. 652). This is, however, the course of the greater petrosal nerve, for the foramen lacerum is floored in by dense fibrous tissue. The nerve passes below the trigeminal ganglion and the internal carotid artery, above the fibrous floor of the foramen lacerum, to join the deep petrosal nerve at the pterygoid canal. Lateral to the foramen lacerum, the apex of the petrous bone shows the trigeminal impression, occupied by the trigeminal ganglion (Fig. 6.89, p. 561).</p>
<p>At the tip of the apex of the petrous bone is a sharp spike, medial to which is a narrow groove for the inferior petrosal sinus and the abducent nerve. To this spike is attached the petroclinoid ligament; it extends from the spike to halfway up the side of the dorsum sellae (Fig. 6.94, p. 566). Lateral to the spike is a broad shallow groove made by the sensory root of the trigeminal nerve (the small motor root is deep to it). The trigeminal groove passes forward into the impression for the trigeminal ganglion. Lateral to this, the posterior border of the middle fossa is grooved by the superior petrosal sinus, and to the lips of this narrow groove, the tentorium cerebelli is attached, straddling the sinus.</p>
<p>The posterior border of the middle fossa is the upper border of the petrous bone. At its junction with the side wall of the skull, it is grooved by the inferior temporal gyrus (Fig. 6.94, p. 566). Medial to the groove is a prominence, the arcuate eminence, which is made by the underlying anterior semicircular canal. Medial to the arcuate eminence, the petrous bone passes forwards and medially at 45°. Its upper surface is perforated and grooved by the greater petrosal nerve; the groove passes obliquely into the foramen lacerum, and the nerve lies beneath the trigeminal ganglion here. Parallel and anterolateral to this is a small groove made by the lesser petrosal nerve; this groove is directed towards the foramen ovale.</p>
<p>In front of the petrous part of the temporal bone is the greater wing of the sphenoid and a small part of the squamous temporal; this area has already been seen from below as the thumb-print sized roof of the infratemporal fossa (p. 651). The greater wing is perforated by the small foramen spinosum and, anteromedial to this, by the much larger foramen ovale. From the foramen spinosum, a groove for the middle meningeal artery leads forward; this soon splits into anterior and posterior branches whose courses are marked by the grooves already noted. The grooves are made by the middle meningeal veins (the so-called veins are actually sinuses in the dura mater).</p>
<p>The foramen ovale perforates the greater wing in front of the trigeminal impression at the apex of the petrous temporal bone. The foramen ovale transmits the mandibular nerve, whose sensory and motor roots join in the foramen. A vein from the cavernous sinus passes down to the pterygoid plexus, and the lesser petrosal nerve lies here too. The accessory meningeal artery runs up to supply the trigeminal ganglion, and the meningeal branch of the mandibular nerve (nervus spinosus) commonly runs with the artery instead of going through the foramen spinosum. Just medial to the foramen ovale, the fibrous dura mater peels away from the endosteal layer to stretch up as the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus. In front of the foramen ovale is the foramen rotundum, which opens forwards into the pterygopalatine fossa. It transmits the maxillary nerve. The fibrous dura mater of the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus blends with the periosteum of the greater wing at the lateral margin of the foramen rotund</p>
