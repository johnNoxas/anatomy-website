of the anterior abdominal wall have been dealt with as part of the body wall (p. 241). To facilitate the clinical description of pain, swellings, etc., the abdomen is divided into areas or regions that are defined by lines on the surface of the anterior abdominal wall. The simplest method is to divide it into four quadrants by vertical and transverse lines through the umbilicus, but usually nine regions are delineated by two vertical and two horizontal lines (Fig. 5.1). The vertical line on each side corresponds to the midclavicular line; when extended downwards it reaches the midinguinal point, which is on the inguinal ligament midway between the pubic symphysis and the anterior superior iliac spine. The lower transverse line is drawn between the tubercles of the iliac crests (intertubercular plane) and the upper transverse line is in the transpyloric plane (p. 312), midway between the jugular notch and the top of the pubic symphysis (although some clinicians use the subcostal plane which is a little lower - level with the lowest part of the costal margin). Using these four lines, three central regions are defined from above downwards: epigastric, umbilical and hypogastric (or suprapubic). Similarly there are three lateral regions on each side: hypochondrial, lumbar and iliac.</p><p>Fig. 5.1 Regions of the abdomen.</p><h2 id=anterolateral-abdominal-muscles>Anterolateral Abdominal Muscles
<a class=anchor href=#anterolateral-abdominal-muscles>#</a></h2><p>The three muscle layers of the body wall (p. 242) are separate in the flanks, where they are known as the external oblique, internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles. The layers fuse together ventrally to form the rectus abdominis muscle. For recent comments on the traditional descriptions of muscular aponeuroses as given below, see the description of the rectus sheath on page 299.</p><p>The muscle arises by eight digitations, one from each of the lower eight ribs just lateral to their anterior extremities (Fig. 4.37, p. 288). The lower four slips interdigitate with the costal fibers of latissimus dorsi, the upper four with a corresponding number of the digitations of serratus anterior. From its fleshy origin the muscle fans out to a very wide insertion, much of which is aponeurotic. The muscle has three borders: a posterior muscular and upper and lower aponeurotic. The first two lie free.</p><p>Starting from behind at the twelfth rib the muscle may be traced to its insertion as fleshy fibers into the anterior half of the outer lip of the iliac crest. At the anterior superior iliac spine the muscular fibers give way to an aponeurosis; indeed no flesh is to be found below a line joining this point to the umbilicus (Fig. 5.2). The limit of the fleshy fibers is visible in an athlete as a graceful curve. The aponeurotic fibers, directed obliquely downwards and forwards, are attached to the pubic tubercle and, interdigitating with each other above the pubic symphysis, cross the front of the rectus abdominis to the whole length of the linea alba up to the xiphisternum. The free upper border of this aponeurosis, extending from the fifth rib to the xiphisternum, runs horizontally. It is the only structure in the anterior sheath of the rectus muscle above the costal margin. From it arise the lowermost fibers of pectoralis major. The lower border, lying between the anterior superior iliac spine and the pubic tubercle, forms the inguinal ligament.</p><p>The posterior border of the muscle is free, and forms the anterior boundary of the lumbar triangle (of Petit) that is floored in by the internal oblique and bounded behind by the anterior border of latissimus dorsi and below by the iliac crest. The triangle may be the site of a rare lumbar hernia (Fig. 2.5, p. 58).</p><p>The anterior superior iliac spine to the pubic tubercle. Its edge is rolled inwards to form a gutter; the lateral part of this gutter gives origin to part of the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles. To the inguinal ligament is attached the fascia lata of the thigh. When the thigh is extended the fascia lata pulls the inguinal ligament downwards into a gentle convexity.</p><p>Just above and lateral to the pubic tubercle is an oblique V-shaped gap, the superficial inguinal ring, in the aponeurosis (Fig. 5.3). This gap extends down to the pubic crest, medial to the tubercle; the aponeurosis is attached to the pubic crest only in its medial part, alongside the pubic symphysis. From the medial end of the inguinal ligament the lacunar ligament (of Gimbernat) extends backwards to the pectineal line. Its crescentic free edge is the medial margin of the femoral ring. From the pubic tubercle, fibers may be traced upwards and medially, behind the spermatic cord, to interdigitate in the linea alba with those of the opposite side. This is called the reflected part of the ligament (Fig. 5.3). Lastly, near the apex of the superficial inguinal ring are fibers running at right angles to those of the aponeurosis, the intercrural fibers, that blend and prevent the crura from separating (Figs 5.3 and 5.4).</p><p>Fig. 5.3 Left superficial inguinal ring, after removal of the external spermatic fascia which is continuous with the margins of the ring.</p><p>Fig. 5.4 Left conjoint tendon and lacunar ligament. The lowest fibers of the internal oblique arise from the inguinal ligament and arch medially to reach the conjoint tendon, forming as they do so the roof of the inguinal canal. They cover up the similar fibers of transversus abdominis, shown in Figure 5.5. Note that the nearly vertical conjoint tendon lies at right angles to the nearly horizontal lacunar ligament.</p><p>The fleshy fibers arise from the whole length of the lumbar fascia, from the intermediate area of the anterior two-thirds of the iliac crest and from the lateral two-thirds of the inguinal ligament (the rolled-in lower border of the external oblique aponeurosis). From the lumbar fascia the muscle fibers run upwards along the costal margin, to which they are attached, becoming aponeurotic at the tip of the ninth costal cartilage. Below the costal margin, the aponeurosis splits around the rectus muscle, the two layers rejoining at the linea alba. The tendinous intersections of the rectus muscle are adherent to the anterior layer. At a point 2.5 cm (1 in) below the umbilicus the posterior layer ends in a curved free margin, concave downwards, the arcuate line or semicircular line (of Douglas). Below this point, the aponeurosis passes wholly in front of the rectus muscle, to the linea alba (Fig. 5.2) (but see p. 299).</p><p>The muscle fibers that arise from the inguinal ligament are continued into an aponeurosis that is attached to the crest of the pubic bone and, more laterally, to the pectineal line. The internal oblique has thus a free lower border, which arches over the spermatic cord - laterally the margin consists of muscle fibers in front of the cord; medially the margin consists of tendinous fibers behind the cord. The flat tendon, attached to the pectineal line, is fused with a similar arrangement of the transversus aponeurosis to form the conjoint tendon (Fig. 5.4).</p><p>The muscle has a very long origin, in continuity from the whole costal margin, lumbar fascia, iliac crest and inguinal ligament. From the costal margin a fleshy slip arises inside each costal cartilage, interdigitating with the costal origin of the diaphragm; in continuity with the lowest costal fibers the muscle arises from the lumbar fascia lateral to the quadratus lumborum, then from the internal lip of the iliac crest in front of this (the anterior two-thirds of the crest), from the fascia over iliacus and from the lateral half of the inguinal ligament, deep to the internal oblique. The muscle fibers become aponeurotic and pass behind the rectus to fuse with the internal oblique aponeurosis into the linea alba. Below the arcuate line (see under internal oblique muscle) the aponeurosis passes wholly in front of the rectus muscle, behind the aponeurosis of the internal oblique, which it accompanies laterally as the conjoint tendon on the pubic crest and along the pectineal line behind the spermatic cord (Fig. 5.5).</p><p>Rectus abdominis arises by two heads: a medial from in front of the pubic symphysis and a lateral from the upper border of the pubic crest by a relatively small tendon, but the belly rapidly thickens. The two muscles lie edge to edge in the lower part, but broaden out above, and are there separated from each other by the linea alba (Fig. 5.2). They are inserted into the thoracic cage. The bulk of the muscle passes in front of the costal cartilages and is attached to the fifth to seventh cartilages. This represents the external oblique layer (Fig. 5.6). Some of the fibers are inserted into the costal margin (i.e. the lower border of the seventh costal cartilage) representing the internal oblique layer. The transversus layer is represented by the xiphisternal fibers of the diaphragm (Fig. 5.6). Typically three tendinous intersections are found in the muscle, one at the umbilicus, one at the xiphisternum, and one between these two.</p><p>Fig. 5.5 Left transversus abdominis, showing the lowest fibers arching medially to join the conjoint tendon.</p><p>Fig. 5.6 Upper attachments of rectus abdominis, from the left, showing the three morphological layers of the muscle. External indicates the external oblique layer passing over the fifth, sixth and seventh costal cartilages; internal is the intermediate layer attached to the costal margin. The xiphisternal fibers of the diaphragm represent the innermost layer.</p><p>The muscle is formed by fusion of mesodermal somites as indicated by its regular segmental innervation but the tendinous intersections do not represent lines of fusion of myotomes; they are later developments and are sometimes found below the umbilicus. The tendinous intersections interchange fibers to blend inseparably with the anterior layer of the rectus sheath (see below). They occupy only the superficial part of the rectus and do not penetrate to the posterior surface of the muscle, which is thus not connected to the posterior layer of the sheath. The contracting rectus abdominis can be seen as bulgings between the tendinous intersections in an individual who is not too fat.</p><p>Between the two recti all the aponeuroses fuse to form the linea alba, a strong midline fibrous structure which is firmly attached to the xiphoid process above and the pubic symphysis below (Fig. 5.2). Above the symphysis it is very narrow, for here the two recti are in contact with one another behind it. From just below the umbilicus to the xiphisternum it broadens out between the recti. Here the fibers form a tough felted membrane.</p><p>The aponeurosis of the internal oblique splits into anterior and posterior layers to enclose the rectus muscle (Fig. 5.7B). The external oblique aponeurosis fuses with the anterior layer to form the anterior layer of the sheath, and the transversus aponeurosis fuses with the posterior layer to form the posterior layer of the sheath. A little below the umbilicus this arrangement ceases, and from this level downwards all three aponeuroses pass in front of the muscle (Fig. 5.7C). There is thus a free lower margin to the posterior layer; it is concave (though often ill-defined - see below) and properly named the arcuate line but sometimes known as the semicircular line (of Douglas). Below the umbilicus the aponeuroses of internal oblique and transversus fuse completely but that of the external oblique fuses only to the most medial part of the sheath. The posterior layer of the sheath is attached to the costal margin (seventh, eighth and ninth costal cartilages). At the front the rectus muscle passes over the costal margin to become attached to the fifth, sixth and seventh cartilages, as does the overlying external oblique aponeurosis, so that in this region the anterior layer of the sheath consists only of the external oblique aponeurosis (Fig. 5.7A).</p><p>Fig. 5.7 Formation of the rectus sheath as seen in horizontal sections. A Above the costal margin; only the external oblique and its aponeurosis exist here. B Between the umbilicus and the costal margin; the aponeurosis of the internal oblique splits around the rectus, taking the external oblique aponeurosis to join the anterior layer and that of transversus to join the posterior layer. C Below the arcuate line; all three aponeuroses pass in front of the rectus muscle. See text for other possibilities.</p><p>And decussation of fibers between adjacent layers, as far down as the umbilicus. There is no well-defined arcuate line but a gradual diminution of aponeurotic fibers with increasing thickness of the transversalis fascia. For many students and practitioners the old concepts may still be adequate, although new ideas about fiber patterns may be significant for movements of the thoracic walls and vertebral column. The lower thickened part of the transversalis fascia, between the iliac crest and pubis, is called the iliopubic tract by some authorities, who consider this and not the lacunar ligament to be the medial boundary of the femoral ring (p. 154).</p><p><strong>Contents.</strong> Apart from the rectus and pyramidalis muscles, the sheath contains the ends of the lower six thoracic nerves and their accompanying posterior intercostal vessels, and the superior and inferior epigastric arteries.</p><p>The posterior intercostal nerves (T7-11, p. 246) pass from their intercostal spaces into the abdominal wall between the internal oblique and transversus muscles, and run round in this neurovascular plane to enter the sheath by piercing the posterior layer of the internal oblique aponeurosis. They then proceed behind the rectus muscle to about its midline (Fig. 5.2) where they pierce the muscle, supply it, and pass through the anterior layer of the sheath to become the anterior cutaneous nerves. In the sheath T7 runs upwards just below the costal margin, T8 transversely and the others obliquely downwards. Well before they reach the sheath the nerves have given off their lateral cutaneous branches, which pierce the internal and external oblique in order to reach the skin. Note that it is these lateral cutaneous branches which supply the external oblique.</p><p>The superior epigastric artery, a terminal branch of the internal thoracic (p. 248), enters the sheath by passing between the sternal and highest costal fibers of the diaphragm. It supplies the rectus muscle and anastomoses within it with the inferior epigastric artery. This vessel leaves the external iliac at the inguinal ligament (Fig. 5.10), passes upwards behind the conjoint tendon, slips over the semicircular fold and so enters the sheath. Veins accompany these arteries, draining to internal thoracic and external iliac veins respectively.</p><h2 id=blood-supplies>Blood Supplies
<a class=anchor href=#blood-supplies>#</a></h2><p>Apart from the thoracic and epigastric vessels mentioned above, the anterolateral abdominal muscles also receive a blood supply from the lumbar and deep circumflex iliac arteries. The lumbar arteries are described on page 360; they end among the flat anterolateral muscles and do not reach the rectus sheath.</p><p>The deep circumflex iliac artery (p. 360) arises from the external iliac behind the inguinal ligament (Fig. 5.10), and runs laterally towards the anterior superior iliac spine in a canal of tissue where the transversalis and iliac fasciae meet. It continues along the inner lip of the iliac crest and pierces the transversus muscle to reach the neurovascular plane and anastomose with branches of the iliolumbar and superior gluteal arteries. At the anterior superior iliac spine it gives off an ascending branch which enters the neurovascular plane to anastomose with the inferior epigastric and lumbar arteries. This branch may be at risk in a gridiron incision (p. 311).</p><p>The superficial tissues of the anterolateral abdominal wall drain in quadrants: to the pectoral group of axillary nodes above the umbilicus on each side, and to superficial inguinal nodes below that level. The deeper parts of the wall drain into vessels in the extraperitoneal tissues. Above the umbilicus these pierce the diaphragm to reach mediastinal nodes, and below it they run to the external iliac and para-aortic nodes. There are, rather surprisingly, no lymph nodes in the abdominal wall to correspond to the intercostal nodes of the thoracic wall.</p><h2 id=nerve-supplies>Nerve Supplies
<a class=anchor href=#nerve-supplies>#</a></h2><p>The rectus muscle and external oblique are both supplied by the lower intercostal and subcostal nerves (T7-T12; for their courses see below), and the internal oblique and transversus by those same nerves but with the addition of the iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves (L1). It is the lowest fibers of the internal oblique and transversus - those that form the conjoint tendon that receive the L1 innervation, which is thus responsible for helping to maintain the integrity of the inguinal canal (p. 304). The unimportant pyramidalis is supplied by the subcostal nerve (T12).</p><h2 id=actions-of-abdominal-muscles>Actions of Abdominal Muscles
<a class=anchor href=#actions-of-abdominal-muscles>#</a></h2><p>The muscles of the anterior abdominal wall play four main roles: (1) to move the trunk, (2) to depress the ribs (expiration), (3) to compress the abdomen (evacuation, expiration, heavy lifting) and (4) to support the viscera (intestines only). The abdominal wall, moving to and fro with breathing, conforms to the volume of the abdominal contents. Its shape is determined by the tonus of its own muscles. The subumbilical pull of healthy flank muscles keeps its lower part flat by holding back the lower recti.</p><p><strong>Moving the trunk.</strong> It must be remembered that the muscles are attached to the thoracic cage and the bony pelvis; evidently their action is to approximate the two. They are the great flexor muscles of the vertebral column in its lumbar and lower thoracic parts. Rectus abdominis is the most powerful flexor, but all four oblique muscles, acting symmetrically, are important partners. The oblique muscles themselves (but not transversus) are abductors and rotators of the trunk. The external oblique of one side acts with the internal oblique of the other side to do this, an indispensable postural adjunct to almost all one-armed movements (e.g. tennis, boxing, etc.).</p><p><strong>Depressing the ribs.</strong> The recti and obliques (but not transversus) approximate the ribs to the pelvic girdle. If erector spinae prevents thoracolumbar flexion this provides a powerful expiratory force (e.g. coughing, blowing the trumpet, speech-making). Added to this is the abdominal compression (aided by transversus) that elevates the diaphragm to increase the expiratory effort.</p><p><strong>Compressing the abdomen.</strong> Flexion of the vertebral column is prevented by the erector spinae muscles. The oblique muscles compress the abdominal cavity; in this they are aided strongly by transversus abdominis, which has no flexing action on the spine. The recti play little part in compression. If the diaphragm is relaxed, it is forced up, and this is discussed with expiration on page 251. At the same time levator ani helps to hold the pelvic effluents closed. The reverse occurs in evacuation of the pelvic effluents. Here the diaphragm contracts to resist upward displacement, but it is a far weaker muscle than the abdominal wall, and in forceful compression it is prevented from rising by holding the breath (i.e. by closure of the glottis, and of perhaps the mouth and nasopharynx). This is discussed on page 502.</p><p><strong>Supporting and protecting viscera.</strong> If the anterior abdominal wall is incised or removed, only the intestines spill out. At most the wall helps to support the intestines, suspended by their mesenteries; the upper abdominal viscera such as the liver, spleen and kidneys do not require the wall for this purpose, but reflex contraction in response to a blow helps to protect all viscera.</p><p><strong>Tests.</strong> Rectus abdominis can be tested by lying flat on the back and raising the head (without using the arms). There are no specific tests for the other flat muscles, but the abdominal reflex and Beevor&rsquo;s sign have been referred to on page 29.</p><p>The inguinal canal is an oblique intermuscular slit about 6 cm (over 2 in) long lying above the medial half of the inguinal ligament. It commences at the deep inguinal ring, ends at the superficial inguinal ring, and transmits the spermatic cord and ilioinguinal nerve in the male and the round ligament of the uterus and ilioinguinal nerve in the female. Its anterior wall is formed by the external oblique aponeurosis (Fig. 5.8), assisted laterally by a portion of the internal oblique muscle (Fig. 5.9). Its floor is the inrolled lower edge of the inguinal ligament, reinforced medially by the lacunar ligament (Fig. 5.4) and fusing more laterally with the transversalis fascia. Its roof is formed by the lower edges of the internal oblique and transversus muscles, which arch over from in front of the cord laterally to behind the cord medially, where their conjoined aponeuroses, constituting the conjoint tendon, are inserted into the pubic crest and the pectineal line of the pubic bone. The posterior wall of the canal is formed by the strong conjoint tendon medially and the weak transversalis fascia laterally.</p><p>Fig. 5.9 Right inguinal canal after division of the external oblique aponeurosis and fasciae.</p><p>The fibers of the external oblique aponeurosis run parallel with their lower border, the inguinal ligament. Above its medial end they diverge from each other to make a V-shaped opening, the superficial inguinal ring (Fig. 5.3). The lateral crus of this opening is attached to the pubic tubercle, the medial crus to the pubic crest near the symphysis. The intervening part of the pubic crest receives no attachment from the external oblique aponeurosis and forms the base of the ring which is triangular, not circular. At the point of junction of the crura are shining strands, the intercrural fibers (Fig. 5.3), running at right angles across the external oblique aponeurosis. They bind the crura together, and serve as a visible landmark for the superficial ring at operation (Fig. 5.8).</p><p>The crura can be demonstrated only by sharp dissection, cutting the external spermatic fascia free. Due to the obliquity of the superficial ring, the cord, which passes vertically downwards after emerging therefrom, overlies the pubic tubercle. For this reason the pubic tubercle is not readily palpable from in front, and for the satisfaction of the examiner and the comfort of the subject, should be palpated in the living by a finger that invaginates the scrotum behind the cord. From the attachment of the lateral crus (i.e. the pubic tubercle) some fibers, forming the reflected part of the inguinal ligament, pass upwards behind the cord and behind the medial crus to blend in the rectus sheath with those from the opposite side (p. 297). They constitute an additional attachment, a posterior crus, of the aponeurosis of the opposite external oblique.</p><p>The anterior wall of the inguinal canal is reinforced laterally by the lowest muscle fibers of the internal oblique. The deep inguinal ring lies above the midpoint of the inguinal ligament; the internal oblique fibers extend medial to this, for they arise from the lateral two-thirds of the ligament (Figs 5.4 and 5.9).</p><p>Hold a hip bone in the position it occupies during life, with the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic symphysis in the same vertical plane. Picture the inguinal ligament, joining anterior superior spine to pubic tubercle. Note that the pectineal line of the pubic bone lies superior to it. Thus the lacunar ligament filling the angle between inguinal ligament and pectineal line, passes upwards from the ligament to the bone. Its abdominal surface faces forwards as well as upwards. Its femoral surface faces backwards as well as downwards. It lies in the floor of the inguinal canal (Fig. 5.4). Lateral to its attachment the incurved edge of the inguinal ligament forms a gutter which floors in the inguinal canal. The transversalis fascia is fused with this part of the inguinal ligament.</p><p>This is formed by the arched lower borders of the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles (Figs 5.4 and 5.5). Each arises from the hollow of the inrolled lower edge of the inguinal ligament, but their precise attachments need to be appreciated separately. The internal oblique muscle arises by fleshy fibers from the lateral two-thirds of the inguinal ligament. The fibers arch medially and downwards, merging into a flat aponeurosis. The most lateral fibers, those arising from just below the anterior superior iliac spine, arch downwards to reach the pubic symphysis, in front of rectus abdominis. The remaining fibers (trace them medially along their origin at the inguinal ligament) arch concentrically within the former, passing in front of rectus abdominis along the pubic crest as far as the pubic tubercle and then extending laterally along the pectineal line as far as the crescentic edge of the lacunar ligament (Fig. 5.4). These lateral fibers, joining the underlying transversus aponeurosis, constitute with them the conjoint tendon. The transversus abdominis lies more laterally at its origin, coming from only the lateral half of the inguinal ligament, by fleshy fibers deep to those of the internal oblique. They rapidly become tendinous and, fusing with the aponeurosis of the internal oblique, form the conjoint tendon which is attached along the pubic crest and extends laterally along the pectineal line (Fig. 5.10). Note that the conjoint tendon and the lacunar ligament, attached in common to the pectineal line, lie in planes at right angles to each other. The deep inguinal ring lies in the angle between the edge of transversus and the inguinal ligament. Since the internal oblique muscle arises a little more medially than this, it lies in front of the deep ring. The muscular arch of the roof, starting in the anterior wall of the canal, passes over the cord and, becoming tendinous, passes down behind the cord, in the posterior wall of the canal, to reach the pectineal line. Note the oblique course of the canal through the muscular layers of the abdominal wall; it is the obliquity of the canal which gives it strength.</p><p>Fig. 5.10 Left inguinal region viewed from within the abdomen. The deep inguinal ring lies lateral to the inferior epigastric artery. The femoral ring lies medial to the external iliac (femoral) vein; the lacunar ligament which is at the medial border of the ring is here obscured by the conjoint tendon.</p><p>Versus are supplied by the iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves (L1). Their contraction tightens the conjoint tendon and lowers the roof of the canal, like pulling down a shutter. Thus division of the ilioinguinal nerve above this level (as in a split-muscle incision for appendicectomy) leads to a direct inguinal hernia - the conjoint tendon bulges when intra-abdominal pressure rises. Note that damage to the ilioinguinal nerve as it lies in the inguinal canal does not paralyze these fibers; at this level the nerve is purely sensory, having already given off its motor fibers, and injury here will only cause some sensory loss over the anterior part of the scrotum (labium majus) and adjacent thigh.</p><h2 id=posterior-wall-and-deep-inguinal-ring>Posterior Wall and Deep Inguinal Ring
<a class=anchor href=#posterior-wall-and-deep-inguinal-ring>#</a></h2><p>Medially the posterior wall consists of the strong conjoint tendon, as already explained. Lateral to the conjoint tendon the wall is only thin, the gap between the arched roof (internal oblique and transversus muscles) and the floor (the inguinal ligament) being covered over by the weak areolar tissue of the transversalis fascia and peritoneum. The integrity of the inguinal canal depends upon the strength of the anterior wall in the lateral part and of the posterior wall in the medial part, and provided the abdominal muscles are of good tone and their aponeuroses unyielding no direct herniation of viscera can take place. The deep and superficial inguinal rings lie at opposite ends of the inguinal canal, 6 cm (2.5 in) from each other, and the intervening part of the canal is pressed flat when the aponeuroses are under tension and the intra-abdominal pressure raised. The transversalis fascia in the posterior wall is strengthened, moreover, by the presence in front of it of certain tendinous, and sometimes muscular, fibers derived from the transversus abdominis muscle. These fibers constitute the interfoveolar ligament (Fig. 5.10). They arch down from the lower border of transversus around the vas to the inguinal ligament, and constitute the functional medial edge of the deep ring. They extend for a variable distance medially across the posterior wall of the inguinal canal and contain a variable amount of muscle fibers. The muscle is well developed in animals that withdraw the testis from the scrotum during their winter of sexual inactivity (e.g. the Canadian moose).</p><p>The deep inguinal ring lies above the midpoint of the inguinal ligament and is an opening in the transversalis fascia bounded laterally by the angle between the transversus muscle fibers and the inguinal ligament (Fig. 5.10). Its medial border is the transversalis fascia where this structure is projected along the canal, like a sleeve from the armhole of a coat, as the internal.</p><p>Like the superficial ring, the deep inguinal ring (Fig. 5.10) is only a true gap when fascia, in this case the internal spermatic fascia, is cut away from its margins. Passing through the ring are the vas (ductus) deferens, and its artery (from the superior or inferior vesical), the testicular artery and the accompanying veins (usually double at this level), the obliterated remains of the processus vaginalis, autonomic nerves and lymphatics. Note that the ilioinguinal nerve, although classified as one of the contents of the inguinal canal (together with the spermatic cord or round ligament of the uterus), does not enter the canal through the deep ring but does so via the anterior wall of the canal by running between the external oblique aponeurosis and the internal oblique muscle, i.e. it slips into the canal from the side, not from the back. The nerve is not one of the constituents of the cord but runs in front of it. It leaves the canal through the superficial ring and supplies skin of the inguinal region, upper part of the thigh and anterior third of the scrotum (or labium majus).</p><h2 id=structures-deep-to-the-posterior-wall>Structures Deep to the Posterior Wall
<a class=anchor href=#structures-deep-to-the-posterior-wall>#</a></h2><p>Crossing the posterior wall at the medial edge of the deep inguinal ring is the inferior epigastric artery. Lateral to the artery the ductus deferens in the male and the round ligament of the uterus in the female enter the canal by hooking around the interfoveolar ligament (Fig. 5.11). The artery is a branch of the external iliac just proximal to the inguinal ligament. It arises deep to the fascia transversalis, which it perforates obliquely as it slants upwards and medially. Lying superficial to the transversalis fascia the artery now passes over the arcuate line to enter the rectus sheath behind the muscle. At the deep ring the inferior epigastric artery gives off the cremasteric branch to supply that muscle and the coverings of the cord. The area bounded laterally by the inferior epigastric artery, medially by the lateral border of the rectus muscle, and below by the inguinal ligament is the inguinal triangle (of Hesselbach). By definition a hernial sac passing lateral to the artery (i.e. through the deep ring) is an indirect hernia, one passing medial to the artery (through the inguinal triangle) is a direct hernia; the latter stretches out the conjoint tendon over itself and is therefore seldom large. (A femoral hernia enters the femoral canal through the femoral ring, below the inguinal ligament and lateral to the lacunar ligament - p. 154.) The inferior epigastric artery also gives off a pubic branch to the periosteum of the superior pubic ramus.</p><p>Fig. 5.11 Left femoral ring and adjacent structures, from behind. The accessory obturator artery is here lying at the medial margin of the femoral ring (lateral edge of the lacunar ligament) - the dangerous position if the ligament has to be incised to reduce a strangulated femoral hernia.</p><p>This anastomoses with the pubic branch of the obturator artery. If the obturator artery is absent, this anastomosis is opened up to form the accessory or abnormal obturator artery, which is present in about 50% of individuals (p. 396). The obliterated umbilical artery, known in the adult as the medial umbilical ligament (p. 313), passes obliquely across the posterior wall of the inguinal canal, medial to the inferior epigastric artery (Fig. 5.2).</p><p>The ductus deferens and accompanying structures are conventionally considered as passing through the deep inguinal ring and along the inguinal canal to the superficial ring, picking up coverings from the layers of the abdominal wall as they do so (but as far as the passage of semen is concerned, the movement is of course in the opposite direction). All these structures make up the spermatic cord, whose components may be considered under two headings: the three coverings of the cord, and its six (groups of) constituents.</p><p>Of the three coverings (Fig. 5.12), the internal spermatic fascia is the investment derived from the transversalis fascia at the deep inguinal ring. As the cord passes through the ring into the inguinal canal, it picks up a second covering, the cremasteric fascia and cremaster muscle, from the internal oblique and transversus aponeuroses and muscles. The transversus muscle fibers spiral down the cord and return behind it to become attached to the pubic tubercle. The internal oblique fibers, a larger contribution, also spiral around the cord and some return to the pubic tubercle but most return to the internal oblique itself. The third covering is from the crura of the superficial ring (external oblique aponeurosis), the external spermatic fascia. Strictly speaking the cord is only complete as it acquires this outer covering on emerging from the superficial ring.</p><p>The cremaster muscle can elevate the testis towards or even into the inguinal canal; although the fibers are skeletal the action is reflex rather than voluntary. This cremasteric reflex is particularly active in the infant and child and must be borne in mind when examining the scrotum in the young, to avoid an erroneous diagnosis of undescended testis.</p><p>(1) The ductus deferens, which usually lies in the lower and posterior part of the cord.
(2) Arteries, the largest of which is the testicular artery (see below), with the artery to the ductus (from the superior or inferior vesical), and the cremasteric artery (from the inferior epigastric, Fig. 5.10) to the coverings.
(3) Veins — the pampiniform plexus (see below).
(4) Lymphatics, essentially those accompanying the veins from the testis to para-aortic nodes, but including some from the coverings which drain to external iliac nodes.
(5) Nerves, in particular the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve which runs among the coverings to supply the cremaster muscle, and is classified as part of the spermatic cord and not as a separate structure running through the inguinal canal. Other nerves are sympathetic twigs which accompany the arteries.
(6) The processus vaginalis, the obliterated remains of the peritoneal connection with the tunica vaginalis of the testis (and the constituent of the cord most commonly forgotten!). When patent it forms the sac of an indirect inguinal hernia (Fig. 5.13).</p><p>The testis (Fig. 5.12) is an oval organ possessing a thick covering of fibrous tissue, the tunica albuginea. To its posterolateral surface the epididymis is attached - an important point to remember when trying to distinguish between swellings of these two structures. The vas (ductus deferens) is the direct continuation of the epididymis (p. 308) and lies medial to it, the continuity being with its lower pole. The front and lateral surfaces of the testis lie free in a serous space formed by the overlying tunica vaginalis, a remnant of the fetal processus vaginalis. This serous membrane covers also the anterolateral part of the epididymis. In hydrocele of the testis the space of the tunica vaginalis becomes distended with fluid. A slit-like space, the sinus of the epididymis, which lies between testis and epididymis, is thus within the tunica vaginalis. Testis, epididymis and tunica vaginalis lie in the scrotum surrounded by thin membranes, adherent to each other, that are downward prolongations of the coverings of the spermatic cord. Right and left sides are separated by the median scrotal septum. The appendix testis is a sessile cyst 2 or 3 mm in diameter attached to the upper pole of the testis within the tunica vaginalis. It is part of the remains of the paramesonephric duct (p. 309).</p><h2 id=blood-supply>Blood Supply
<a class=anchor href=#blood-supply>#</a></h2><p>The testicular artery, from the aorta, runs in the spermatic cord, gives off a branch to the epididymis, and reaches the back of the testis, where it divides into medial and lateral branches. These do not penetrate the mediastinum testis, but sweep around horizontally within the tunica albuginea. Branches from these vessels penetrate the substance of the organ. Venules reach the mediastinum, from which several veins pass upwards in the spermatic cord and surround the testicular artery with a mass of intercommunicating veins, the pampiniform plexus. On its way to the testis and on the surface of the organ before entering it, the artery and its branches are intimately related to the venous plexus in order to provide a countercurrent heat exchange; for spermatogenesis the testis has to function at a temperature 2-4°C lower then rectal temperature. In the region of the epididymis there is an anastomosis between the testicular, cremasteric and ductal arteries. If the main artery is divided, the smaller vessels may not completely sustain the testis; atrophy may occur, though ischemic necrosis is unlikely. In the inguinal canal the plexus may have separated out into about four veins which join to form two that leave the deep inguinal ring, perhaps becoming single on psoas major on the posterior abdominal wall (p. 361). The left vein invariably joins the left renal vein and the right is said to drain directly into the inferior vena cava, but it joins the right renal vein more commonly than most textbooks suggest. Varicocele (varicosities of the pampiniform and cremasteric veins) occurs much more frequently on the left side than the right, for reasons which are obscure. The only valves in the plexus and main veins are at the upper ends of the veins though the left vein is more often valveless than the right.</p><h2 id=lymph-drainage>Lymph Drainage
<a class=anchor href=#lymph-drainage>#</a></h2><p>Within the testis, lymphatic capillaries lie between, not within, the seminiferous tubules. Lymphatics run back with the testicular artery to para-aortic nodes lying alongside the aorta at the level of origin of the testicular arteries (L2 vertebra), i.e. just above the umbilicus. The testicular lymph therefore does not drain to inguinal nodes, although the overlying scrotal skin does.</p><p>The testis is supplied by sympathetic nerves. Most of the connector cells lie in T10 segment of the cord. Passing in the greater or lesser splanchnic nerve to the celiac ganglion the efferent fibers synapse there. Postganglionic grey fibers reach the testis along the testicular artery. Sensory fibers (testicular sensation) share the same sympathetic pathway. They run up along the testicular artery and through the celiac plexus and lesser splanchnic nerve and its white ramus to cell bodies in the posterior root ganglion of T10 spinal nerve. There is no parasympathetic supply to the testis.</p><h2 id=structure>Structure
<a class=anchor href=#structure>#</a></h2><p>The upper pole of the epididymis is attached high up on the posterolateral surface of the testis. Here there is a fibrous mass, the mediastinum testis, from which septa radiate to reach the tunica albuginea. The septa divide the testis into some 400 lobules, each of which contains two (sometimes three or four) highly convoluted seminiferous tubules. Each tubule is 60 cm (2 ft) long. The tubules lie rather loosely between the tunica albuginea and fibrous septa so that the cut surface of the organ bulges with herniating tubules. The seminiferous tubules open into the rete testis, which is a network of intercommunicating channels lying in the mediastinum testis. From the rete the vasa efferentia, 15 to 20 in number, enter the commencement of the canal of the epididymis, thus attaching the head of the epididymis to the testis.</p><p>Histological sections of the mature testis are easily recognized. The dense fibrous tissue of the tunica albuginea is thick, and fibrous septa divide the field into loculi. The seminiferous tubules, convoluted within the loculi, are cut in multiple sections. Each tubule shows several layers of cells. The outermost layer consists of spermatogonia, which divide to produce the cells of the next layer or two, the primary spermatocytes - the largest of the germ-cell series. These divide by meiosis, halving the chromosome number, to form secondary spermatocytes which are rarely identified because they have a very short life and divide almost immediately to form spermatids. These do not divide but undergo a metamorphosis into spermatozoa. The whole process of producing spermatozoa from spermatogonia is spermatogenesis and takes 64-70 days; the transformation of spermatids into spermatozoa is spermiogenesis. Different parts of a tubule show germ cells at different stages of development.</p><p>Among the developing germ cells are the supporting or sustentacular cells (of Sertoli). By their many branching processes which adhere to one another (but not as a syncytium) they form an anastomosing network within which the germ cells are embedded, an arrangement that is only apparent on electron microscopy. The Sertoli cells secrete an androgen binding protein (ABP) which keeps a high concentration of testosterone in the germ cell environment.</p><h2 id=descent-of-the-testis>Descent of the Testis
<a class=anchor href=#descent-of-the-testis>#</a></h2><p>By the end of the fourth month of fetal life the primitive testis (derived from the gonadal ridge medial to the mesonephric ridge of the intermediate cell mass, p. 36) lies near the deep inguinal ring (Fig. 5.13), connected to that region of the anterior abdominal wall by a peritoneal fold. By the seventh month it is in the deep inguinal ring, and in the course of a few days during the next few weeks it progresses rapidly through the inguinal canal into the scrotum - this is descent of the testis (the term does not mean movement down the posterior abdominal wall; growth of the trunk carries the kidney and suprarenal upwards, away from the testis). An elongated diverticulum of the peritoneal cavity, the processus vaginalis (Figs 5.13 and 5.14), has preceded the testis through the inguinal canal into the scrotum, and the testis moves down behind this. The processus normally becomes obliterated, except at the lower end where the testis bulges into it from behind and blends at its margins to form the tunica albuginea. The so-called visceral layer of the tunica vaginalis is testicular rather than coelomic in origin, in the same way that the surface epithelium of the ovary blends with the surrounding peritoneum (like the corneal epithelium with the conjunctiva).</p><p>Fig. 5.13 Descent of the testis. A A 6-month fetus with the testis adjacent to the anterior abdominal wall near the deep inguinal ring. The ductus deferens descends from the lower pole (tail) of the epididymis. B In a neonatal specimen the gubernaculum is under the testis in the scrotum, and the ductus recurves from the tail of the epididymis behind the processus vaginalis of peritoneum. C With descent completed, the gubernaculum and processus vaginalis have disappeared. If the processus persists as a patent tube it provides a preformed hernial sac, as in the infantile type of congenital inguinal hernia.</p><p>Although the endocrine control of descent is reasonably well defined, the mechanism of descent is still not clear. It appears that the enlarging epididymis, attached to the testis before and during its descent, helps to push the testis down. The descent into the scrotum is preceded by the gubernaculum (a mesodermal condensation at the lower end of the gonad) which swells by the imbibition of water to enlarge a passage for descent. Contrary to earlier opinions, the gubernaculum does not become attached to the bottom of the scrotum and does not pull the testis down. However, it does appear to play an important role, possibly by preventing closure of the inguinal canal or directing the course of descent. Aberrant strands of gubernaculum may be associated with a testis in unusual sites (ectopic testis) in the inguinal or femoral regions or the perineum, but a causal relationship is not proven.</p><p>Failure to descend may result in cryptorchid testis, where it remains in the abdomen, or descent may be arrested anywhere from the deep inguinal ring downwards. Undescended testes are peculiarly liable to malignant disease; spermatogenesis is defective or absent but androgenic activity is not. They must be distinguished from retracted testes, where the cremaster muscle draws them back into the canal, especially in the young under the influence of cold examining hands! Failure of obliteration of the whole processus vaginalis gives rise to the congenital type of indirect inguinal hernia; localized persistence of part of the processus forms hydrocele of the cord. In the much commoner hydrocele of the testis, fluid fills the cavity of the tunica vaginalis.</p><p>The epididymis is a firm structure, attached behind the testis, with the ductus deferens to its medial side. It consists of a single tube, 7 m (24 ft) long, highly coiled and packed together by fibrous tissue. The mass so resulting has a large head (upper pole, globus major) and a small tail (lower pole, globus minor) connected by the intervening body, which is applied in crescentic manner to the posterolateral part of the testis. A narrow slit between epididymis and testis is the sinus of the epididymis. The sinus, with the anterior half of the epididymis, lies within the tunica vaginalis. The head receives the vasa efferentia from the rete testis and is thus firmly attached to the testis. Elsewhere the epididymis has no functional connection with the testis, but it is firmly bound to it by fibrous tissue. It is an organ for the storage and maturation of spermatozoa.</p><p>From the tail the ductus (vas) deferens, a direct continuation of the canal of the epididymis, provided with a thick wall of smooth muscle, passes up medially. It enters the spermatic cord, passes through the inguinal canal, across the side wall of the pelvis just under the peritoneum, and crosses the pelvic cavity. It pierces the prostate and opens by the ejaculatory duct into the prostatic urethra (p. 385). Its pelvic course is described on page 385.</p><p>A
Fig. 5.14 Stages of testicular descent. A In the fetus, the testis projects through the peritoneum into the coelomic cavity. The ductus deferens (mesonephric duct) runs downwards. B In the neonate, the testis has reached the scrotum together with the tube-like prolongation of the peritoneal cavity, the processus vaginalis. C The end result, with the testis partly surrounded by the tunica vaginalis derived from the processus, and the rest of the processus reduced to a fibrous cord.</p><p>The epididymis is supplied, like the testis, by sympathetic fibers from the celiac ganglion via the testicular artery.</p><p>Histological sections of the epididymis are easily recognized. One single coiled tube is cut many times; circles, ovals or comma-shaped outlines of a constant diameter are seen. The wall is of thin fibrous tissue, and the lining is of tall columnar epithelium with stereocilia, which are not true cilia but long, non-motile microvilli. Fibrous tissue binds the coils together.</p><p>The ductus deferens, or vas, is characteristic. Its wall is very thick in contrast to the narrow lumen. The thick wall is of visceral muscle, typically arranged in three layers - middle circular and inner and outer longitudinal - but there is often interweaving of fibers. The lining mucous membrane is a thin layer of dense fibrous tissue, surfaced with tall columnar epithelium with stereocilia like that of its parent epididymis.</p><p>The whole length of the single tube constituting the epididymis and ductus is a persistent and much elongated part of the mesonephric (Wolffian) duct of the embryo. This duct receives the efferent tubules of the mesonephros (Fig. 5.15 and p. 370). When the mesonephros is replaced by the metanephros and disappears, some of its tubules persist and attach to the developing testis, forming the vasa efferentia and draining the products of the testis into the commencement of the mesonephric duct. Some mesonephric tubules persist without serving any function of drainage, since they are blind at one or both ends. Thus, above and below the epididymis blind tubules, the vasa aberrantia, open into its canal. Their bulbous blind ends may form small swellings; an upper one is relatively constant, the appendix of the epididymis. Above the epididymis, at the lower extremity of the spermatic cord, a mass of tubules, blind at each end, persists as the paradidymis (organ of Giraldes). A cyst formed from an aberrant vessel will contain spermatozoa and thus be opalescent. A cyst formed from a tubule of the paradidymis cannot contain spermatozoa, and its fluid is thus crystal clear.</p><p>The vas is now renamed the ductus deferens. But sterilization of the male by division and ligation of the tube is still popularly known as vasectomy (more accurately, vasotomy), and has not yet been dubbed a deferential dochotomy. The spermatic cord containing the firm tubular ductus is palpated between the thumb and fingers at the top of the scrotum and a transverse incision made so that the ductus can be dissected out and a small length of it removed. Each remaining cut end is turned back on itself and ligated, and the same procedure is then carried out on the opposite side.</p><h2 id=abdominal-incisions>Abdominal Incisions
<a class=anchor href=#abdominal-incisions>#</a></h2><p>The simplest abdominal incision is the midline incision, above or below the umbilicus, and passing through skin and subcutaneous tissues, the linea alba, transversalis fascia, extraperitoneal fat and peritoneum. No major vessels or nerves are involved, but a few small vessels may cross the midline of the peritoneum. Note that in the lower abdomen the linea alba is very narrow and the two rectus muscles may lie very close together; poor suture technique leads to incisional hernias. In the suprapubic region the bladder must not be damaged. For laparoscopic surgery, the incision for insertion of the needle to induce pneumoperitoneum is usually made in the midline, just above or below the umbilicus, and the instrument is first directed down towards the pelvic cavity to avoid damaging the aorta. Separate incisions are made for other instruments, often lateral to the rectus sheath but not too low, to avoid the inferior epigastric vessels; transillumination from behind helps to avoid them. Other openings can be made above the umbilicus to the left of the midline (to avoid the falciform ligament which lies increasingly towards the right), or in the midclavicular or midaxillary lines nearly level with the umbilicus. Sites below the umbilicus or at the lateral border of the rectus sheath are also used for the insertion of a trocar and cannula for drainage of peritoneal fluid (paracentesis) or for a peritoneal dialysis catheter.</p><p>In a paramedian incision, the anterior wall of the rectus sheath is incised vertically 3 cm from the midline and the rectus muscle either retracted laterally or split so that the posterior wall of the sheath can be incised. The tendinous intersections in the rectus muscle at and above the umbilicus may have to be dissected off the anterior wall of the sheath; they may contain vessels. Above the umbilicus on the right the falciform ligament may have to be divided. If the rectus is split instead of being retracted, the split should not be more than 1 cm from the medial border in order to avoid the intercostal nerves which pierce the muscle near its midline. The small part of the muscle medial to the split will be denervated and devascularized but this does not cause.</p><p>The right subcostal (Kocher&rsquo;s) incision is made 3 cm parallel to and below the right costal margin, from the midline to beyond the lateral border of the rectus sheath. The anterior layer of the sheath (with the external oblique) and the rectus muscle are divided in the line of the skin incision, with ligation of the superior epigastric vessels and/or their branches. The posterior layer of the sheath is then incised, continuing laterally into the internal oblique and transversus and through to the peritoneum. The seventh intercostal nerve follows the costal margin upwards and is usually above the incision line, although the eighth or ninth nerve may have to be cut, with little effect on the rectus muscle. They should be preserved if possible but cutting more than two (paralyzing more of the rectus) should be avoided.</p><p>The gridiron (McBurney&rsquo;s) incision is a right lower oblique muscle-splitting incision, long used for appendicectomy. The skin incision is through the junction of the outer and middle thirds of a line drawn from the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus and can be made either parallel to the iliac crest or transversely. The external oblique muscle and its aponeurosis are divided in the line of the muscle fibers and then the internal oblique and transversus are split transversely (in the line of their own fibers). The two muscles are close and may appear as one; the transversus becomes aponeurotic at this level and adheres to the transversalis fascia. The peritoneum can then be incised. The iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves may be seen between the internal oblique and transversus and must not be damaged, to avoid weakening the protective effect that the muscles exert upon the inguinal canal (p. 304). Extending the incision laterally may cut the deep circumflex iliac artery&rsquo;s ascending branch (p. 300), which runs upwards above the anterior superior iliac spine between the internal oblique and transversus.</p><p>For cosmetic reasons the gridiron incision is often replaced by a more transverse muscle-splitting incision, starting above and medial to the anterior superior iliac spine and extending nearly to the lateral border of the rectus sheath.</p><p>Transverse muscle-cutting incisions can be made above or below the umbilicus, cutting one or both rectus sheaths and muscles and extending laterally into the obliques and transversus, or just cutting the more lateral muscles. Intercostal nerves run obliquely through the lower abdominal wall, but more than one is not likely to be cut by these transverse incisions.</p><p>The oblique muscle-cutting incision (Rutherford Morison&rsquo;s) is similar to the gridiron but after incising the external oblique in the line of its fibers the internal oblique and transversus are cut in the same line (not in the line of their own fibers).</p><p>The lower abdominal transverse incision (Pfannenstiel&rsquo;s) is commonly used for approach to the pelvic organs. A slightly up-curving skin incision is made 3 cm above the pubic symphysis as far as the lateral borders of the rectus sheaths. The anterior layers of the rectus sheaths are divided in the line of the skin incision and flaps dissected off the muscles both upwards and downwards, including midline tissue and with the pyramidalis muscles included in the lower flap. The rectus muscles which at this level lie close together are separated, and linea alba is then incised vertically to expose extraperitoneal tissue, followed by incision of the peritoneum, with care to avoid the bladder. Transverse division of the rectus muscles gives wider exposure, and the incisions can be extended laterally into the flat muscles.</p><p>A lumbar incision is used for extraperitoneal approach to the kidney and upper ureter. The incision extends below the twelfth rib from the lateral border of erector spinae towards the anterior superior iliac spine. Latissimus dorsi and external oblique are incised and their cut edges retracted so that the internal oblique and transversus merging with the lumbar fascia can also be incised. The subcostal nerve deep to internal oblique should be preserved but the vessels can be ligated. The transversalis fascia and extraperitoneal fat in the posterior part of the incision are separated to expose the renal fascia. The peritoneal cavity is not entered. Proper identification of the twelfth rib (especially when short) is essential, to avoid entering the pleural cavity (p. 281).</p><h2 id=abdomen>Abdomen
<a class=anchor href=#abdomen>#</a></h2><p>The abdominal cavity is much more extensive than the impression gained from examination of the anterior abdominal wall. Much of it lies under cover of the lower ribs, for the domes of the diaphragm arch high above the costal margin. Hidden by the lower ribs are the whole of the liver and spleen, much of the stomach, and the upper poles of the kidneys and both suprarenals. The volume of the thoracic cavity is, correspondingly, much less than examination of the bony thorax would suggest. Furthermore, an appreciable amount of the abdominal cavity projects backwards into the pelvis, just in front of the buttocks. A perforating wound of the buttock can easily involve the pelvic cavity. The pelvic cavity accommodates not only its own pelvic organs (rectum, uterus, bladder, etc.), but also a goodly volume of intestine (sigmoid colon and ileum).</p><h2 id=general-topography-of-the-abdomen>General Topography of the Abdomen
<a class=anchor href=#general-topography-of-the-abdomen>#</a></h2><p>The alimentary canal and its two chief derivatives the liver and pancreas (and also the spleen) are developed in fetal mesenteries which later alter their disposition as a result of fusion of adjacent leaves of peritoneum. The liver and spleen remain invested in peritoneum, but the pancreas becomes retroperitoneal.</p><p>The alimentary canal is invested unevenly. Parts of it are free to swing on peritoneal folds (mesenteries); other parts become plastered down to the posterior abdominal wall. The stomach is fixed at its two ends, but elsewhere swings free on mesenteries. The duodenum is plastered down to the posterior abdominal wall, while the whole length of small intestine swings free on its own mesentery. The ascending and descending colon are both adherent to the posterior abdominal wall, but between the colic flexures the transverse colon is mobile on its own mesentery, the transverse mesocolon. The sigmoid (pelvic) colon swings free on a mesentery while, lastly, the rectum is plastered by peritoneum to the hollow of the sacrum.</p><p>The suprarenals, kidneys and ureters lie behind the peritoneum and possess no serous coat. The aorta and inferior vena cava also lie behind the peritoneum. The intestinal vessels run through the mesenteries to reach the gut.</p><p>The division of the abdominal cavity into regions by vertical and horizontal planes (Fig. 5.1) is useful but gives no aid in understanding abdominal topography. By far the most useful plane is the transpyloric plane, and if the structures lying at this level are appreciated the topography of the rest of the abdominal organs becomes clear.</p><p>The transpyloric plane bisects the body between the jugular notch and the pubic symphysis. But the plane need not be defined with geometrical accuracy and it is sufficient to mark it as passing through a point midway between the xiphisternum and the umbilicus, or about a handsbreadth below the xiphisternal joint (Fig. 5.1). It cuts each costal margin at the tip of the ninth costal cartilage, which is at the lateral border of the rectus abdominis (semilunar line); beneath this point on the right side lies the fundus of the gall bladder, on the left is the body of the stomach. The plane passes through the lower border of the first lumbar vertebra, where the spinal cord ends at the conus medullaris.</p><p>As its name implies, the plane passes through the pylorus. It must be noted that the pylorus is free on a mesentery, and therefore mobile. In the erect posture it hangs down over the front of the head of the pancreas, so the plane passes along the head, neck and body of that gland, just above the attachment of the transverse mesocolon. The supracolic compartment (liver, spleen, fundus of stomach) lies above the plane, the infracolic compartment (small intestine, colon) below it. The superior mesenteric artery leaves the aorta at this level, and the splenic vein runs transversely behind the pancreas in the plane. The hilum of each kidney lies at the plane, the right just below and the left just above it, level with the tips of the ninth costal cartilages.</p><p>The peritoneum is a serous membrane which lines the abdominal cavity; it covers the anterior and posterior walls, the under surface of the diaphragm and the pelvic cavity. All this is the parietal peritoneum. In places it leaves the posterior abdominal wall or diaphragm to form a partial or complete investment for viscera; this is the visceral peritoneum, which forms the serous covering for many viscera.</p><p>Peritoneum consists of a single layer of flattened cells, mesothelium, overlying areolar tissue which varies in both thickness and density in different places. Over expansile parts this areolar tissue is loose and cellular (e.g. transversalis fascia on the lower anterior abdominal wall) while over non-expansile parts it is often very thick (e.g. iliac fascia, psoas fascia, parietal pelvic fascia); but loose or dense, thin or thick, these variously named fasciae are part of the one continuous extraperitoneal connective tissue lying between the parietal peritoneum and the walls of the abdominal and pelvic cavities. On the posterior abdominal wall the dense psoas and iliac fasciae and the anterior layer of the.</p><p>Various folds or reflections of peritoneum connect viscera to the abdominal walls or to one another. Some of these are properly called folds, but others may be called a mesentery, omentum or ligament. The double fold supporting most of the small intestine is the mesentery; the mesenteries supporting the transverse colon, sigmoid colon and appendix are the transverse mesocolon, sigmoid mesocolon and mesoappendix. The lesser omentum connects the stomach to the liver, and the greater omentum hangs down from the lower border of the stomach. The various ligaments associated with the liver, stomach and spleen are simply peritoneal folds and bear no relation in structure or strength to the ligaments of muscles and joints; the name as applied to peritoneum is an unfortunate one. A few of these peritoneal structures are easy to see on opening the abdomen through the anterior abdominal wall (e.g. the greater omentum and the mesentery), but others can only be properly appreciated when viscera are displaced or removed.</p><h2 id=peritoneal-folds-of-the-anterior-abdominal-wall>Peritoneal Folds of the Anterior Abdominal Wall
<a class=anchor href=#peritoneal-folds-of-the-anterior-abdominal-wall>#</a></h2><p>On the posterior surface of the anterior abdominal wall the peritoneum is raised into six folds, one above and five below the umbilicus. Passing upwards from the umbilicus behind the linea alba towards the xiphisternum is the falciform ligament. It contains in its posterior and slightly crescentic free margin the ligamentum teres (the obliterated remains of the left umbilical vein, p. 46), which enters the fissure of that name on the visceral surface of the liver. Having delivered the ligamentum to the liver, this double-layered fold continues up and to the right of the midline, between the diaphragm and the anterior and superior surfaces of the liver, where the two layers separate (Fig. 5.35A and as described on p. 342). For the present, note that although the lower part of the ligament is attached to the midline of the abdominal wall, the posterior free margin deviates to the right of the midline while containing the remains of the left umbilical vein.</p><p>Below the umbilicus there is a central fold with a pair on either side. Centrally is the median umbilical fold, containing the median umbilical ligament (the obliterated remains of the urachus). On each side, and also running as far as the umbilicus, is the medial umbilical fold, containing the medial umbilical ligament (the obliterated remains of the umbilical artery). Farther laterally is the lateral umbilical fold, containing the inferior epigastric vessels, which enter the rectus sheath by passing beneath the arcuate line; although called umbilical folds, this lateral pair do not reach as far as the umbilicus.</p><h2 id=peritoneal-cavity-greater-and-lesser-sacs>Peritoneal Cavity: Greater and Lesser Sacs
<a class=anchor href=#peritoneal-cavity-greater-and-lesser-sacs>#</a></h2><p>The serous-coated organs fill the abdominal cavity so that visceral surfaces are in contact with one another or with the parietal peritoneum. The space between them is only potential, not actual, and it contains only a few milliliters of tissue fluid which lubricates adjacent surfaces so they can glide over one another. This is the general peritoneal cavity, body cavity or coelom, and is opened up when incisions that include parietal peritoneum are made through the abdominal wall. Another name for it is the greater sac.</p><p>The lesser sac, properly called the omental bursa, is a diverticulum of the peritoneal cavity behind the stomach. It exists because of the way the liver, stomach and spleen change their positions and shapes during development, and its purpose is to provide a slippery surface for the necessary mobility of the posterior surface of the stomach (Fig. 5.16). It opens into the greater sac through a slit-like aperture in front of the inferior vena cava, the epiploic foramen (Fig. 5.38, and see below).</p><p>Theoretically the cavity of the lesser sac should extend down between the layers of the greater omentum (Fig. 5.16), but because of the fusion of layers it rarely extends much below the stomach. The lesser omentum and stomach form the anterior wall of the sac (Fig. 5.16). To the left the sac extends to the hilum of the spleen (Fig. 5.47), where the peritoneum forms the lienorenal and gastrosplenic ligaments (described below), while at its right edge is the epiploic foramen, also described below with the lesser omentum. The sloping roof of the sac is the peritoneum covering the caudate lobe of the liver (Figs 5.16 and 5.35B), and this is continuous with the peritoneum of the posterior wall which overlies part of the diaphragm, pancreas, left kidney and suprarenal gland (Fig. 5.17). The lowest part of the posterior wall is the transverse mesocolon, attached to the lowest part of the pancreas (Fig. 5.17). Many of these posterior wall features can only be properly understood when this region of the posterior abdominal wall and its associated structures have been considered, but some further details should be noted now.</p><p>Fig. 5.16 Peritoneum of the lesser sac and greater omentum, as seen in diagrammatic sagittal sections looking towards the left. A The theoretical developmental condition, with the two layers of the dorsal mesogastrium overlying the two layers of the transverse mesocolon (containing the transverse colon) and forming a fold (the greater omentum) doubling back to the greater curvature of the stomach. B The end result, with fusion of adjacent double peritoneal layers.</p><p>Cannot explore the whole of the lesser sac, but some features are palpable. Behind the posterior wall to the left of the inferior vena cava is the aorta, here giving off the celiac trunk, two of whose branches may be felt. The common hepatic artery curves down to the right behind the peritoneum and then turns up behind the first inch of the duodenum (Fig. 5.29) to enter the lesser omentum. It raises the pancreaticoduodenal fold, which can be felt; to the left of the fold the fingertip passes steeply downwards behind the pylorus, as if over a step. The left gastric artery runs up towards the esophageal opening to enter the lesser omentum; on its way up it raises the palpable pancreaticogastric fold. These two folds together produce a slight hourglass constriction of the sac beyond which the cavity becomes extensive, but the examining finger cannot reach its limits.</p><p>On opening the abdomen from the front, the most obvious peritoneal structure is the greater omentum.</p><p>Ment from abdominal esophagus to duodenum, along the left and lower border of the stomach (greater curvature).</p><p>The part of the greater omentum immediately below the stomach overlies and fuses with the transverse mesocolon and transverse colon, and can be called the gastrocolic omentum, but it is not a separate structure - merely the name given to this upper part of the greater omentum.</p><p>The two layers of peritoneum that extend between the liver and the upper border (lesser curvature) of the stomach constitute the lesser omentum (sometimes called the gastrohepatic omentum). It can usually only be seen when the liver is lifted up, away from the stomach. Its attachment to the stomach extends from the right side of the abdominal esophagus and along the lesser curvature to the first inch of the duodenum (Fig. 5.17). (Compare with the greater omentum, above: from the left side of the esophagus and along the greater curvature of the stomach.) The liver attachment is L-shaped (Fig. 5.35B), to the fissure for the ligamentum venosum and the porta hepatis. Between the duodenum and the liver it has a right free margin, where the peritoneum of the greater and lesser sacs becomes continuous. Within this fold are the portal vein at the back, with the hepatic artery in front and to the left of the vein and the bile duct to the front and right of the vein (Fig. 5.38). It is here that the portal vein forms the anterior boundary of the epiploic foramen.</p><p>The epiploic foramen (of Winslow, or the aditus to the lesser sac, Fig. 5.38) is a vertical slit about 2.5 cm (1 in) high, like the opening for a coin in a slot machine, and can be slightly stretched to admit the tips of two fingers. Its upper boundary is the caudate process of the liver (p. 345). The lower boundary is the ascending (first) part of the duodenum; this can only be understood if it is appreciated that this part of the duodenum runs not only towards the right but backwards as well (Fig. 5.29). The posterior boundary is the inferior vena cava, here covered by the parietal peritoneum of the posterior abdominal wall which, continuing to the left through the foramen, becomes the peritoneum of the posterior wall of the lesser sac. Anteriorly the foramen is bounded by the right free margin of the lesser omentum containing the portal vein, hepatic artery and bile duct (as described above); since the portal vein is the most posterior of these three structures, the foramen can conveniently be remembered as lying between the two great veins of the abdomen - portal and inferior vena cava.</p><p>Traced downwards over the stomach, the two layers of the lesser omentum become greater omentum (Fig. 5.16). Traced upwards, the two layers enclose the liver and then spread on to the diaphragm and posterior abdominal wall, where they are no longer called lesser omentum but form the coronary, triangular and falciform ligaments (Fig. 5.17) which will be studied with the upper compartments of the peritoneum (below) and with the liver (p. 342).</p><h2 id=peritoneal-compartments>Peritoneal Compartments
<a class=anchor href=#peritoneal-compartments>#</a></h2><p>By virtue of its attachments to the posterior abdominal wall and to various viscera, the peritoneal cavity is descriptively divided into compartments called supracolic, infracolic and pelvic. The supracolic compartment is subdivided into four - right upper and lower, and left upper and lower, while the infracolic compartment has two parts - right (upper) and left (lower). All these are considered below; the pelvic compartment is described on page 394.</p><p>The dividing line between the supracolic and infracolic compartments is the attachment of the transverse mesocolon to the posterior abdominal wall, or rather to the organs that lie on the abdominal wall at this level. From Figures 5.16 and 5.17 note that the attachment is towards the lower border of the (retroperitoneal) pancreas, extending to the right over the duodenum to the lower part of the right kidney at the right colic (hepatic) flexure. On the left the attachment ends over the lower part of the left kidney at the left colic (splenic) flexure. When an opened but otherwise undisturbed abdomen is examined, this root of the transverse mesocolon is not immediately visible. The most obvious feature in the upper abdomen is the stomach, and below it lying over coils of intestine is the greater omentum (see above). A short distance below this curvature, the transverse colon and transverse mesocolon are adherent to the posterior surface of the greater omentum (Fig. 5.16). Lift the greater omentum up over the costal margin; the stomach, transverse colon and mesocolon will be lifted upwards with it, and the posterior surface of the mesocolon will be brought into view (Fig. 5.19). By displacing coils of small intestine downwards, the attachment of the mesocolon can now be seen.</p><p>The attachments of the liver to the diaphragm and abdominal wall which define the subdivisions of the supracolic compartment can be studied by comparing Figures 5.18, 5.29 and 5.35. Place the fingers of one hand above the liver to the right of the falciform ligament and push backwards. Your fingers are prevented from going further by the upper layer of the coronary ligament; your fingers are in the right subphrenic (subdiaphragmatic) compartment. Remove the hand and place the fingers under the right side of the liver and in front of the right kidney. Your fingers are prevented from going further by the lower layer of the coronary ligament; your fingers are in the right subhepatic compartment, better known as the hepatorenal pouch (of Morison). (The upper and lower layers of the coronary ligament meet at the right triangular ligament; these and other details of liver reflections are considered on p. 343.) Remove the hand and now place it above the liver to the left of the falciform ligament and push backwards. Your fingers are prevented from going further by the left triangular ligament, and are in the left subphrenic (subdiaphragmatic) compartment. The fourth subdivision of the supracolic compartment is the left subhepatic compartment - a term not often used, because it is in fact the lesser sac, described above.</p><p>Fig. 5.18 Sagittal section through the right lobe of the liver (L), kidney (K) and transverse colon (C), showing peritoneal reflections and the formation of the hepatorenal pouch.</p><p>When lying supine, the hepatorenal pouch is the lowest part of the peritoneal cavity (with the sole exception of the pelvis), and hence is an area where intraperitoneal fluid is likely to accumulate.</p><p>The infracolic compartment, below the level of the transverse mesocolon, is relatively easy to examine, by lifting up the stomach and greater omentum together with the adherent transverse mesocolon and transverse colon. The whole compartment is divided into two by the attachment of the root of the mesentery (Fig. 5.17), which passes down from left to right at an angle of about 45°. It begins on the left at the duodenojejunal junction, crosses the third part of the duodenum where the superior mesenteric vessels enter between its two layers, and then continues downwards across the aorta, inferior vena cava, right psoas muscle and ureter to the right iliac fossa. This attachment is but 15 cm (6 in) long, although the intestinal border of the mesentery is greatly folded, like the hem of a very full skirt, to accommodate something like 3.5 meters (12 feet) of small intestine. The depth of the mesentery (from root to gut) is about 15 cm (6 in).</p><p>Fig. 5.19 Infracolic compartment of peritoneum. The greater omentum, transverse mesocolon and transverse colon have been lifted up and the small intestine pulled towards the left side of the peritoneal cavity, to show the root of the transverse mesocolon, root of the mesentery and the upper (right) infracolic compartment.</p><p>In the retroperitoneal tissue in the region of the root of the mesentery there are numerous Pacinian corpuscles. It is well established that tension and traction on peritoneal folds in the upper abdomen produce a fall of blood pressure by undue stimulation of these encapsulated mechanoreceptors. In normal circumstances they may serve a protective function by causing reflex contraction of the abdominal wall to aid support of the heavy viscera of the upper abdomen when jarring movements tend to displace the viscera and produce undue traction on their peritoneal attachments.</p><p>If the greater omentum is lifted up and coils of small intestine pressed downwards and to the left, a triangular area of peritoneum of the posterior abdominal wall is exposed, above and to the right of the root of the mesentery (Fig. 5.17). This is the upper (right) infracolic compartment. Its apex lies below, at the ileocecal junction. Its right side is the ascending colon, its left side the attachment of the mesentery of the small intestine, and its base is the attachment of the transverse mesocolon. Examine the floor of the triangle (Fig. 5.17). At the right end the lower pole of the right kidney can be seen and felt, crossed by the ascending branch of the right colic vessels. Just to the left of this the descending (second) part of the duodenum appears, passes downwards for 7.5 cm (3 in) and turns transversely across the posterior abdominal wall for 10 cm (4 in) as the transverse (third) part and ends by passing upwards to the duodenojejunal flexure, at which point the gut breaks free from under the peritoneum of the posterior abdominal wall and, as the jejunum, gains a mesentery. The duodenojejunal flexure, one of the angles of the left infracolic compartment, lies to the left of the midline, over the left psoas muscle, on a level with L2 vertebra. Note that to descend from the right infracolic compartment into the pelvis it is necessary to pass forwards over the lower ileum, and contrast this with the free passage into the pelvis on the left side.</p><p>Lateral to the ascending colon is the right paracolic gutter (Fig. 5.17). It can be traced upwards into the hepatorenal pouch (the right lower supracolic compartment), and downwards into the pelvis - easy pathways for the gravitation of fluid.</p><p>The lower (left) infracolic compartment is exposed by displacing the coils of small intestine upwards and to the right. It is larger than the right infracolic compartment and is quadrilateral in shape. It widens below to pass in a smooth sweep across the pelvic brim into the cavity of the pelvis (Fig. 5.17). Its upper border is the attachment of the transverse mesocolon, between the duodenojejunal flexure (to the left of the midline) and the left colic (splenic) flexure.</p><p>The fourth or ascending part of the duodenum lies in this compartment, in the upper angle to the left of the mesentery of the small intestine and it runs up to the commencement of the jejunum. The paraduodenal fossae (p. 336) lie here. At the lateral end of the upper border, the inferior pole of the left kidney can be seen and felt, in the angle between the transverse mesocolon and the splenic flexure. It is crossed by the ascending branch of the upper left colic vessels. The right border of the left infracolic compartment is provided by the attachment of the mesentery which slopes down to the right iliac fossa. The floor is shallowest in the midline, for the forward prominence of the lumbar vertebrae is here enhanced by the overlying aorta and inferior vena cava. Over the promontory of the sacrum the peritoneal floor dips down in a bold sweep to line the pelvic cavity.</p><p>Lateral to the descending colon is the left paracolic gutter (Fig. 5.17). It is limited above by a small transverse fold of peritoneum between the left (splenic) flexure of the colon and the diaphragm, the phrenicocolic ligament. Unless it has been removed by surgery (e.g. mobilizing the splenic flexure), this helps to prevent the upward spread of infection to the left subphrenic region. Traced downwards the gutter leads to the left of the left edge of the attachment of the sigmoid mesocolon and into the pelvis.</p><p>At the lower end of the left infracolic compartment is the attachment of the sigmoid mesocolon (Fig. 5.17). It is A-shaped and the two limbs diverge from each other at the bifurcation of the common iliac vessels, which point lies on the pelvic brim over the left sacroiliac joint. The lateral limb passes forwards along the pelvic brim (over the external iliac vessels) halfway to the inguinal ligament (i.e. about 5 cm) while the medial limb slopes down into the hollow of the sacrum, where it reaches the midline in front of S3 vertebra, at the commencement of the rectum. At the apex of the junction of these two leaves, just beneath the peritoneum and lying over the bifurcation of the common iliac artery, lies the left ureter: thus the apex is an important landmark for identifying the position of the ureter. Throw the sigmoid colon upwards to expose this point.</p><p>The parietal peritoneum is supplied segmentally by the spinal nerves that innervate the overlying muscles. Thus the diaphragmatic peritoneum is supplied centrally by the phrenic nerve (C4), hence referred pain and hyperesthesia from this area to the tip of the shoulder, and peripherally by intercostal nerves. The remainder of the parietal peritoneum is supplied segmentally by intercostal and lumbar nerves. In the pelvis the obturator nerve is the chief source of supply. The visceral peritoneum has no afferent supply as far as is known; pain from diseased viscera is due to muscle spasm, tension on mesenteric folds or involvement of the parietal peritoneum.</p><p>Some major structures lie on the posterior abdominal wall behind the peritoneum. These include the aorta and inferior vena cava with a number of their branches and tributaries; the cisterna chyli, lymph nodes and vessels; nerves (mostly branches of the lumbar plexus) including the sympathetic trunks; the kidneys, ureters, pancreas, and most of the duodenum and suprarenal glands. All these can be said to lie in the retroperitoneal space, though the term is often used to apply only to the area of the posterior abdominal wall behind the peritoneum that is not occupied by the major viscera and great vessels, e.g. over parts of psoas and other muscles. It is important because hemorrhage and infection may develop in it and be trapped.</p><p>The disposition of the gut and its mesenteries in the early embryo is extremely simple. The more complex arrangement in the adult is due to elongation and consequent coiling of the alimentary canal and to fusion of certain adjacent peritoneal surfaces. Some slight knowledge of the embryology is not only of value in the satisfaction of knowing how the adult arrangement comes about, but has the considerable practical advantage of greatly clarifying understanding of the arterial supply and venous and lymphatic drainage of the whole alimentary system in the adult. The following embryological account, while true in substance, lacks accuracy in places for the purpose of simplification, and is not to be taken as a precise statement of the changes that actually occur in the growing embryo.</p><p>Picture the abdominal cavity just before the sixth week of embryonic life. The alimentary canal is a simple tube passing through to the hind end, its whole length supported by a dorsal mesentery attached in the midline in front of the aorta (Fig. 5.20). Three gut arteries leave the aorta and pass ventrally to supply the tube. The most cranial passes in the dorsal mesogastrium to supply the foregut, the next passes through the dorsal mesentery to supply the midgut and the last passes through the dorsal mesocolon to supply the hindgut. They are the celiac, the superior mesenteric and the inferior mesenteric arteries respectively, and they continue to supply the derivatives of these parts of the alimentary canal in the adult.</p><p>Fig. 5.20 Representation of the developing alimentary canal, viewed from the left, at the stage of herniation of the midgut. Lymphatics run back along the gut arteries to preaortic nodes.</p><p>The foregut possesses, in addition, a ventral mesogastrium attached in the midline to the under surface of the diaphragm and the anterior abdominal wall down to the umbilicus (Fig. 5.20). Its free caudal edge is crescentic and carries the left umbilical vein.</p><p>The derivatives of the foregut (liver and pancreas) and also the spleen are supplied with blood by the artery of the foregut, the celiac artery. The liver develops as an outgrowth from the foregut at its junction with the midgut. A tube grows ventrally into the ventral mesogastrium, bifurcates, and cells proliferate from the blind end of the two divisions to form the two lobes of the liver, which are thus enclosed between the two layers of the ventral mesogastrium. The pancreas develops as two outgrowths, one into the ventral and one into the dorsal mesogastrium. These two parts subsequently fuse and exchange ducts by anastomosis, but the double origin of the pancreas is imprinted on the adult by the persistence of two pancreatic ducts, the main and the accessory. The spleen develops by proliferation of cells in the left leaf of the dorsal mesogastrium. It is not, properly speaking, a derivative of the foregut itself. The celiac artery supplies the stomach and these three organs in the adult, where it is properly called the celiac trunk.</p><h2 id=lymph-drainage-1>Lymph Drainage
<a class=anchor href=#lymph-drainage-1>#</a></h2><p>Lymph from the alimentary canal drains by lymph vessels that run with the arteries and end ultimately in lymph nodes that lie in front of the aorta at the roots of the three gut arteries. Lymph from the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal passes through several filters. In the mucous membrane itself, from tonsils to anal margin, are lymphoid follicles. In the mesentery, at its gut margin, are lymph nodes (the epi- group, e.g. epicolic). In the mesentery between its gut margin and the root of the artery are further nodes (the para- group, e.g. paracolic nodes) while the preaortic nodes, inferior mesenteric, superior mesenteric, and celiac are interconnected by lymph vessels. All the lymph thus ultimately reaches the celiac nodes, whence it passes to the cisterna chyli. This simple lymphatic arrangement persists in the adult.</p><h2 id=herniation-of-the-gut>Herniation of the Gut
<a class=anchor href=#herniation-of-the-gut>#</a></h2><p>By the end of the sixth week the liver has enlarged greatly and the gut has elongated, both to such an extent that the more leisurely growing abdominal walls cannot accommodate them. A loop of gut extrudes into the umbilical cord as the physiological hernia (Fig. 5.20). The loop remains in the umbilical cord for a full month. At the end of the tenth week the abdominal walls have grown enough to accommodate the abdominal contents and the hernia is reduced.</p><p>The herniated loop of gut is that supplied by the superior mesenteric artery and it is defined as the midgut. It is destined to produce all the small intestine from the distal part of the duodenum (i.e. distal to the entry of the bile duct) and the proximal part of the colon, almost as far as the left colic flexure. The apex of the loop is at the attachment of the vitellointestinal duct, the site of the ileal (Meckel&rsquo;s) diverticulum. The main trunk of the superior mesenteric artery is directed to the apex of the loop. Many branches run from it to the proximal limb of the loop, extending from the ventral pancreatic bud to Meckel&rsquo;s diverticulum. They persist as the jejunal and ileal branches. Only three branches run to the distal limb of the loop; all three persist in the adult as the ileocolic, right colic and middle colic arteries. Their directions are altered considerably after the reduction of the physiological hernia and the rotation of the gut.</p><h2 id=rotation-of-the-midgut>Rotation of the Midgut
<a class=anchor href=#rotation-of-the-midgut>#</a></h2><p>As the loop of midgut in the physiological hernia returns to the abdominal cavity it rotates so that the distal limb goes up on the left and the proximal limb goes down on the right, i.e. to the observer looking at the front of the abdomen, in an anticlockwise direction (Fig. 5.21). The distal loop, developing into colon, thus comes to lie anterior to the commencement of the proximal loop. The commencement of the proximal loop becomes, after some rotation, plastered to the posterior abdominal wall as the duodenum, and the mesentery of the transverse colon thus comes to lie across it (Fig. 5.22). The last part of the midgut to be reincluded within the abdominal cavity is the cecum, which lies first near the midline, high up. It grows then to the right, turns downwards at the right colic flexure and stops elongating at the right iliac fossa. It leaves a trail of large intestine to indicate its migration and drags the attached lower end of the ileum with it.</p><p>Rotation of the midgut loop occurs around the axis of the superior mesenteric artery, so in the adult the branches to the proximal loop (jejunal and ileal arteries) come off its left side while the three branches to the distal loop (colic arteries) leave its right side (Figs 5.22 and 5.26).</p><p>Fig. 5.21 Rotation of the midgut loop round the superior mesenteric artery, viewed from the left.</p><p>Fig. 5.22 Return of the physiological hernia and completion of rotation of the midgut, viewed from the front. The midgut loop rotates through 270°.</p><p>The simple dorsal mesentery of the midgut containing the superior mesenteric artery is, of course, much twisted and distorted during the return of the rotated loop of midgut and the subsequent migration of the cecum. Its attachment to the proximal loop causes it to pass across the posterior abdominal wall from the commencement of the loop (duodenum) to the ileocecal junction. The dorsal mesentery of the distal loop of the midgut hinges like a door across from the midline to the right. Its two layers come into contact with the parietal peritoneum in the right paravertebral gutter, so that three layers lie in the floor of the right infracolic compartment. The deeper two fuse and are absorbed, the anterior (originally the right) layer remaining to floor in the right infracolic compartment, with the colic vessels lying immediately deep to it and in front of everything else on the posterior abdominal wall. The dorsal mesentery of the most distal part of the distal loop, pulled across transversely, does not fuse completely with the parietal peritoneum and persists, with the middle colic artery between its layers, as the transverse mesocolon (Fig. 5.22).</p><h2 id=movement-of-the-hindgut>Movement of the Hindgut
<a class=anchor href=#movement-of-the-hindgut>#</a></h2><p>As the midgut loop returns to the abdominal cavity, the hindgut swings on its dorsal mesocolon like a door across to the left (Fig. 5.23). The two layers of the mesocolon thus come to lie on the parietal peritoneum of the left paravertebral gutter. The left infracolic compartment is floored in by three layers of peritoneum. The two deeper layers fuse and are absorbed; the anterior (originally the right) layer persists, with the left colic vessels immediately beneath it and lying in front of everything else on the posterior abdominal wall. At the pelvic brim fusion of the layers is not complete and a small part of the intestinal edge of the dorsal mesocolon of the hindgut remains free as the sigmoid mesocolon of the adult.</p><p>Fig. 5.23 Hindgut before and after return of the midgut hernia, viewed from the front. The mesocolon fuses with the peritoneum of the posterior abdominal wall except at the pelvic brim, where part of the embryonic mesocolon persists as the sigmoid mesocolon.</p><p>Diaphragm and peels apart the left and right leaves of the ventral mesogastrium. Refer to the fully developed position in Figure 5.35B, and note that the left leaf of this part of the mesogastrium (the falciform ligament) sweeps to the left and back again on itself to make a double fold, the left triangular ligament. The right leaf sweeps to the right and back again but these two folds are not close together; between them the liver comes into contact with the diaphragm as the bare area, and the folds surrounding it are the upper layer of the coronary ligament and the right triangular ligament (reflected on to the diaphragm) and the lower layer of the coronary ligament (reflected on to the right kidney, forming the hepatorenal pouch, p. 316 and Fig. 5.17).</p><p>The peritoneal flanges of the coronary ligament and left triangular ligament are short, and their attachments to liver and diaphragm are identical. The falciform ligament is wider, and its visceral and parietal attachments do not coincide. The liver attachment lies to the right of the midline, the parietal attachments lie in the midline; the ligament lies with its right surface against the anterior abdominal wall and its left surface against the liver.</p><h2 id=rotation-of-the-foregut>Rotation of the Foregut
<a class=anchor href=#rotation-of-the-foregut>#</a></h2><p>Coincident with the growth of the liver, the foregut rotates. The liver originally was ventral to the foregut, in the ventral mesogastrium, and both lay in the midline. As the liver grows it swings to the right, taking the ventral mesogastrium with it. The stomach swings across to the left and in doing so rotates (Fig. 5.24). It has already elongated and broadened, with its dorsal border becoming convex, and its ventral border concave. The distal end of the foregut, destined to become the duodenum (i.e. proximal to the entry of the bile duct), does not dilate in this manner, and its dorsal mesentery shortens. The duodenal part of the gut elongates into a loop which swings to the right and becomes plastered to the posterior abdominal wall (like the ascending and descending parts of the colon). At the same time its walls grow asymmetrically so that the ventral bile duct and pancreatic duct are carried around to open on the medial wall (see Fig. 5.39) in line with the duct of the dorsal diverticulum. The duodenum is now fixed in position; so, too, is the esophagus at the diaphragm. Between these two fixed points as an axis, the dorsal convexity of the stomach rotates to the left. The dorsal convexity becomes the greater curvature, and the original left side now faces anteriorly. The concave ventral border now becomes the lesser curvature, fixed by the lesser omentum (originally the ventral mesogastrium) to the under surface of the liver, and to the diaphragm between liver and esophagus. The original right surface of the stomach now lies behind, against the peritoneum of the posterior abdominal wall, and the free edge of the lesser omentum lies over the opening from the greater sac into this space behind the stomach, the lesser sac.</p><p>Fig. 5.24 Rotation of the stomach, viewed from the front after removal of the liver (kidney and pancreas not shown). The dorsal mesogastrium balloons down and to the left (and the spleen develops within it), and the stomach rotates through 90° so that its left surface becomes anterior, and its right surface becomes posterior, at the front of the lesser sac, with the spleen at the left margin of the sac.</p><p>Meanwhile changes have occurred in the disposition of the dorsal mesogastrium. It will be remembered that it was attached to the midline of the posterior abdominal wall. As the dorsal border of the stomach swings to the left the dorsal mesogastrium hinges to the left from this attachment and adheres to the parietal peritoneum as far left as the front of the left kidney. Its left layer fuses with the peritoneum on the posterior abdominal wall and the two become absorbed (Fig. 5.24). The original right layer of the dorsal mesogastrium then lies on the posterior abdominal wall, with the left gastric and splenic branches of the celiac artery (originally running in the dorsal mesogastrium) immediately deep to it. From the front of the left kidney, and from the diaphragm above it, the two layers of the dorsal mesogastrium pass to the esophagus and the upper part of the greater curvature of the stomach. They form part of the greater omentum, and constitute the left boundary of the lesser sac behind the stomach. The spleen projects from the left leaf into the greater sac, and it divides this part of the greater omentum into gastrosplenic and lienorenal ligaments as already seen.</p><p>Lower part of the greater curvature of the stomach, the inferior border of the pylorus and the first inch of the duodenum. Its dorsal attachment, in the midline, hinges to the left and becomes plastered to, and fused with, the peritoneum on the posterior abdominal wall over the pancreas. Below this it balloons down like an apron from the greater curvature, over the transverse mesocolon and transverse colon, and its posterior part returns to the posterior abdominal wall (Fig. 5.16A). Each part consists of the double layer of the original dorsal mesogastrium. The deeper part of the double layer fuses with the upper leaf of the transverse mesocolon and with the transverse colon itself, forming the inferior limit of the lesser sac. The superficial part of the double layer hangs down from the greater curvature directly to the transverse colon, to which it adheres, forming the anterior wall of the lower part of the lesser sac (Fig. 5.16).</p><p>From the transverse colon the two folds of the double layer hang down over the front of the coils of small intestine; adjacent leaves of peritoneum become practically fused to each other and can be separated only partially and with difficulty in the adult. They form the fat-containing apron, the greater omentum.</p><p>When the disposition of the peritoneum in the adult is clear, the course of the three ventral branches of the aorta to the gut (celiac, superior and inferior mesenteric) can be followed simply.</p><p>The splenic artery passes to the left. It is said to be very tortuous but is often straighter than most textbooks suggest; the crests of its waves may appear above the pancreas, and the troughs lie hidden behind its upper border. It runs across the left crus and left psoas to the hilum of the left kidney, where it turns forward in the lienorenal ligament to the hilum of the spleen (p. 356). Apart from the spleen it is the main supply to the pancreas (p. 353). Before breaking up into its terminal splenic branches it gives off the short gastric arteries which run in the gastrosplenic ligament, and the left gastroepiploic artery which runs in the greater omentum (p. 332).</p><p>The common hepatic artery passes over the upper border of the pancreas, downwards and to the right behind the peritoneum of the posterior abdominal wall (in the lesser sac) as far as the first part of the duodenum. It turns forward at the opening into the lesser sac (epiploic foramen) and curves upwards into the space between the two layers of the lesser omentum becoming the hepatic artery. Note this change in terminology: the vessel arising from the celiac trunk is the common hepatic, and it changes its name to plain hepatic on turning upwards. Here it meets the bile duct and lies on its left side, both in front of the portal vein. All three lie in this position, between the duodenum and the porta hepatis, surrounded by the peritoneum at the free edge of the lesser omentum. On reaching the porta hepatis, the hepatic artery divides into right and left branches to supply the right and left halves of the liver (Fig. 5.38A). These branches and the associated aberrant or accessory hepatic arteries are described on page 346.</p><p>The right gastric artery leaves the common hepatic as it turns into the lesser omentum to reach the stomach (p. 332).</p><p>The gastroduodenal artery passes down behind the first part of the duodenum, to the left of the portal vein, and divides into two. The right gastroepiploic artery passes forward between the first part of the duodenum and the pancreas, and turns to the left to enter between the two leaves of the greater omentum at their attachment over the front of the head of the pancreas.</p><p>The other branch of the gastroduodenal artery is the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery. It divides into two branches, which encircle the head of the pancreas in the concavity of the duodenum down to the entrance of the bile duct. They consist of a small anterior and a larger posterior branch, each of which anastomoses with similar branches of the inferior pancreaticoduodenal branch of the superior mesenteric artery. The entrance of the bile duct marks the junction of foregut and midgut, and is the meeting place of the arterial distributions of the respective arteries, celiac and superior mesenteric. The pancreaticoduodenal arteries supply the duodenum and the adjacent head of the pancreas (pp. 336 and 353).</p><p>It is convenient to study the venous return with the arterial supply, for the two are essentially similar. Right and left gastric, right and left gastroepiploic veins run with the corresponding arteries. All this blood reaches the liver via the portal vein (p. 351) and, with the arterial blood of the hepatic artery, passes through the liver to be carried via the hepatic veins to the inferior vena cava.</p><p>The superior mesenteric vein passes up behind the pancreas and continues as the portal vein, a new name it receives after the splenic vein has joined it at a right angle behind the neck of the pancreas. The veins of the stomach empty into the nearest part of the vertical venous channel formed by the superior mesenteric and portal veins. They correspond with the arteries of the stomach with the single exception that there is no gastroduodenal vein. But there is a small prepyloric vein (p. 333).</p><p>The lower third of the esophagus in the posterior mediastinum drains downwards by esophageal veins, through the esophageal opening in the diaphragm, to the left gastric vein. The esophagus above this level drains into the azygos system of veins. Here is a watershed from which venous blood is diverted into the systemic system and the portal system (p. 351). In portal obstruction from any cause the esophageal tributaries of the left gastric vein become distended beneath the mucous membrane of the lower esophagus. Such esophageal varices may rupture and give rise to massive hemorrhage.</p><p>The left gastric vein runs to the left along the lesser curvature up to the esophagus, then passes around behind the peritoneum of the posterior wall of the lesser sac, with the left gastric artery. It passes down to the right above the hepatic artery and joins the portal vein at the upper border of the pancreas. The right gastric vein runs along the lesser curvature to the pylorus and, to the right, behind the first part of the duodenum, it empties into the portal vein. It may receive the prepyloric vein if this has not drained into the portal vein.</p><p>The short gastric and left gastroepiploic vein run with the arteries through the gastrosplenic ligament and greater omentum to the hilum of the spleen, where they empty into the splenic vein.</p><p>The splenic vein begins in the hilum of the spleen by confluence of half a dozen tributaries from that organ. Having received the short gastric and left gastroepiploic veins, it passes with the tail of the pancreas, below the splenic artery, through the lienorenal ligament to lie over the hilum of the left kidney. It is a large straight vein which passes to the right in contact with the posterior surface of the pancreas (Fig. 5.29). In its course it lies on the hilum of the left kidney, the left psoas muscle and left sympathetic trunk, the left crus of the diaphragm, the aorta and superior mesenteric artery and the inferior vena cava. It lies in front of the left renal vein along the upper border of that vessel. In front of the inferior vena cava it joins the vertical trunk of superior mesenteric and portal veins at a right angle. It receives many tributaries from the tail, body, neck and head of the pancreas. As it lies in front of the left crus of the diaphragm it receives the inferior mesenteric vein from the hindgut.</p><p>The right gastroepiploic vein runs to the right in the greater omentum until that peritoneal structure becomes fused to the peritoneum of the posterior abdominal wall over the head of the pancreas. It runs down over the front of the pancreas, behind the peritoneum, to join the superior mesenteric vein at the lower border of the neck of the pancreas.</p><p>The artery of the midgut is the superior mesenteric, which supplies the gut from the entrance of the bile duct to a level just short of the splenic flexure of the colon. In the embryo it is directed to the apex of the loop of midgut in the physiological hernia (Fig. 5.21), the site of attachment of the vitellointestinal duct. This is the site of the ileal (Meckel&rsquo;s) diverticulum - in the adult it is in the ileum about 60 cm (2 feet) proximal to the cecum and the artery terminates at this point. The rotation of the midgut loop occurs around this artery at its axis. The cranially directed branches (jejunal and ileal) to the proximal loop of the midgut thus face to the left in the adult, and the three caudally directed branches (ileocolic, right colic and middle colic) face to the right (Fig. 5.26).</p><p>The superior mesenteric artery arises from the front of the aorta a centimeter below the celiac trunk, at the level of L1 vertebra. It is directed steeply downwards behind the splenic vein and the neck of the pancreas. With the superior mesenteric vein on its right side it lies on the left renal vein, then on the uncinate process of the pancreas, then on the third part of the duodenum (Fig. 5.29). Here the two vessels enter the upper end of the mesentery of the small intestine. They pass down to the right along the root of the mesentery and end at the ileum 60 cm (2 feet) proximal to the cecum (Fig. 5.26). Pressure of the superior mesenteric artery on the left renal vein may produce left-sided varicocele in either sex, and pressure on the duodenum may give symptoms of chronic duodenal ileus.</p><p>Fig. 5.26 Distribution of the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries to the large intestine. The transverse colon has been displaced upwards to expose the inferior layer of the transverse mesocolon; the middle colic artery thus appears to be running upwards, but in the normal position it passes downwards.</p><p>The inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery is its first branch, arising from the posterior surface, though it often comes off the first jejunal branch. It supplies the commencement of the midgut; that is to say, the duodenum below the entrance of the bile duct. It runs in the curve between the duodenum and the head of the pancreas, supplies both, and anastomoses with the terminal branches of the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery. The right hepatic artery occasionally arises with the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery and runs up behind the portal vein and bile duct to supply the right half of the liver (p. 346).</p><p>The ileocolic artery (Fig. 5.26) arises from the right side of the superior mesenteric trunk low down in the base of the mesentery. It runs therein to the ileocecal junction, where it gives off an ileal branch which anastomoses with the terminal branch of the superior mesenteric artery and a colic branch which runs up along the left side of the ascending colon, behind the peritoneal floor of the right infracolic compartment, to anastomose with the right colic artery. The artery now divides into anterior and posterior cecal arteries (p. 338).</p><p>The right colic artery (Fig. 5.26) arises in the root of the mesentery from the right side of the superior mesenteric artery, often in common with the ileocolic artery. It runs to the right across the right psoas muscle, gonadal vessels, ureter and genitofemoral nerve, and quadratus lumborum, just behind the peritoneal floor of the right infracolic compartment. It divides near the left side of the ascending colon into two branches. The descending branch runs down to anastomose with the colic branch of the ileocolic artery. The ascending branch runs up across the inferior pole of the right kidney to the hepatic flexure where it anastomoses with a branch of the middle colic artery. From these two branches multiple vessels sink into the walls of the colon.</p><p>The middle colic artery (Fig. 5.26) is the highest branch from the right side of the superior mesenteric artery. It arises as the artery emerges at the lower border of the neck of the pancreas and passes forwards between the two leaves of the transverse mesocolon. It lies to the right of the midline and at the intestinal border of the transverse mesocolon it divides into right and left branches which run along the margin of the transverse colon. The right branch anastomoses with the ascending branch of the right colic artery. The left branch supplies the transverse colon almost to the splenic flexure (the distal part of the midgut) where it anastomoses with a branch of the left colic artery. From these two branches multiple vessels sink into the walls of the colon. As the middle colic lies to the right of the midline it leaves a large avascular window to its left in the transverse mesocolon. This window is the site of election for surgical access to the lesser sac and the posterior wall of the stomach (Fig. 5.26). Note that in most illustrations of the middle colic artery (as in Fig. 5.26), the artery appears to be running upwards because the transverse colon and mesocolon have been lifted up. In life of course the vessel passes downwards.</p><h2 id=venous-drainage-of-the-midgut>Venous Drainage of the Midgut
<a class=anchor href=#venous-drainage-of-the-midgut>#</a></h2><p>This is quite regular. Each branch of the superior mesenteric artery is accompanied by a vein. All these veins flow into the superior mesenteric vein, a large trunk which lies to the right of the artery. It crosses the third part of the duodenum, runs between the uncinate process and the neck of the pancreas to be joined by the splenic vein to form the portal vein. This continues upwards behind the first part of the duodenum. The superior mesenteric and portal veins represent a single continuing venous trunk, named portal vein above, and superior mesenteric vein below, the level of entry of the splenic vein (Fig. 5.29).</p><h2 id=blood-supply-of-the-hindgut>Blood Supply of the Hindgut
<a class=anchor href=#blood-supply-of-the-hindgut>#</a></h2><p>The artery of the hindgut is the inferior mesenteric. The muscle walls of the rectal ampulla and anal canal receive a reinforcement of arterial supply from the middle and inferior rectal arteries but the mucous membrane is supplied by the inferior mesenteric artery as far as the upper third of the anal canal.</p><p>The inferior mesenteric artery arises from the front of the aorta at the inferior border of the third part of the duodenum, opposite L3 vertebra, at the level of the umbilicus. It is much smaller than the superior mesenteric artery. It runs obliquely down to the pelvic brim immediately beneath the peritoneal floor of the left infracolic compartment. It crosses the pelvic brim at the bifurcation of the left common iliac vessels over the sacroiliac joint, at which point it converges on the ureter, at the apex of the A-shaped attachment of the sigmoid mesocolon. In its course it lies on the aorta, left psoas muscle and sympathetic trunk and the left common iliac artery, and hypogastric nerve. Over the pelvic brim it continues along the pelvic wall in the root of the sigmoid mesocolon as the superior rectal artery (p. 380). It does not cross the ureter where the two meet at the pelvic brim, but all its branches cross to the left in front of the ureter and the other structures in the floor of the left infracolic compartment.</p><p>The left colic artery leaves the trunk and passes up to the left towards the splenic flexure, lying beneath the peritoneal floor of the left infracolic compartment. After a very short course it divides into an ascending and a descending branch. The ascending branch passes laterally and upwards, crossing the left psoas muscle, gonadal vessels, ureter and genitofemoral nerve, and quadratus lumborum. It is crossed by the inferior mesenteric vein. It divides into two branches. The upper branch passes upwards across the inferior pole of the left kidney to the splenic flexure. The lower branch passes transversely to the descending colon. Each of the arteries divides into ascending and descending branches which anastomose with the left branch of the middle colic artery and with each other to continue the arterial circle around the concavity of the large intestine (p. 341).</p><p>The descending branch passes laterally but downwards crossing the same structures as the ascending branch but lower down, and divides above the pelvic brim into two or three branches. They pass to the left behind the peritoneum of the iliac fossa and supply the lower part of the descending colon and the sigmoid colon, forming anastomosing loops with each other before doing so.</p><p>The sigmoid arteries are three or four branches which pass forwards between the layers of the sigmoid mesocolon, in which they form anastomosing loops from which vessels sink into the wall of the sigmoid colon.</p><h2 id=venous-drainage-of-the-hindgut>Venous Drainage of the Hindgut
<a class=anchor href=#venous-drainage-of-the-hindgut>#</a></h2><p>The venous drainage of the rectum and anal canal is considered in detail on page 403. The superior rectal vein runs up in the root of the sigmoid mesocolon, on the left of the superior rectal artery, to the pelvic brim, above which it is named the inferior mesenteric vein. This receives tributaries identical with the branches of the inferior mesenteric artery. The vein itself runs vertically upwards well to the left of the artery, beneath the peritoneal floor of the left infracolic compartment. It lies on the left psoas muscle, in front of the gonadal vessels, ureter and genitofemoral nerve. At the upper limit of the left infracolic compartment, just below the attachment of the transverse mesocolon, it lies to the left of the duodenojejunal flexure. Here it curves towards the right and often raises up a ridge of peritoneum. This ridge may be excavated by a small recess of peritoneum which makes a shallow cave beneath, the paraduodenal recess (p. 336).</p><p>The inferior mesenteric vein now passes behind the lower border of the body of the pancreas, in front of the left renal vein, and joins the splenic vein. Occasionally it curves to the right still more sharply, and, passing behind the pancreas, below and parallel with the splenic vein, in front of the superior mesenteric artery, opens directly into the superior mesenteric vein.</p><h2 id=lymph-drainage-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract>Lymph Drainage of the Gastrointestinal Tract
<a class=anchor href=#lymph-drainage-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract>#</a></h2><p>From the whole length of the gastrointestinal tract the lymph vessels pass back along the arteries to lymph nodes that lie in front of the aorta at the origins of the gut arteries (Fig. 5.20). These comprise the celiac, superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric groups of lymph nodes. They drain into each other from below upwards, the celiac group itself draining by two or three lymph channels into the cisterna chyli.</p><p>These preaortic lymph nodes are the last in a series of lymph node filters that lie between the mucous membrane of the gut and the cisterna chyli. The first filtering mechanism consists of isolated lymphoid follicles which lie in the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal from mouth to anus. They are not very numerous in the esophagus, are more numerous in the stomach, and become increasingly so along the small intestine (the GALT, p. 16). In the lower reaches of the ileum they become aggregated together into Peyer&rsquo;s patches visible through the muscular wall. These lie on the antimesenteric border of the ileum and are oval in shape, with their long axes lying longitudinally along the ileum. In the large intestine the lymphoid follicles in the mucous membrane are numerous, but isolated from each other. In the appendix they are aggregated as in a tonsil.</p><p>Fig. 5.27 Lymph drainage of the stomach. A The lesser sac has been opened up by cutting the gastrocolic omentum above the transverse colon, to show lymph nodes associated with branches of the celiac trunk. B Direction of lymph flow from the stomach, as described in the text.</p><p>Lymph vessels pass from the follicles in the mucous membrane through the muscle wall of the gut to nearby nodes. The various groups of nodes are considered with the individual organs and have particular significance for the stomach and large intestine in view of the prevalence of carcinoma in these sites. However, it is convenient to note here that the small and large intestines have a common pattern of three groups of nodes. The first group lies in the peritoneum adjacent to the margin of the gut, and are known as juxtaintestinal nodes in the mesentery of the small intestine, and paracolic nodes for the large intestine. The second group lies along the main blood vessels of supply, and the third are the preaortic groups at the bases of the celiac and the superior and inferior mesenteric vessels. The large intestine has some additional nodes which lie on the external surface of the gut wall (and occasionally within appendices epiploicae); these are the epicolic nodes.</p><h2 id=nerve-supply-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract>Nerve Supply of the Gastrointestinal Tract
<a class=anchor href=#nerve-supply-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract>#</a></h2><p>All parts of the gut and its derivatives are innervated by parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves, which travel together along the gut arteries to reach their destination. Most come from the celiac plexus, but the inferior hypogastric (pelvic) plexus contributes parasympathetic fibers to the hindgut.</p><p>From the middle third of the esophagus to the rectum, nerve cells and fibers that supply muscle, blood vessels and glands are concentrated in two plexuses. The myenteric plexus (of Auerbach) is situated between the two muscle layers of the gut and the submucous plexus (of Meissner) is in the submucosa. In the myenteric plexus the ganglion cells are usually in small groups, while in the submucous plexus they are scattered singly. Collectively the plexuses form the enteric nervous system, estimated to consist of 50-100 million neurons (as many as in the spinal cord). The system receives postganglionic sympathetic (inhibitory) and preganglionic parasympathetic (excitatory) fibers, but is unique in being able to function without these extrinsic efferent supplies, which do not pass directly to the gut muscle; the enteric system always intervenes. Some ganglion cells belong to afferent fibers that connect with other plexus cells or with the spinal cord (by the sympathetic trunks) and brainstem (by the vagus). The vagi below the diaphragm consist of 90% afferent fibers.</p><p>Apart from adrenergic and cholinergic neurons, others produce a variety of putative transmitters such as substance P, VIP and other neuropeptides and serotonin, whose precise functions in the normal human gut are still being unraveled.</p><h2 id=general-structural-features>General Structural Features
<a class=anchor href=#general-structural-features>#</a></h2><p>The alimentary canal has its embryological origin in the yolk sac. It is lined by epithelium derived from the endoderm, and outgrowths from this epithelium (liver and pancreas) are thus endodermal in origin.</p><p>Macroscopically the alimentary canal is a tube of muscle lined with mucous membrane and covered, for the most part, with peritoneum.</p><p>The muscular wall of the alimentary canal, from the upper end of the esophagus to the lower end of the rectum is in two separate layers, an inner circular and an outer longitudinal. This arrangement is characteristic of all tubes that empty by orderly peristalsis and not by a mass contraction. In reality the muscle is in two spiral layers. The inner layer forms a closewound spiral and is known as the circular layer, while the outer layer spirals in such gradual fashion that its fibers are virtually longitudinal, the longitudinal layer. The latter is mostly separated into three discrete bundles in the colon. An innermost third layer reinforces the body of the stomach.</p><p>The mucous membrane of the alimentary tube consists of three components: epithelium, an underlying connective tissue layer or lamina propria, and a thin layer of visceral muscle, the muscularis mucosae. The main features of each region are summarized below. Note that as far as identifying histological slides is concerned it is the form of the mucous membrane, and particularly the types of epithelial cells, which are the key features.</p><h2 id=esophagus>Esophagus
<a class=anchor href=#esophagus>#</a></h2><p>The epithelium is stratified squamous non-keratinizing, like that of most of the mouth. The muscularis mucosae, which is absent from the uppermost part, is characteristically thicker in the esophagus than in any other part of the alimentary tract. Small groups of mucus-secreting glands may be present at the upper and lower ends, in both the mucosa and submucosa.</p><p>At the cardio-esophageal junction, there is an abrupt change from stratified to single-layered columnar epithelium which continues all the way to the anal canal but with differing cell types and configuration in the different organs. Throughout, the epithelium is not a flat layer but dips down into the connective tissue lamina propria to form myriads of glands. In the main part of the stomach, the body, the mucus-secreting surface cells dip down to form the gastric pits which in turn continue downwards as the straight test-tube-like glands whose cells include the peptic and parietal cells secreting pepsin and hydrochloric acid respectively. The parietal cells also secrete intrinsic factor, necessary for the intestinal absorption of vitamin B12. For about a 1-centimeter ring at the cardia the glands are shorter and the cells all mucus-secreting, while in the pyloric region distal to the body the glands are like coiled test-tubes and again the cells are all mucus-secreting, although this part of the stomach contains most of the gastrin-producing endocrine G cells, as well as D cells which secrete somatostatin. Enterochromaffin (EC) cells in both body and pyloric regions produce serotonin and endorphin.</p><h2 id=small-intestine>Small Intestine
<a class=anchor href=#small-intestine>#</a></h2><p>In the whole length of the small intestine, the columnar epithelium not only dips down to form glands (otherwise known as the crypts of Lieberkühn) but is also thrown up between the gland openings into villi, which consist of finger-like or leaf-like connective tissue cores covered by epithelium. Some of the villous cells are mucus-secreting goblet cells; others are the absorbing cells or enterocytes. Both types are derived from progenitors in the crypts and are constantly being shed and renewed, every few days. (So are other alimentary epithelial cells but at slower rates.) At the bases of the crypts are the granular Paneth cells which secrete lysozyme. Scattered among the other crypt cells are various enteroendocrine cells responsible for the production of intestinal hormones, including secretin, somatostatin and CCK, as well as EC cells.</p><p>The duodenum is distinguished from the rest of the small intestine in having mucus-secreting glands (of Brunner) in the submucosa. In the terminal ileum there are groups of lymphoid follicles in the mucosa forming Peyer&rsquo;s patches and appearing in histological sections as a row of follicles, in contrast to single follicles which can be found throughout the alimentary canal from mouth to anus.</p><h2 id=large-intestine>Large Intestine
<a class=anchor href=#large-intestine>#</a></h2><p>In the large intestine there are no villi, only glands (crypts) containing a high proportion of goblet cells. In the appendix, which is almost invariably studied histologically as a cross-sectioned tube lined by the large intestinal type of mucosa, the glands are rather shallower and less closely packed than in the rest of the large intestine, and there are numerous lymphoid follicles in the mucosa and submucosa.</p><p>In the upper part of the anal canal, the columnar epithelium gives place to the stratified squamous type, but here the junction is not as clear cut as the change at the cardia, and small islands of one type of epithelium may be found in an area otherwise composed of the other type.</p><h2 id=part-5-gastrointestinal-tract>Part 5 Gastrointestinal Tract
<a class=anchor href=#part-5-gastrointestinal-tract>#</a></h2><p>The alimentary canal extends from mouth to anus. Its uppermost parts - the mouth, pharynx and esophagus - are in the head, neck and thorax; the rest is in the abdominal cavity and consists of the stomach, small intestine and large intestine, collectively known as the gastrointestinal tract (although the clinical gastroenterologist usually includes the esophagus as well). The last 1 cm or so of the esophagus extends through the diaphragm to join the stomach, and the last 4 cm of the tract is the anal canal which leaves the lowest or pelvic part of the abdominal cavity to lie in the perineum and open at the anus.</p><p>The abdominal esophagus projects through the diaphragm at the level of the seventh costal cartilage a thumb&rsquo;s breadth to the left of the sternum and level with T10 vertebra. This abdominal portion is bound firmly to the margins of the diaphragmatic opening by fibrous tissue, the phreno-esophageal ligament, and it turns forwards and to the left immediately below the opening. The anterior and posterior vagal trunks are related to the respective surfaces here (p. 334). It is invested by peritoneum which passes from it on the right to the diaphragm (the upper part of the lesser omentum) and on the left to the diaphragm (the upper part of the greater omentum). The posterior wall of the esophagus is rather shorter than the anterior, for the orifice in the diaphragm lies very nearly vertical. This posterior part of the esophagus can scarcely be said to possess a serous coat, for the fold of peritoneum that lies against it is not firmly attached, and is stripped up slightly when the abdominal esophagus elongates (a miniature replica of the roof of the retropubic space - p. 381).</p><p>The esophagus enters the stomach at the cardiac orifice. The fibers of the right crus that pass to the left of the diaphragmatic opening maintain the constant angle between the esophagus and stomach. Various factors have been considered to guard against the reflux of gastric contents; these include the sphincteric actions of the lower esophageal muscle fibers or the fibers of the right crus, a mucosal flap produced by the muscularis mucosae of the stomach, and the differences between the negative intrathoracic and positive intra-abdominal pressures.</p><h2 id=stomach>Stomach
<a class=anchor href=#stomach>#</a></h2><p>The stomach is the most dilated part of the alimentary tract, interposed between the esophagus and duodenum in the upper part of the abdominal cavity and lying mainly in the left hypochondrial, epigastric and umbilical regions with much of it under cover of the lower ribs. It is a muscular bag, relatively fixed at both ends but otherwise subject to great variations in size depending on the volume of its contents. In the newborn it is the size of a hen&rsquo;s egg, with a capacity of 30 ml, but in the adult it may comfortably accommodate 1500 ml or more. The junction with the esophagus is the cardia (cardiac orifice, gastro-esophageal junction), the most fixed part of the whole organ. It lies under the diaphragm, usually to the left of the midline at the level of T10 vertebra. The distal opening is the pyloric opening, at the gastroduodenal junction. In the recumbent position with the stomach empty, this orifice is typically to the right of the midline at the level of L1 vertebra but may be considerably lower.</p><p>The main parts of the stomach are the fundus, body and pyloric part, with the greater and lesser curvatures forming the upper (right) and lower (left) borders (as seen from the front) and joining the anterior and posterior surfaces. The stomach is completely invested by peritoneum, which passes in a double layer from the lesser curvature to the liver as the lesser omentum, and hanging down from the fundus and greater curvature as the greater omentum, which fuses with the transverse colon and mesocolon (p. 314).</p><p>The fundus is the part which projects upwards above the level of the cardiac, and is in contact with the left dome of the diaphragm. It is usually full of gas (swallowed air rather than fermentation products).</p><p>The largest part of the stomach is the body, extending from the fundus to the angular notch (incisura angularis) of the lower part of the lesser curvature. This notch is a permanent feature and is not due to a transient peristaltic wave. Variable amounts of the body will be above and below the costal margin, in contact with the diaphragm and anterior abdominal wall, depending on the build and habitus of the individual and the changing volume of gastric contents. Likewise the lowest part of the greater curvature may be above or below umbilical level.</p><p>The pyloric part extends from the angular notch to the gastroduodenal junction, and consists of the proximal pyloric antrum which narrows distally as the pyloric canal. The circular muscle of the distal end of the canal is palpably thickened to form the pyloric sphincter, whose position is indicated on the anterior surface by the prepyloric vein, and its narrow lumen is the pylorus (though the word is commonly used to mean the sphincter). The pyloric canal has some mobility because it is enclosed between the peritoneum of the right extremities of the greater and lesser omenta (like the rest of the pyloric part). It hangs down over the head and neck of the pancreas. The pylorus is normally open; when a wave of gastric contraction reaches the sphincter, it contracts to squirt some gastric contents into the duodenum, but at the same time some are squeezed back into the stomach to help mix the contents.</p><p>Fig. 5.28 Radiograph of the stomach and duodenum after a barium meal.</p><p>Behind the stomach are a group of structures comprising the stomach bed. The posterior wall of the stomach is covered by peritoneum of the anterior wall of the lesser sac (p. 313), and the bed is covered by the lesser sac&rsquo;s posterior wall. Apart from the left crus and dome of the diaphragm the bed consists of the upper part of the left kidney overlaid by a triangle of structures - the pancreas transversely, with the spleen at the upper lateral side and the suprarenal gland at the upper medial side. The transverse mesocolon slopes down from the lower border of the pancreas, while along its upper border are seen the crests of the waves of the tortuous splenic artery. To the right of the lesser curvature in the midline lies the aorta with the celiac trunk dividing into its three branches with the celiac ganglia on either side and celiac lymph nodes.</p><p>The stomach is supplied by branches from the celiac trunk (p. 324). Along the lesser curvature between the two layers of the lesser omentum the left gastric artery anastomoses with the right gastric (usually a branch of the hepatic or gastroduodenal arteries). The fundus and upper left part of the greater curvature receive the short gastric arteries, five or six vessels which run from the splenic artery in the gastrosplenic ligament. The rest of the curvature is supplied by the left and right gastroepiploic vessels (from the splenic and gastroduodenal).</p><p>The left and right gastric arteries may be double and run as two parallel branches along the lesser curvature; whether single or double they anastomose end-on with one another. So usually do the gastroepiploic vessels (they are rarely double) but sometimes their ends simply sink into the gastric wall. All these vessels give off their gastric branches at right angles (in contrast to branches from the vagal nerve trunks which come off obliquely - see below); they enter the anterior and posterior walls of the stomach. The epiploic branches of the gastroepiploics pass downwards between the leaves of the greater omentum; they are the largest of all the vessels that supply the peritoneum, ensuring that the mobile omentum receives a large supply of blood-borne phagocytes for combating infection. Although passing over the transverse colon they take no part in supplying it.</p><p>Into the portal vein itself or its splenic and superior mesenteric tributaries (p. 351). One small vein without an accompanying artery is the prepyloric vein (of Mayo), which overlies the pylorus (to which it is a useful guide) and drains into the portal or right gastric veins.</p><p>All lymph eventually reaches celiac nodes after passing through various outlying groups. Lymph vessels anastomose freely in the stomach wall, but there are valves in the vessels that direct lymph in such a way that a line drawn parallel to the greater curvature and two-thirds of the way down the anterior surface indicates a watershed (Fig. 5.27B). From the largest zone above and to the right of this line, lymph passes to left and right gastric nodes along the lesser curvature adjacent to the blood vessels. From the upper left quadrant the lymph flows to splenic nodes at the hilum, which in turn drain to various pancreatic nodes associated with the pancreatic vessels. From the rest of the stomach lymph reaches nodes along the gastroepiploic vessels of the greater curvature and in the pyloric region (above, below and behind the pylorus). In rare cases of gastric carcinoma the left supraclavicular nodes may become palpably involved (Troisier&rsquo;s sign), presumably by spread through the posterior mediastinum.</p><h2 id=nerve-supply>Nerve Supply
<a class=anchor href=#nerve-supply>#</a></h2><p>Sympathetic fibers (vasomotor) accompanied by afferent (pain) fibers run with the various arterial branches to the stomach, but of greater importance is the parasympathetic supply from the vagi which control motility and secretion (although 90% of vagal fibers below the diaphragm are afferent for reflex activities, not pain). The anterior vagal trunk (from the esophageal plexuses - p. 261) at the esophageal opening in the diaphragm lies in contact with the anterior esophageal wall (Fig. 5.30), usually nearer its right margin than in the center; in 20% it is double. It runs down in the lesser omentum near the lesser curvature with the left gastric artery (where it is often called by clinicians the anterior nerve of Latarjet), giving branches to the anterior surface of the stomach and a large hepatic branch which in turn gives a branch to the pyloric antrum. (If the nerve is double, each gives a hepatic branch.) The posterior vagal trunk (Fig. 5.30) lies in loose tissue a little behind and to the right of the right esophageal margin, not in contact with the posterior surface of the esophagus. It runs in the lesser omentum behind the anterior trunk (as the posterior nerve of Latarjet), giving off a large celiac branch that runs backwards along the left gastric artery to the celiac ganglion, and numerous branches to the posterior surface of the stomach. The posterior trunk is rarely double (1%).</p><p>Fig. 5.30 Anterior and posterior vagal trunks and their main branches.</p><p><strong>Vagotomy.</strong> Truncal vagotomy involves cutting the trunks at the level of the abdominal esophagus. In selective vagotomy the branches to the stomach that run on or near the lesser curvature vessels are cut. Ligating vessels will inevitably sever some nerve branches but not all, since not all nerves accompany vessels closely, and any individual nerves that can be identified must be cut also. Arterial branches run into the lesser curvature transversely but nerve branches approach it obliquely. Although effective in diminishing gastric secretion, truncal and selective vagotomy are often accompanied by gastric stasis, so that an antral drainage procedure is required. Highly selective vagotomy (parietal cell vagotomy) attempts to avoid stasis by cutting only the branches to the fundus and body, leaving the antral nerves intact.</p><p><strong>Vomiting reflex.</strong> The vagi provide the afferent side of the vomiting reflex. Fibers pass to the vomiting center and chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema (part of the reticular formation - p. 611), from which reticulospinal fibers run to anterior horn cells for activating the diaphragm and abdominal muscles. Since the area postrema is outside the blood/brain barrier (p. 600) blood-borne drugs and other substances can induce vomiting, and the reticular formation connections with the cerebral cortex and limbic system (p. 588) account for the nausea and vomiting of emotional origin.</p><p>The main histological features are referred to on page 330. Although the angular notch is usually taken as the dividing line between the body and pyloric parts of the stomach, it is important to note that this does not necessarily indicate where the body-type of mucosa with its parietal (acid-secreting) cells gives way to the pyloric type with its concentration of G cells (producing gastrin). There is no landmark on the external surface to signal the change.</p><p>The outer longitudinal and inner circular muscle coats completely invest the stomach. They are reinforced by an incomplete innermost oblique muscle layer; its fibers loop over the fundus, being thickest at the notch between esophagus and stomach. They pass along the anterior and posterior walls in a direction oblique to the long axis of the organ, but they lie vertically when the trunk is erect, and thus obtain the best mechanical advantage for supporting the weight of gastric contents.</p><h2 id=gastrectomy>Gastrectomy
<a class=anchor href=#gastrectomy>#</a></h2><p>Partial gastrectomy (for peptic ulcer and tumor) involves removal of the distal two-thirds of the stomach, with the line of transection of the duodenum just beyond the pylorus. Among the anatomical hazards during mobilization of the stomach are the middle colic vessels, which must not be damaged when freeing the greater omentum from the adherent transverse colon and mesocolon. A gastroenterostomy to restore continuity can be made by bringing a loop of proximal jejunum through the transverse mesocolon to the left of the middle colic artery; the loop must lie isoperistaltically. The bile duct should be to the right of the line of transection of the duodenum. The left gastric artery is a larger vessel than the right gastric and should be doubly ligated. An accessory hepatic artery arising from the left gastric should be left intact; it may be the sole supply for the left lobe.</p><h2 id=small-intestine-1>Small Intestine
<a class=anchor href=#small-intestine-1>#</a></h2><p>The small intestine consists of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum, although clinically the term small intestine often excludes the duodenum.</p><h2 id=duodenum>Duodenum
<a class=anchor href=#duodenum>#</a></h2><p>The duodenum is a C-shaped tube (Fig. 5.29) curved over the convexity of the forwardly projecting aorta and inferior vena cava. The first 2 cm are contained between the peritoneum of the lesser and greater omenta, but the remainder is retroperitoneal. It is divided into four parts. They are properly called superior, descending, horizontal and ascending, but by long tradition they are respectively and more simply called first, second, third and fourth. The total length is 25 cm (10 in), the lengths of the parts being easily remembered in inches as 2, 3, 4 and 1 but less conveniently in centimeters (5, 7.5, 10 and 2.5).</p><p>The duodenum makes its C-shaped loop round the head of the pancreas, which is classically opposite the body of L2 vertebra, so the first part may be said to lie at the level of L1 vertebra, the second on the right side of L2, the third crosses the level of L3, and the fourth is on the left of L2. The whole duodenum according to this classical textbook description is thus above umbilical level (disc between L3 and L4), but in the living body (especially when upright) its parts may be at least one or more vertebral levels lower. The transpyloric plane (L1) is the guide to the surface marking.</p><p>The first part of the duodenum (Fig. 5.29) runs to the right, upwards and backwards from the pylorus; a foreshortened view is consequently obtained in sagittal radiographs (Fig. 5.28). The first 2 cm (i.e. the duodenal cap, see below) lies between the peritoneal folds of the greater and lesser omenta; it forms the lowermost boundary of the opening into the lesser sac (Fig. 5.38A). It lies upon the liver pedicle (bile duct, hepatic artery and portal vein). Behind this lies the inferior vena cava at the epiploic foramen. The neck of the gall bladder touches the upper convexity of the duodenal cap. The next 3 cm passes backwards and upwards on the right crus of the diaphragm and the right psoas muscle to the medial border of the right kidney. Its posterior surface is bare of peritoneum; this is to the right of the epiploic foramen (Fig. 5.17). It touches the upper part of the head of the pancreas and is covered in front with peritoneum of the posterior abdominal wall. The inferior surface of the right lobe of the liver lies over this peritoneum.</p><p>The second part of the duodenum curves downwards over the hilum of the right kidney (Fig. 5.29). It is covered in front with peritoneum, and crossed by the attachment of the transverse mesocolon, so that its upper half lies in the supracolic compartment to the left of the hepatorenal pouch (in contact with the liver) and its lower half lies in the right infracolic compartment medial to the inferior pole of the right kidney (in contact with coils of jejunum). It lies alongside the head of the pancreas, approximately at the level of L2 vertebra in a textbook cadaver, though frequently lower in life.</p><p>Its posteromedial wall receives the common opening of the bile duct and main pancreatic duct at the hepatopancreatic ampulla (of Vater), which opens into the lumen of the duodenum at the major duodenal papilla. The papilla lies about halfway along the second part, some 10 cm (4 in) from the pylorus. It is guarded by the semilunar flap of mucous membrane which surmounts it. Two cm (less than 1 in) proximal to the papilla is the small opening of the accessory pancreatic duct (at the minor duodenal papilla).</p><p>The third part of the duodenum curves forwards from the right paravertebral gutter over the slope of the right psoas muscle (gonadal vessels and ureter intervening) and passes over the forwardly projecting inferior vena cava and aorta to reach the left psoas muscle (Fig. 5.29). Its inferior border lies on the aorta at the commencement of the inferior mesenteric artery at the level of the umbilicus (disc between L3 and L4 vertebrae). Its upper border hugs the lower border of the pancreas. It is covered by the peritoneum of the posterior abdominal wall just below the transverse mesocolon. It is crossed by the superior mesenteric vessels and by the leaves of the commencement of the mesentery of the small intestine sloping down from the duodenojejunal flexure. It lies, therefore, in both right and left infracolic compartments (Fig. 5.17). Its anterior surface is in contact with coils of jejunum.</p><p>The fourth part of the duodenum ascends to the left of the aorta, lying on the left psoas muscle and left lumbar sympathetic trunk, to reach the lower border of the pancreas, almost as high as the root of the transverse mesocolon (L2 vertebra) (Fig. 5.29). It is covered in front by the peritoneal floor of the left infracolic compartment and by coils of jejunum. It breaks free from the peritoneum that has plastered it down to the posterior abdominal wall and curves forwards and to the right as the duodenojejunal flexure. This pulls up a double sheet of peritoneum from the posterior abdominal wall, the mesentery of the small intestine, which slopes down to the right across the third part of the duodenum and posterior abdominal wall (Fig. 5.17).</p><p>The duodenojejunal flexure is fixed to the left psoas fascia by fibrous tissue. It is said to be further supported by the suspensory muscle of the duodenum (muscle or ligament of Treitz). This is a thin band of smooth muscle; it descends from the right crus of the diaphragm in front of the aorta, behind the pancreas but in front of the renal vessels, and blends with the outer muscle coat of the flexure. It is often impossible to find the muscle.</p><p>Internally the mucous membrane of most of the duodenum, like the rest of the small intestine is thrown into numerous circular folds (plicae circulares or valvulae conniventes). But the walls of the first 2 cm are smooth, hence the smooth outline of the full shadow of barium in the duodenal cap at radiographic examination (Fig. 5.28). From the duodenal cap onwards the plicae break up the barium and its shadow.</p><p><strong>Paraduodenal recesses.</strong> To the left of the duodenojejunal flexure certain peritoneal folds and evaginations (recesses or fossae) are occasionally present. The most important surgically is the paraduodenal recess proper (Fig. 5.31). This is a small evagination of peritoneum beneath the upper end of the inferior mesenteric vein; an incarcerated hernia in this fossa may obstruct and thrombose the vein, and there is danger of dividing the vein if the peritoneum has to be divided at operation to free the hernia. Folds of peritoneum may rise from the floor of the infracolic compartment to both upper and lower convexities of the flexure; the fossae beneath such folds are known as the superior duodenal and inferior duodenal recesses respectively. Finally a retroduodenal recess may be excavated behind the flexure, between the superior and inferior recesses. The recesses are frequently called fossae.</p><p>Fig. 5.31 Peritoneal recesses of the duodenum. They are only occasionally present. The paraduodenal recess has the inferior mesenteric vein at the front of its opening.</p><p>It should be noted that the mouths of these four recesses all face inwards towards each other, and a hernia in any one may thus spread to involve others. This is not so with the cecal recesses, whose mouths all face away from each other (p. 339).</p><p>The duodenum is supplied by the superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries (p. 325), but the first 2 cm, clinically so important because of ulceration here, receive small branches from a variety of sources: hepatic, common hepatic, gastroduodenal, superior pancreaticoduodenal, right gastric and right gastroepiploic. There are corresponding veins, with some blood also entering the small prepyloric vein (p. 333).</p><p>Duodenal lymph drains by channels that accompany the superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal vessels to celiac and superior mesenteric nodes.</p><h2 id=jejunum-and-ileum>Jejunum and Ileum
<a class=anchor href=#jejunum-and-ileum>#</a></h2><p>The jejunum is wider-bored and thicker-walled than the ileum; but these differences are only relative, and a more useful method of distinguishing one from the other in the living is by rolling the wall of the intestine gently between finger and thumb. The wall of the jejunum is thick and double (the mucous membrane can be felt through the muscle wall, a shirt sleeve felt through a coat sleeve), while the wall of the ileum is thin and single (the mucous membrane cannot be felt as a separate layer).</p><p>The lower reaches of the ileum are distinguished by the presence on the antimesenteric border of elongated whitish plaques in the mucous membrane, usually but not always visible through the muscle wall. These are the aggregated lymphoid follicles (Peyer&rsquo;s patches). The jejunum lies coiled in the upper part of the infracolic compartment, the ileum in the lower part thereof and in the pelvis.</p><p>The jejunum and ileum together lie in the free margin of the mesentery. Total length varies greatly, from about 4 to 6 meters (13 to 20 feet) in the living. The jejunum constitutes rather less than half the total length, say two-fifths, allowing three-fifths for the ileum.</p><p>An ileal (Meckel&rsquo;s) diverticulum is present in 2% of individuals, 60 cm (2 feet) from the cecum and is 5 cm (2 in) long. This useful mnemonic is two-thirds true; the length of the diverticulum is very variable. Its blind end may contain gastric mucosa or liver or pancreatic tissue. It represents the intestinal end of the vitellointestinal duct, and its apex may be adherent to the umbilicus or connected thereto by a fibrous cord, a further remnant of the duct. Ulceration and perforation of the tip can occur.</p><h2 id=blood-supply-1>Blood Supply
<a class=anchor href=#blood-supply-1>#</a></h2><p>Numerous jejunal and ileal branches arise from the left side of the superior mesenteric artery (p. 327) and enter the mesentery by passing between the two layers of the root. The jejunal branches join each other in a series of anastomosing loops to form arterial arcades - single for the upper jejunum and double lower down. From the arcades, straight arteries pass to the mesenteric border of the gut (Fig. 5.32). These vessels are long and close together, forming high narrow windows in the intestinal border of the mesentery, visible because the mesenteric fat does not reach thus far. The straight vessels pass to one or other side of the jejunum and sink into its wall. Occlusion of a straight artery may lead to infarction of the segment supplied because these are end arteries, but occlusion of arcade vessels is usually without effect due to their numerous anastomotic connections.</p><p>Fig. 5.32 Arcades of the superior mesenteric artery: A in the jejunum; B in the ileum. Compare the high narrow windows between the vasa recta running to the wall of the jejunum with the low broad windows between those of the ileum.</p><p>The ileal arteries are similar but form a larger series of arcades - three to five, the most distal lying near the ileal wall so that the straight vessels branching off the arcades are shorter. There is more fat in this part of the mesentery, so the windows characteristic of the jejunal part are not seen - a useful feature in identifying loops of bowel.</p><p>The end of the superior mesenteric artery itself supplies the region of the ileal diverticulum (if present), and anastomoses with the arcades and with the ileocolic branch to supply the terminal ileum.</p><p>The veins all correspond to the arteries and thus drain to the superior mesenteric.</p><p>Jejunal and ileal lymph drains to superior mesenteric nodes via the groups already described (p. 328).</p><p>The parasympathetic vagal supply of the small intestine reaches the intestinal wall with its blood vessels and normally augments peristaltic activity. There are many afferent fibers whose function is unknown; they do not transmit pain impulses which, as with the stomach and other viscera, use sympathetic pathways. The sympathetic supply, which is vasoconstrictor and normally inhibits peristalsis, is from the lateral horn cells of spinal segments T9 and 10; small intestinal pain is usually felt in the umbilical region of the abdomen. See also page 329.</p><h2 id=large-intestine-1>Large Intestine
<a class=anchor href=#large-intestine-1>#</a></h2><p>The large intestine consists of the cecum with the worm-shaped (vermiform) appendix, the ascending, transverse, descending and sigmoid parts of the colon, the rectum and the anal canal.</p><p>This blind pouch of the large intestine projects downwards from the commencement of the ascending colon, below the ileocecal junction (Fig. 5.33A). Over the front and on both sides it is covered with peritoneum. The serous coat continues up behind it and is reflected downwards to the floor of the right iliac fossa. The retrocecal peritoneal space may be shallow or deep according to the distance of the retrocecal fold from the lower end of the cecum. The space may be continuous across the iliac fossa or it may be interrupted by a peritoneal fold from one or other side of the posterior wall of the cecum. Often there are two cecal folds, forming between them the retrocecal recess in which the appendix may lie. As in the rest of the colon, the longitudinal muscle of the cecum is concentrated into three flat bands, the taeniae coli, between which the circular muscle layer constitutes the sacculated wall of the gut. The taeniae lie one anterior, one posteromedial and one posterolateral. All three converge on the base of the appendix — a useful guide.</p><p>In the infant the cecum is conical and the appendix extends downwards from its apex. The lateral wall outgrows the medial wall and bulges down below the base of the appendix in the adult; the base of the appendix thus comes to lie in the posteromedial wall of the cecum above its lower end, and the three taeniae converge to this point (Fig. 5.33). The terminal inch or so (say 2 cm) of the ileum is commonly adherent to the left convexity of the cecum, below the ileocecal junction.</p><p>The cecum lies on the peritoneal floor of the right iliac fossa, over the iliacus and psoas fasciae and the femoral nerve. Its lower end lies at the pelvic brim. When distended its anterior surface touches the parietal peritoneum of the anterior abdominal wall; when collapsed coils of ileum lie between the two.</p><p><strong>Blood supply.</strong> Various branches of the anterior and posterior cecal vessels fan out over the respective sides of the cecum. The anterior cecal artery is the smaller of the two terminal branches of the ileocolic artery (p. 327), and ramifies over the anterior surface. The posterior cecal artery is larger and supplies the rest of the cecum, and it also usually gives off the appendicular artery. There are corresponding veins.</p><p>The appendix is a worm-shaped, blind-ending tube (Fig. 5.33) varying in length from 2 to 25 cm (commonly about 6 to 9 cm), which opens into the posteromedial wall of the cecum 2 cm below the ileocecal valve (Fig. 5.33B). Externally the base of the appendix is at the point of convergence of the three taeniae coli on the posteromedial wall of the cecum (an important guide in appendicectomy, see below). On the surface of the abdomen this point (McBurney&rsquo;s) lies one-third of the way up the oblique line that joins the right anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus. The three taeniae merge into a complete longitudinal muscle layer for the appendix. While the position of the base of the appendix is constant in relation to the cecum (though perhaps a little lower than McBurney&rsquo;s point), the tip may lie in a variety of positions (Fig. 5.33C). The commonest as found at operation are the retrocecal and retrocolic positions, but recent scanning studies suggest that a retroileal site is the commonest in the absence of disease. The appendiceal lumen is relatively wide in the young child but may be obliterated in old age.</p><p>The appendix has its own short mesentery, the mesoappendix, which is a triangular fold of peritoneum and is a prolongation of the left (inferior) layer of the mesentery of the terminal ileum (Fig. 5.33A).</p><p>B

C Various positions of the appendix, including (in interrupted line) retrocecal and retrocolic positions.</p><p><strong>Blood supply.</strong> The appendicular artery is normally a branch of the posterior cecal (and may be double). It runs first in the free margin of the mesoappendix and then close to the appendicular wall. Inflammatory swelling of the distal part of the organ may thus obstruct the vessel, leading to ischemic necrosis and perhaps rupture of the appendix; there is no collateral circulation, for the appendicular artery is an end artery (unlike the cystic artery of the gall bladder, which is supplemented by vessels from the gall bladder bed, (p. 348). There are corresponding veins.</p><p><strong>Lymph drainage.</strong> As from the cecum lymph passes to nodes associated with the ileocolic artery (p. 328).</p><p><strong>Appendicectomy.</strong> Through a McBurney or transverse muscle-splitting incision (p. 311), the peritoneal cavity is opened and the whole length of the appendix identified. If it is not immediately obvious, tracing any of the taeniae down over the cecal wall will lead to the base of the appendix. The whole organ is mobilized, often requiring very delicate loosening of adhesions, and the mesoappendix divided before the base is crushed and divided and the rest of it removed. The stump is invaginated with a pursestring suture.</p><p>Apart from the cecal folds that form the retrocecal recess (p. 338), other small peritoneal folds are often found in the region of the terminal ileum, cecum and base of the appendix, forming further recesses or fossae. The most anterior fold lies in front of the terminal ileum between the base of the mesentery and the anterior wall of the cecum, and is raised up by the contained anterior cecal artery; hence the fold is called the vascular fold of the cecum. The space behind it is the ileocecal recess. Another fold may run from the terminal ileum towards the base of the appendix and mesoappendix. This is the ileocecal fold (formerly called the bloodless fold of Treves, but this is a misnomer as it frequently contains small vessels) (Fig. 5.33A), and the space behind it (in front of the mesoappendix) is the inferior ileocecal recess (Fig. 5.33A). Thus three parallel folds of peritoneum enclose two ileocecal recesses between them. Between the mesoappendix and the peritoneal floor of the right iliac fossa there is often a third recess and, finally, the retrocecal fossa when present constitutes a fourth. The mouths of these four recesses face away from each other, unlike the mouths of the paraduodenal fossae (p. 336).</p><h2 id=colon>Colon
<a class=anchor href=#colon>#</a></h2><p>Of the four parts of the colon, the transverse and sigmoid parts are suspended in mesenteries - the transverse mesocolon and sigmoid mesocolon respectively - but the ascending and descending colon are plastered on to the posterior abdominal wall so that they have posterior bare areas devoid of peritoneum.</p><h2 id=ascending-colon>Ascending Colon
<a class=anchor href=#ascending-colon>#</a></h2><p>This first part of the colon, about 15 cm (6 in) in length extends upwards from the ileocecal junction to the right colic (hepatic) flexure. The latter lies on the lateral surface of the inferior pole of the right kidney, in contact with the inferior surface of the liver. The ascending colon lies on the iliac fascia and the anterior layer of the lumbar fascia, being connected and fixed to them by extraperitoneal fibrous tissue. Its front and both sides possess a serous coat, which runs laterally into the paracolic gutter and medially into the right infracolic compartment. Its original embryonic mesentery, which is retained in about 10% of adults, hinged across from the midline and became adherent to the peritoneum of the posterior abdominal wall, bringing the ileocolic and right colic vessels within its folds. These vessels thus lie, in the adult, immediately beneath the peritoneum of the right infracolic compartment.</p><p>The taeniae coli lie, in line with those of the cecum, anteriorly, posterolaterally and posteromedially. These consist of longitudinal muscle fibers and the circular muscle coat is exposed between them. The ascending colon is sacculated, due to the three taeniae being too short for the bowel. If the taeniae are divided between the sacculations the latter can be drawn apart and the bowel wall flattened.</p><p>Bulbous pouches of peritoneum, distended with fat, the appendices epiploicae, project in places from the serous coat. The blood vessels supplying them from the mucosa perforate the muscle wall. Mucous membrane may herniate through these vascular perforations, a condition known as diverticulosis. Diverticulitis is inflammation of these mucosal hernias.</p><h2 id=transverse-colon>Transverse Colon
<a class=anchor href=#transverse-colon>#</a></h2><p>This part of the colon, normally over 45 cm (18 in) long, extends from the hepatic to the splenic flexure in a loop which hangs down to a variable degree between these two fixed points. It is in contact with the anterior abdominal wall. The convexity of the greater curvature of the stomach lies in its concavity, the two being connected by the gastrocolic omentum. Because of the fusion between the greater omentum and the transverse mesocolon and transverse colon, the greater omentum appears to hang down from its lower convexity, in front of the coils of small intestine. The transverse colon is completely invested in peritoneum; it hangs free on the transverse mesocolon, which is attached from the inferior pole of the right kidney across the descending (second) part of the duodenum and the pancreas to the inferior pole of the left kidney. The splenic flexure lies, at a higher level than the hepatic flexure, well up under cover of the left costal margin.</p><p>The taeniae coli continue from the ascending colon. Due to the looping downwards and forwards of the transverse colon from the flexures, which lie well back in the paravertebral gutters, some rotation of the gut wall occurs at the flexures, and the anterior taenia of ascending and descending colons lies posteriorly, while the other two lie anteriorly, above and below. The appendices epiploicae are larger and more numerous than on the ascending colon.</p><h2 id=descending-colon>Descending Colon
<a class=anchor href=#descending-colon>#</a></h2><p>Less than 30 cm (12 in) long, this extends from the splenic flexure to the pelvic brim, and in the whole of its course is plastered to the posterior abdominal wall by peritoneum (like the ascending colon), though a mesentery is present in about 20% of adults. It lies on the lumbar fascia and the iliac fascia, being connected to them by extraperitoneal fibrous tissue. It ends at the pelvic brim about 5 cm (2 in) above the inguinal ligament.</p><p>The three taeniae coli, in continuity with those of the transverse colon, lie one anterior and two posterior (medial and lateral). Appendices epiploicae are numerous and diverticulosis is common in this part of the colon.</p><p>In the embryo the descending colon possessed a midline dorsal mesocolon containing the left colic vessels between its layers. The mesocolon hinged to the left like a door and became fused with the parietal peritoneum of the posterior abdominal wall (Fig. 5.23); thus in the adult the peritoneal floor of the left infracolic compartment is the right leaf of the original dorsal mesocolon, and the left colic vessels lie immediately beneath it.</p><h2 id=sigmoid-colon>Sigmoid Colon
<a class=anchor href=#sigmoid-colon>#</a></h2><p>Formerly known as the pelvic colon, this extends from the descending colon at the pelvic brim to the commencement of the rectum in front of the third piece of the sacrum. It is completely invested in the peritoneum (like the transverse colon) and hangs free on a mesentery, the sigmoid mesocolon. It is usually less than 45 cm (18 in) long, though great variations in length are common. There is no change in the gut wall between terminal sigmoid colon and upper rectum; the distinction is only for peritoneal attachment. Where there is a mesentery the gut is called sigmoid. Where the mesentery ceases the gut is called rectum. Compare with the duodenojejunal junction (p. 336).</p><p>The sigmoid mesocolon in the embryo had originally a midline dorsal attachment. It hinged to the left like that of the descending colon and became partially, but not completely, fused with the parietal peritoneum of the posterior abdominal and pelvic wall. The part remaining free is joined to the parietal peritoneum along a A-shaped base (Fig. 5.17). The limbs of the ^ diverge from the bifurcation of the common iliac artery, over the sacroiliac joint at the pelvic brim. The lateral limb is attached to the external iliac artery along the pelvic brim from this point halfway to the inguinal ligament, a distance of about 5 cm (2 in). The medial limb extends from the bifurcation of the common iliac artery to the midline of the posterior pelvic wall at the level of the third piece of the sacrum, for about the same distance. The base of the sigmoid mesocolon thus measures about 10 cm (4 in) but its intestinal border and therefore the length of the sigmoid colon is four times as long. The sigmoid vessels lie between the layers of the mesocolon.</p><h2 id=blood-supply-of-the-colon>Blood Supply of the Colon
<a class=anchor href=#blood-supply-of-the-colon>#</a></h2><p>The ascending colon and the proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon are supplied by the ileocolic, right colic and middle colic branches of the superior mesenteric artery, and the remainder of the colon by the left colic and sigmoid branches of the inferior mesenteric (p. 328). The anastomotic branches near the medial margin of the whole colon form the arterial circle commonly called (unofficially) the marginal artery and it is from this that short vessels run into the gut wall. The weakest link in this marginal chain of vessels is near the left colic flexure, between the middle and left colic branches, i.e. between midgut and hindgut vessels (and not, as was previously believed, between left colic and sigmoid branches).</p><h2 id=lymph-drainage-2>Lymph Drainage
<a class=anchor href=#lymph-drainage-2>#</a></h2><p>As is usual the lymph channels follow the blood vessels, so that drainage is to superior or inferior mesenteric nodes (p. 328).</p><h2 id=nerve-supply-1>Nerve Supply
<a class=anchor href=#nerve-supply-1>#</a></h2><p>Being derived from the midgut (up to near the splenic flexure) and the hindgut (from there onwards), the parasympathetic supply to the large intestine is partly from the vagi and partly from the pelvic splanchnic nerves. The sympathetic supply is derived from spinal cord segments T10-L2. The pain fibers that accompany these vasoconstrictor nerves give rise to periumbilical pain if from midgut derivatives (e.g. the appendix) but to hypogastric pain if from the hindgut. As from the rectum, some pain fibers from the descending and sigmoid colon appear to run with the parasympathetic nerves (see also p. 380).</p><h2 id=colectomy>Colectomy
<a class=anchor href=#colectomy>#</a></h2><p>The vessel pattern with the accompanying lymphatics determines the extent of partial resections of the colon for carcinoma (Fig. 5.34). For a right hemicolectomy the resection extends from the terminal ileum to the proximal part of the transverse colon, with ligation of the ileocolic and right colic vessels adjacent to superior mesenteric parent. In a transverse colectomy the transverse colon and the right and left colic flexures are removed together with the transverse mesocolon and greater omentum and the middle colic vessels. For a left hemicolectomy the resection is from the left end of the transverse colon to part of the sigmoid colon, with ligation of left colic and sigmoid vessels, but the inferior mesenteric itself may have to be removed. For sigmoid colectomy the removal extends from the lower descending colon to the rectum. Resections for diverticular disease (as opposed to neoplasia) can of course be more localized.</p><p>Fig. 5.34 Extent of large bowel resection for the two commonest partial colectomies: right hemicolectomy and sigmoid colectomy.</p><p>The rectum is considered with the pelvic organs on page 377, and the anal canal with the perineum on page 401.</p><p>The liver, the largest gland in the body, weighs 1500 g and receives 1500 ml of blood per minute. Its form has nothing to do with its function; the large wedge-shaped mass (Fig. 5.35) is merely a cast of the cavity into which it grows. It has two surfaces, diaphragmatic and visceral. The diaphragmatic surface is boldly convex, molded to the under surface of the diaphragm, but is subdivided into anterior, superior, posterior and right surfaces which merge into one another without any clear demarcations, except where the sharp inferior border is formed. The visceral (or inferior) surface is rather flat and slopes downwards, forwards and to the right from the posterior surface, but again there is no clear dividing line. In the hardened dissecting room specimen this surface bears faint impressions from adjacent viscera. The junction of the visceral and anterior surfaces makes the sharp inferior border of the organ. Most main vessels and ducts enter or leave at the porta hepatis which is on the visceral surface, but the hepatic veins emerge from the posterior surface.</p><p>From the diaphragmatic and visceral surfaces peritoneal folds pass respectively across to the diaphragm and down to the stomach; these persist from the ventral mesogastrium into which the developing liver grows (Fig. 5.20).</p><p>The diaphragmatic surface is for the most part covered in peritoneum, which peels off in places to join the adjacent diaphragm. The anterior surface, viewed from the front (Fig. 5.35A), is triangular and related to the diaphragm, lungs and pleura (especially on the right), to ribs and costal cartilages 6-10 on the right, and to costal cartilages 6 and 7 on the left. Part of this surface lies behind the infracostal angle and is therefore covered by the anterior abdominal wall of the epigastrium. Above, the anterior surface curves backwards to become the superior surface which lies against the diaphragm with above it the pericardium and heart centrally and the pleura and lung on each side. The sharp lower border slopes up from right to left, first along the right costal margin and then across the epigastrium.</p><p>The convexities of the superior and right surfaces continue into the posterior surface which lower down becomes the visceral or inferior surface (Figs 5.35B and 5.36). These latter two surfaces can be considered together when viewing the liver from behind (Fig. 5.35B). Their main feature is an H-shaped pattern of structures. Centrally lies the porta hepatis (the hilum of the liver), the cross-piece of the H. The right limb (incomplete) of the H is made by the inferior vena cava (on the posterior surface) and the gall bladder (inferior surface), while the left limb is made by the continuity of the fissures for the ligamentum venosum and ligamentum teres. The vena cava lies in a deep groove or sometimes a tunnel, on the convexity of.</p><p>A

All peritoneal edges seen here are attached to the diaphragm. B Posterior view (posterior and visceral surfaces). The lesser omentum, whose cut edges are seen in the fissure for the ligamentum venosum and which continues round the structures in the porta hepatis, is attached to the lesser curvature of the stomach. All other peritoneal edges seen here are attached to the diaphragm. The caudate process connects the caudate lobe to the right lobe.</p><p>Fig. 5.35B</p><p>Fig. 5.36 Visceral surface of the liver, as seen when looking into the abdomen with the lower border of the liver lifted up towards the costal margin.</p><p>The features considered to belong to the visceral surface (Fig. 5.35B) are the porta hepatis and the lesser omentum extending into the fissure for the ligamentum venosum, impressions for parts of the right kidney and suprarenal gland, second part of the duodenum and right colic flexure, the gall bladder, the quadrate lobe, the fissure for the ligamentum teres and the rest of the gastric impression.</p><p>The normal or even the enlarged liver never falls down into the abdominal cavity. It is supported by the hepatic veins and the inferior vena cava. The hepatic veins (see below) are entirely intrahepatic and enter the vena cava while it is clasped in the deep groove on the posterior surface. At a postmortem examination the liver cannot be displaced caudally until the inferior vena cava is divided below the diaphragm. The thin inferior border of the liver is prevented from tilting downwards by the attachments of the left triangular ligament and the ligamentum teres and by resting on the underlying viscera (stomach and hepatic flexure of the colon).</p><p>Projected to the surface when viewed from the front, the upper margin of the liver is approximately level with the xiphisternal joint, arching slightly upwards on each side. On the left it reaches the fifth intercostal space 7-8 cm from the midline, and on the right to the fifth rib, curving down to the right border which extends from ribs 7 to 11 in the midaxillary line. The inferior border is along a line joining the right lower and upper left extremities; some of it thus lies approximately level with the right costal margin, while centrally it crosses behind the upper abdominal wall between the costal margins.</p><h2 id=lobes>Lobes
<a class=anchor href=#lobes>#</a></h2><p>The lobes of the liver are left, caudate, quadrate and right (Fig. 5.35B). At the front and above, the falciform ligament divides the anatomical left and right lobes. At the back, the caudate lobe lies between the inferior vena cava and the fissure for the ligamentum venosum, and is connected to the right lobe (to the right of the inferior vena cava) by an isthmus of liver substance, the caudate process. The quadrate lobe lies between the gall bladder fossa and the fissure for the ligamentum teres. The old anatomists considered the caudate and quadrate lobes to be part of the right lobe, but it is of the utmost importance to appreciate that functionally the caudate lobe and most of the quadrate lobe belong to the left lobe; they receive their blood supply from the left branches of the hepatic artery and portal vein and deliver their bile to the left hepatic duct. The old anatomists knew that the right and left hepatic ducts are of equal diameter, as are the right and left branches of the hepatic artery and portal vein, but they failed to understand the functional division into two equal halves. The division runs along the plane of the gall bladder and the inferior vena cava.</p><h2 id=segments>Segments
<a class=anchor href=#segments>#</a></h2><p>On the basis of blood supply and biliary drainage (see below), there are four main anatomical segments: left lateral and left medial, right anterior and right posterior. The left lateral segment corresponds to the left anatomical lobe, and the left medial segment to the caudate and most of the quadrate lobe, with the line of the fissures for the ligamentum venosum and ligamentum teres demarcating these segments from one another. The line of demarcation of the functional right lobe from the rest of the liver is along the vena caval groove and the gall bladder fossa at the back, but at the front there is no visible landmark; the plane of division lies well to the right of the falciform ligament. The right anterior and posterior segments again have no visible external marking, but the line of division runs obliquely and medially from the middle of the front of the right lobe towards the vena caval groove.</p><p>Liver experts now tend to refer to the above anatomical segments as sectors, and use the word segment for the subdivisions of these sectors based on the pattern of blood vessels divisions (which can be confirmed by modern scanning methods). A system using Roman numerals I-VIII is commonly adopted (Fig. 5.37). Segment I is the caudate lobe at the back. Segment II corresponds to the left lateral sector, and segments III and IV to lateral and medial parts of the left medial sector. Segments V and VIII are the lower and upper parts of the right anterior sector, and segments VI and VII are the lower and upper parts of the right posterior sector. Further details can be found in specialist texts.</p><p>The liver receives blood from two sources. Arterial (oxygenated) blood is furnished by the hepatic artery (p. 324), which divides into right and left branches in the porta hepatis. The division is Y-shaped, in contrast to the T-shaped division of the right and left branches of the portal vein. The right branch of the hepatic artery normally passes behind the common hepatic duct and in the liver divides into anterior and posterior segmental branches; the left branch divides into medial and lateral segmental branches. Sometimes the common hepatic artery arises from the superior mesenteric artery or the aorta (instead of the celiac trunk), in which case it usually runs behind the portal vein. The right and left hepatic branches may themselves arise from the superior mesenteric or left gastric arteries respectively, constituting the aberrant hepatic arteries. They may either replace the normal branches or exist in addition to them; the commonest is a left hepatic artery arising from the left gastric (in over 20% of bodies).</p><p>Fig. 5.37 Main hepatic veins and approximate positions of surgical segments, indicated by Roman numerals (posterior segments are in brackets). See text for explanation.</p><p>Venous blood is carried to the liver by the portal vein (p. 351) which divides in the porta hepatis into right and left branches which in turn give segmental branches like the arteries; this portal blood is laden with the products of digestion which have been absorbed from the alimentary canal, and which are metabolized by the liver cells.</p><p>The hepatic artery and portal vein are everywhere accompanied by tributaries of the hepatic ducts; the three together lie in portal canals of histological sections. There is no communication between right and left halves of the liver; indeed, even within each half the arteries are end arteries (hence infarction of the liver). Although infarction may illustrate this point, in the presence of disease there are often enough anastomoses with phrenic vessels (e.g. across the bare area) to provide a collateral circulation that is sufficient to allow ligation of the hepatic artery, a procedure that has been used to induce metastases to regress without compromising normal liver tissue (though with less success than was hoped). From the portal canals the blood passes into the sinusoids between the rows of liver cells to the center of each lobule. The arterial and portal venous blood become mixed in the sinusoids and then pass into the central vein in the center of each lobule. The central veins of all the lobules unite to form the hepatic veins.</p><p>The venous return differs in that it shows a mixing of right and left halves of the liver. Three main hepatic veins (Fig. 5.37), high up near the diaphragmatic surface, drain into the inferior vena cava. A large central vein runs in the plane between right and left halves and receives from each. Further laterally lie a right and left vein; the middle vein frequently (60%) joins the left very near the vena cava. All the veins have no extrahepatic course and enter the vena cava just below the central tendon of the diaphragm. The entry of these large hepatic veins into the vena cava, already embedded in its deep groove of liver substance, is the main support for the liver (rather than the peritoneal ligaments). Several small accessory hepatic veins enter the vena cava below the main veins, including a separate vein from the caudate lobe.</p><p>The lymphatics of the liver drain into three or four nodes that lie in the porta hepatis (hepatic nodes). These nodes also receive the lymphatics of the gall bladder. They drain downwards alongside the hepatic artery to retropyloric nodes and so to the celiac nodes. In some cases of carcinoma of the pylorus the retropyloric nodes become involved in spread of the disease, the afferent lymphatics become dilated, and retrograde spread of carcinoma may then involve the hepatic nodes. In such cases pressure of these nodes on a hepatic duct gives rise to obstructive jaundice. From the bare area the surface of the liver communicates with extraperitoneal lymphatics which perforate the diaphragm and drain to nodes in the posterior mediastinum. Similar communications exist along the left triangular and falciform ligaments from the adjacent liver surfaces.</p><p>The nerve supply of the liver is derived from both the sympathetic and vagus, the former by way of the celiac ganglia, whence nerves run with the vessels in the free edge of the lesser omentum and enter the porta hepatis. Vagal fibers from the left vagal trunk reach the porta hepatis along the lesser curve of the stomach via the lesser omentum.</p><p>The classic description of liver morphology is centered on the liver lobule, a region of liver tissue of something like pinhead size and hexagonal shape, with a central vein as the central feature, and with sinusoids and plates or cords of hepatocytes radiating from it to the periphery of the lobule where there may be fine connective tissue septa separating it from adjacent lobules (though in the human liver the septa are poorly developed compared with those in many animals such as the pig, whose liver is frequently studied histologically to demonstrate the typical pattern). At the corners of the lobules small branches of the hepatic artery and portal vein are gathered with bile ductules, forming the portal canals. The vascular and biliary channels of the portal canals are united by anastomosing connections which, although not obvious on histological sections, are fundamental to the concept of the functional unit of the liver being the acinus rather than the lobule. The acinus on section is a diamond-shaped area with central veins at one pair of opposite corners and portal canals at the other pair, i.e. the acinus consists of parts of two adjacent lobules. The functional implication is that the hepatocytes of the region between the canals are the first to come under the influence of the incoming blood supply, whereas those nearest the central veins are the last to do so.</p><p>Trations. These allow plasma (but not blood cells) to leave the sinusoids and enter the perisinusoidal spaces between the endothelium and hepatocytes, so that exchange of materials can take place between plasma and liver cells. Thus, contrary to common belief, the hepatocytes are not bathed in whole blood but only in plasma. Many of the endothelial lining cells are capable of phagocytic activity, constituting the Kupffer cells of the reticuloendothelial system. Bile manufactured by hepatocytes first enters the biliary canaliculi which are situated between apposing sides of adjacent hepatocytes. Collectively the canaliculi form a meshwork which drains into the bile ductules of the portal canals, and these in turn unite to form the larger intrahepatic ducts.</p><h2 id=development>Development
<a class=anchor href=#development>#</a></h2><p>The liver develops by proliferation of cells from the blind ends of a Y-shaped diverticulum which grows from the foregut into the septum transversum. The cranial part of the septum transversum becomes the pericardium and diaphragm. The caudal part becomes the ventral mesogastrium (Fig. 5.20), and it is into this that the liver grows (p. 322). At this stage the caudal part of the septum transversum transmits the vitelline veins which, by numerous anastomoses, form a rich venous plexus here. The proliferating liver cells break into branching buds of hepatocytes that form an anastomosing network whose meshes become filled with sinusoidal venous channels draining to the vitelline veins.</p><p>The original diverticulum from the endoderm of the foregut (Fig. 5.40A) becomes the bile duct; its Y-shaped bifurcation produces the right and left hepatic ducts. A blind diverticulum from the bile duct becomes the cystic duct and gall bladder (Fig. 5.40B). The hepatic ducts divide and redivide to become the interlobular and intralobular bile ductules. Hepatic circulation in the fetus is referred to on page 46.</p><p>Needle biopsy of the liver is carried out through the right eighth or ninth intercostal space in the midaxillary line; the needle path is below the level of the lung but traverses the costodiaphragmatic recess of the pleura before going through the diaphragm and crossing the peritoneal cavity to enter the liver. The needle must not penetrate more than 6 cm from the skin to avoid entering the inferior vena cava. A misplaced needle could damage the kidney, colon or pancreas, and pneumothorax is another possible complication.</p><p>A right hepatic lobectomy involves removing liver tissue along a line from the left of the gall bladder to the right edge of the inferior vena cava, ligating vessels and ducts along the way so that the right lobe and the gall bladder can be removed. For left lobectomy, the left lobe together with most of the caudate and quadrate lobes are removed. The gall bladder is left intact, and the line of resection at the back is level with the left edge of the vena cava. In left lobectomy it is important to preserve the right hepatic vein and vice versa. More precise removal of segments can be carried out based on their detailed vascular patterns.</p><p>In liver transplantation following removal of the patient&rsquo;s liver, the suprahepatic inferior vena cava of the donor liver is sutured to the patient&rsquo;s (but remains clamped), followed by reunion of the portal veins with restoration of circulation so that blood flows out of the lower end of the donor vena cava before joining it to the patient&rsquo;s infrahepatic vena cava. The suprahepatic vena cava is then unclamped, and the respective hepatic arteries and bile ducts joined up. Portal blood must flow through the liver to flush out accumulated potassium ions which are a potential cause of cardiac arrest; this is why the superior vena cava is kept clamped until the portal circulation has been restored. The viability of the bile duct is an important factor for a successful transplant; the cut end of the donor duct should bleed when the hepatic circulation is restored.</p><p>The extrahepatic biliary tract consists of the three hepatic ducts (right, left and common), the gall bladder and cystic duct, and the bile duct. Bile is manufactured by the liver cells. It is collected in bile canaliculi in the lobules, flows along the portal canals in the bile duct tributaries and so reaches the right and left hepatic ducts, which emerge at the porta hepatis. Here they join, and the common hepatic duct so formed passes down between the two peritoneal layers at the free edge of the lesser omentum. The common hepatic duct is soon joined by the cystic duct from the gall bladder, to form the bile duct (Fig. 5.38A). When retracted at operation the ducts descend below the liver, but at rest they lie in loose contact with the porta hepatis.</p><p>The gall bladder stores and concentrates the bile secreted by the liver. It is a globular or pear-shaped viscus (Figs 5.35B and 5.36) with a capacity of about 50 ml, and consists of three parts - fundus, body and neck. It lies in the gall bladder fossa on the visceral surface of the right lobe of the liver, adjacent to the.</p><p>Its bulbous blind end, the fundus, projects a little beyond the sharp lower border of the liver and touches the parietal peritoneum of the anterior abdominal wall at the tip of the ninth costal cartilage, where the transpyloric plane crosses the right costal margin, at the lateral border of the right rectus sheath (Fig. 5.1). This is the surface marking for the fundus and the area of abdominal tenderness in gall bladder disease. (The fundus of the normal gall bladder is not palpable but may become so if distended by biliary tract obstruction.) The fundus lies on the commencement of the transverse colon, just to the left of the hepatic flexure. The body passes backwards and upwards towards the right end of the porta hepatis and is in contact with the first part of the duodenum (hence the staining of the duodenum by bile in dissecting room specimens). The upper end of the body narrows into the neck which, when the liver is in its normal position (not retracted upwards), lies at a higher level than the fundus and against the free edge of the lesser omentum. The neck continues into the cystic duct, which is 2-3 cm long and 2-3 mm in diameter. It runs towards the porta to join the common hepatic duct (so forming the bile duct) between the two layers of peritoneum that form the free edge of the lesser omentum (Fig. 5.38A) about 1 cm above the duodenum and usually in front of the right hepatic artery and its cystic branch (but variations are common - see Bile duct, below). The wall of the neck where it joins the cystic duct may show a small diverticulum (Hartmann&rsquo;s pouch) which may become the site of impaction of a gallstone. However, this is not a feature of the normal gall bladder and is always associated with a pathological condition.</p><p>The fundus and body of the gall bladder are firmly bound to the under surface of the liver by connective tissue and many small cystic veins that pass from the gall bladder into the liver substance. The peritoneum covering the liver passes smoothly over the gall bladder. Occasionally the gall bladder hangs free on a narrow mesentery from the under surface of the liver, a condition that greatly facilitates cholecystectomy.</p><p>The gall bladder receives many small vessels from its hepatic bed, but there is also a cystic artery (Fig. 5.38A), usually a branch of the right hepatic. It passes behind the cystic duct to reach the neck of the gall bladder and then branches out over the surface of the viscus. The artery should be found running towards the gall bladder in the triangle formed by the liver, common hepatic duct and cystic duct (Calot&rsquo;s triangle), but variations in the origin of the artery are common. It may arise from the main trunk of the hepatic artery, from the left branch of that vessel or from the gastroduodenal artery, and in either case may pass in front of the cystic and bile ducts. Thrombosis of the cystic artery does not usually lead to ischemia of the gall bladder because the supply from the gall bladder bed is adequate (in contrast to the appendix, whose supply is by an end artery, p. 339).</p><p>A

Its mucous membrane is a lax areolar tissue lined with a simple columnar epithelium. It is projected into folds which produce a honeycomb appearance in the body of the gall bladder, but are arranged in a more or less spiral manner in the neck (the spiral valve of Heister) just short of the cystic duct. Mucus is secreted by the columnar epithelium but there are no goblet cells, and mucus-secreting glands are present only in the neck.</p><h2 id=common-hepatic-duct>Common Hepatic Duct
<a class=anchor href=#common-hepatic-duct>#</a></h2><p>The right and left hepatic ducts emerge from the porta hepatis and unite near its right margin in a Y-shaped manner to form the common hepatic duct. This is joined, usually after about 3 cm (but in Fig. 5.38A it is unusually short), by the cystic duct to form the bile duct. The common hepatic duct is about 4 cm long with a diameter of 4 mm; it lies in the free edge of the lesser omentum, in front of the right edge of the portal vein and with the hepatic artery on its left. The right branch of the hepatic artery normally passes behind the common hepatic duct but may run in front of it. The site of union of the cystic and common hepatic ducts is usually on the right side of the common hepatic duct about 1 cm above the duodenum, but sometimes the cystic duct runs parallel to and on the right of the hepatic duct for a variable distance before uniting with it, and it may also spiral round behind the hepatic duct before joining it on its left side. All these possibilities must be borne in mind when dissecting out the cystic duct during cholecystectomy; obviously correct identification of the various ducts is vital.</p><p>The bile duct (formerly called the common bile duct) is about 8 cm long and 8 mm in diameter, and is best described in three parts or thirds. The upper (supraduodenal) third lies in the free edge of the lesser omentum (Fig. 5.38) in the most accessible position for surgery - in front of the portal vein and to the right of the hepatic artery, where the lesser omentum forms the anterior boundary of the epiploic foramen. Here it may be incised (choledochotomy) for removal of a stone or insertion of a drainage tube. The middle (retroduodenal) third (Figs 5.29 and 5.41D) runs behind the first part of the duodenum and slopes down to the right, away from the almost vertical portal vein which now lies to the left of the duct with the gastroduodenal artery. The inferior vena cava is behind the duct. The lower (paraduodenal) third slopes further to the right in the groove between the back of the head of the pancreas and the second part of the duodenum (it may even be embedded in a tunnel of pancreatic tissue) and in front of the right renal vein. Neoplasms of the head of the pancreas may obstruct the duct here. It joins the pancreatic duct (Fig. 5.41D) at an angle of about 60° at the hepatopancreatic ampulla (of Vater). The ampulla and the ends of the two ducts are each surrounded by sphincteric muscle, the whole constituting the ampullary sphincter (of Oddi). Sometimes the muscle fibers surrounding the ampulla and the pancreatic duct are absent, leaving only the bile duct sphincter. When all three are present the arrangement allows for independent control of flow from bile and pancreatic ducts. The ampulla itself opens into the posteromedial wall of the second part of the duodenum at the major duodenal papilla, which is situated 10 cm from the pylorus.</p><p>The bile duct receives small branches from the cystic, hepatic and gastroduodenal arteries, forming anastomotic channels on the duct, especially along its right and left borders. Ligation of the cystic duct should not be carried out too near the bile duct to avoid compromising these vessels. Most of the blood to the supraduodenal part comes from below. Lower down a branch from the gastroduodenal artery which joins the posterior branch of the superior pancreaticoduodenal and which is often called the retroduodenal artery, forms a major supply. In liver transplantation the vascularity of the donor duct is a vital element for success (p. 348).</p><p>Parasympathetic fibers, mainly from the hepatic branch of the anterior vagal trunk, stimulate contraction of the gall bladder and relax the ampullary sphincter, and sympathetic fibers from cell bodies in the celiac ganglia (with preganglionic cells in the lateral horn of spinal cord segments T7-9) inhibit contraction, but the hormonal control of gall bladder activity (by CCK from enteroendocrine cells of the upper small intestine) is much more important than the neural. Afferent fibers including those subserving pain (e.g. from a duct distended by a gallstone) mostly run with right-sided sympathetic fibers and reach spinal cord segments T7-9, but some from the gall bladder may run in the right phrenic nerve (C3-5). Any afferent vagal fibers are probably concerned with reflex activities, not pain. Biliary tract pain is usually felt in the right hypochondrium and epigastrium, and may radiate round to the back in the infrascapular region, in the area of distribution of spinal nerves T7-9. The phrenic nerve supply explains the occasional referral of pain to the right shoulder region.</p><p>The fundus of the gall bladder should be easy to see after opening the abdomen (e.g. through a Kocher&rsquo;s incision below the right costal margin) but to display the rest of it and the duct system the adjacent liver, transverse colon and duodenum must be suitably retracted and the peritoneum over the cystic duct and the upper end of the free margin of the lesser omentum incised. The various ducts and vessels are dissected out and all must be positively identified, taking special care not to confuse the cystic duct with the bile duct. For cholecystectomy the cystic duct and artery are ligated and the gall bladder dissected away from the hepatic bed from the neck towards the fundus. For operative cholangiography the cannula is inserted into the cystic duct and passed down into the bile duct; the spiral valve may cause some obstruction. The upper end of the bile duct can be incised longitudinally (choledochotomy) for the removal of stones. The lower part of the duct can be exposed by mobilization of the duodenum (Kocher&rsquo;s maneuver), incising the peritoneum along the right edge of the second part of the duodenum and turning the duodenum medially so that the posterior surface of the duodenum and head of the pancreas with the duct between them can be palpated and seen. The inferior vena cava, ureter and gonadal vessels must not be damaged when peeling the duodenum forwards.</p><p>The portal vein is the upward continuation of the superior mesenteric vein, which changes its name to portal after it has received the splenic vein behind the neck of the pancreas. It lies in front of the inferior vena cava, passes upwards behind the pancreas and the first part of the duodenum and loses contact with the inferior vena cava by entering between the two layers of the lesser omentum. It runs almost vertically upwards in the free edge, where the lesser omentum forms the anterior boundary of the epiploic foramen, lying behind the bile duct and the hepatic artery (Fig. 5.38), and reaches the porta hepatis. Here it divides in a T-shaped manner into a right and left branch which enter the respective halves of the liver. Below the first part of the duodenum the bile duct and hepatic artery are curved away from it; the bile duct curves to the right behind the pancreas and the hepatic artery curves to the left in front of the pancreas to the celiac trunk.</p><p>Ligamentum teres join the left branch. The ligamentum itself (the obliterated remains of the left umbilical vein) is often not completely fibrosed even in adults (50%), and it can be cannulated at the umbilicus.</p><p>With blood coming into the portal vein mainly in two streams (superior mesenteric and splenic) it might be expected that mesenteric blood might pass mainly to the right lobe and splenic blood to the left. Although in animals the site of some liver diseases can be explained by such streaming of blood, pathological studies show that there is no significant streaming in the human liver.</p><p>The five sites of portal/systemic anastomosis are considered with the appropriate territories: lower end of the esophagus (p. 278), upper end of the anal canal (p. 403), bare area of the liver (p. 346), periumbilical region (p. 241) and retroperitoneal areas (p. 340).</p><p>In portal hypertension 80% of portal blood is shunted into the collateral channels so that only 20% reaches the liver; the opening up of the collaterals does not decrease the level of hypertension.</p><p>Below the liver right and left vitelline veins (p. 45) are joined by channels both ventral and dorsal to the duodenum (Fig. 5.39A). The splenic and superior mesenteric veins drain to the left vitelline vein, whose cranial end disappears (Fig. 5.39B), leaving the dorsal cross-channel to become the lower part of the portal vein. The upper part of the right vitelline vein and the ventral cross-channel persist as the upper part of the portal vein (Fig. 5.39B and C). The cranial ends of the vitelline veins become hepatic veins, and the uppermost part of the right vitelline vein becomes the uppermost part of the inferior vena cava.</p><p>Fig. 5.39 Development of the portal vein and the rotation of the duodenum. In A, the right and left vitelline veins, running alongside the duodenum, communicate by anastomosing cross-channels. In B, the cross-channels persist, with the dotted outlines indicating the disappearing parts of the vitelline veins. The elongating duodenum is rotating, carrying the entrance of the bile duct round to the dorsal aspect. In C, the final stage is shown, with the bile duct entering the posteromedial surface of the duodenum.</p><p>Peritoneum of the posterior abdominal wall. The transverse mesocolon is attached to its anterior surface just above the inferior border; thus most of the gland lies in the supracolic compartment (in the lesser sac, forming part of the stomach bed), but a narrow strip along its inferior border lies in the infracolic compartment. It consists of head, neck, body and tail. The head and tail incline towards the paravertebral gutters, while the neck and body are curved boldly forward over the inferior vena cava and aorta in front of the first lumbar vertebra. The gland lies somewhat obliquely, sloping from the head upwards towards the tail. The transpyloric plane (L1) is the guide to the surface marking.</p><p>The head, the broadest part of the pancreas, is molded to the C-shaped concavity of the duodenum, which it completely fills. It lies over the inferior vena cava and the right and left renal veins at the level of L2 vertebra. Its posterior surface is deeply indented, and sometimes tunneled, by the terminal part of the bile duct. The lower part of the posterior surface is prolonged, wedge-shaped to the left, behind the superior mesenteric vein and artery, in front of the aorta; this is the uncinate process of the head. The anterior surface of the head lies in both supracolic and infracolic.</p><p>The neck is best defined as the narrow band of pancreatic tissue that lies in front of the superior mesenteric and portal veins, continuous to the right with the head and to the left with the body. At the lower margin of the neck the superior mesenteric vein is embraced between the neck and the uncinate process of the head, and the splenic vein runs into the left side of the vertical superior mesenteric-portal channel. The transverse mesocolon is attached towards the lower border of the neck, which lies in the stomach bed of the lesser sac (omental bursa).</p><p>The body of the pancreas passes from the neck to the left, sloping gently upwards across the left renal vein and aorta, left crus of the diaphragm, left psoas muscle and lower pole of the left suprarenal gland, to the hilum of the left kidney. Its upper border crosses the aorta at the origin of the celiac trunk; the splenic artery passes to the left along the upper border of the body and tail, the crests of the waves showing above the pancreas, the troughs out of sight behind it (Fig. 5.29). Its lower border, alongside the neck, crosses the origin of the.</p><p>Fig. 5.40 CT scan of the upper abdomen, viewed from below. 1: Gall bladder. 2: Liver. 3: Portal vein. 4: Inferior vena cava. 5: Pancreas. 6: Spleen. 7: Left kidney. 8: T12 vertebra. 9: Abdominal aorta. 10: Right crus of diaphragm. 11: Celiac trunk.</p><p>Superior mesenteric artery. Towards the right of the anterior surface there is a slight convexity, the tuber omentale. Above the lesser curvature of the stomach this touches the tuber omentale of the left lobe of the liver, with the lesser omentum intervening. Because the pancreas usually slopes slightly upwards, its whole length is not necessarily seen in one CT scan (Fig. 5.40). The splenic vein lies closely applied to its posterior surface; the inferior mesenteric vein joins the splenic vein behind the body of the pancreas in front of the left renal vein where it lies over the left psoas muscle. The transverse mesocolon is attached towards the lower part of the anterior surface; the body lies, therefore, behind the lesser sac, where it forms part of the stomach bed.</p><p>The pancreatic duct (of Wirsung) is a continuous tube leading from the tail to the head, gradually increasing in diameter as it receives delicate tributaries. At the hepatopancreatic ampulla (p. 350 and Fig. 5.41D) it is joined at an angle of about 60° by the bile duct; in intubation of the ampulla for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), the catheter preferentially enters the pancreatic duct. It drains most of the pancreas except for the uncinate process and lower part of the head, which drains by the accessory pancreatic duct (of Santorini). For developmental reasons (see below) this opens into the duodenum at the minor duodenal papilla situated about 2 cm proximal to the major papilla. The two ducts frequently communicate with one another.</p><h2 id=blood-supply-2>Blood Supply
<a class=anchor href=#blood-supply-2>#</a></h2><p>The main vessel is the splenic artery (p. 324), which supplies the neck, body and tail. One large branch is named the arteria pancreatica magna. The head is supplied by the superior and the inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries (p. 325). Venous return is by numerous small veins into the splenic vein and, in the case of the head, by the superior pancreaticoduodenal vein into the portal vein and by the inferior pancreaticoduodenal vein into the superior mesenteric.</p><h2 id=lymph-drainage-3>Lymph Drainage
<a class=anchor href=#lymph-drainage-3>#</a></h2><p>Lymphatics from the pancreas follow the course of the arteries. To the left of the neck the pancreas drains into the retropancreatic nodes. The head drains from its upper part into the celiac group and from its lower part and uncinate process into the superior mesenteric group of preaortic lymph nodes.</p><p>Parasympathetic vagal fibers, which are capable of stimulating exocrine secretion, reach the gland mainly from the posterior vagal trunk and celiac plexus, but, as with the gall bladder, hormonal control is more important than the neural. Sympathetic vasoconstrictor impulses are derived from spinal cord segments T6-10 via splanchnic nerves and the celiac plexus, the postganglionic fibers running to the gland with its blood vessels. As with other viscera, pain fibers accompany the sympathetic supply, so that pancreatic pain may radiate in the distribution of thoracic dermatomes 6-10.</p><h2 id=structure-1>Structure
<a class=anchor href=#structure-1>#</a></h2><p>The pancreas is a lobulated gland composed of serous acini that produce the exocrine secretion, and the endocrine islets of Langerhans. The cells of the serous acini are very like those of the salivary glands, showing the cytoplasmic basophilia typical of protein-secreting cells. Under the influence of secretin and CCK produced by enteroendocrine cells of the small intestine, the pancreatic acinar cells secrete various digestive enzymes, in particular trypsin and lipase, and some (the centroacinar cells) produce bicarbonate. Ducts appear to be scanty among the acini (compare with the parotid gland, where ducts are a prominent feature); the larger ones are found in the interlobular connective tissue. The pale-staining islets are rounded groups of cells scattered among the acini; the mixture of islets and acini is the characteristic microscopic feature of the pancreas. Special staining or electron microscopy is necessary to distinguish between the α-islet cells which secrete glucagon and the ß-cells secreting insulin. There are also δ-cells that produce somatostatin.</p><p>A
Fig. 5.41 Development of liver and pancreas. A The hepatic diverticulum and ventral and dorsal pancreatic buds. B The site of the original hepatic diverticulum and ventral pancreatic bud migrates dorsally, so that in C it comes to lie below the opening of the dorsal pancreatic bud. D The pancreatic duct systems anastomose and eventually the main pancreatic duct comes to be formed from the ventral bud duct and the distal part of the dorsal bud duct, and the proximal part of the dorsal duct becomes the accessory pancreatic duct.</p><p>The pancreas develops as two separate buds, each an outgrowth of the endoderm at the junction of foregut and midgut (Fig. 5.41A). A ventral bud grows into the ventral mesogastrium in common with the outgrowth of the bile duct and a dorsal bud grows independently from a separate duct into the dorsal mesogastrium. The duodenal portion of the gut subsequently rotates (Fig. 5.39) and becomes adherent to the posterior abdominal wall. It, with the pancreatic outgrowths, finally lies behind the peritoneum. The duodenal wall grows asymmetrically; the openings of the two ducts, originally diametrically opposite, are thus carried around into line with each other (Fig. 5.41B and C), and the two parts of the gland fuse into the single adult pancreas. The duct systems of the two buds anastomose and there is eventually some interchange of drainage areas. The end result is that the duodenal end of the dorsal duct becomes the accessory pancreatic duct, and the duct of the ventral bud joins with the remainder of the dorsal duct to form the main pancreatic duct (Fig. 5.41D).</p><p>The pancreatic acini develop by growth of cells from the terminal parts of the branching ducts. The islet cells appear to have an identical origin, but become separated from their parent ducts and undergo a complete change of secretory function.</p><p>The head of the pancreas can be mobilized by Kocher&rsquo;s maneuver (p. 351). Transection of the stomach and reflection of the cut ends to each side gives greater exposure of the pancreas. Resections of the head of the pancreas with the C-shaped duodenal loop involve restoring continuity by joining the bile duct to the end of the jejunum and the stomach and pancreas to the side of it. Pseudocysts of the pancreas (fluid accumulations following pancreatitis) bulge into the lesser sac, usually behind the stomach, and can be drained intragastrically by incising the anterior wall of the stomach and then entering the cyst by incising the posterior gastric wall.</p><p>Being developed in the dorsal mesogastrium (see below), the spleen projects into the greater sac surrounded by peritoneum of the original left leaf of the dorsal mesogastrium. It lies at the left margin of the lesser sac (Fig. 5.47) below the diaphragm, and its diaphragmatic surface is molded into a reciprocal convexity. Its hilum lies in the angle between the stomach and left kidney, each of which impresses a concavity alongside the attached splenic vessels (Fig. 5.42). Its long axis lies along the line of the tenth rib, and its lower pole does not normally project any further forward than the midaxillary line. A small colic area lies in contact with the splenic flexure and the phrenicocolic ligament. Its anterior border is notched, a relic of the fusion of the several splenules from which the organ arises in the embryo (see below).</p><p>Its visceral peritoneum, or serous coat, invests all surfaces (gastric, diaphragmatic, colic and renal) and at the hilum comes into contact with the right leaf of the greater omentum. The two leaves of the greater omentum, now in contact, pass from the hilum forwards to the greater curvature of the stomach (the gastrosplenic ligament) and backwards to the front of the left kidney (the lienorenal ligament) (Fig. 5.47). The peritoneal attachment at the hilum of the spleen extends down towards the lower pole, and this attachment makes a ridge in the greater omentum. This attachment can easily be torn, accidentally, during splenectomy. The hilum of the spleen makes contact with the tail of the pancreas, which lies within the lienorenal ligament (Fig. 5.47).</p><p>Fig. 5.42 Visceral surface of the spleen, showing the impressions for adjacent viscera and the two layers of peritoneum that form the lienorenal and gastrosplenic ligaments.</p><p>Page 16. For accessory spleens, see Development (below).</p><p>The splenic artery (p. 324) passes between the layers of the lienorenal ligament and at the hilum divides in a T-shaped or Y-shaped manner. Usually further branching gives rise to four segments (perhaps only two or three); intersegmental vessels are small and scanty. Veins accompany the arteries and unite to form the splenic vein (p. 325).</p><p>Lymph drains into several nodes lying at the hilum and thence, by way of the retropancreatic nodes, to the celiac nodes.</p><p>The spleen is supplied from the celiac plexus with sympathetic fibers only.</p><p>The spleen begins to develop in the sixth week as several condensations of mesodermal cells in the dorsal mesogastrium which, because of the splenic presence, becomes divided into the lienorenal and gastrosplenic ligaments (Fig. 5.24B and p. 323). The spleen thus comes to lie at the left margin of the lesser sac. The original condensations become aggregated into a single organ; the splenic notch may represent a region where there is a lack of fusion. Accessory spleens are the result of lack of fusion; one or several may be found, usually along the splenic vessels or in the peritoneal attachments. They are commoner than is usually realized (1 in 10 individuals).</p><p>Removal of the spleen (splenectomy) essentially involves cutting its two pedicles, the lienorenal and gastrosplenic ligaments. In an emergency after rupture with hemorrhage, the left or posterior layer of the lienorenal ligament is incised and the spleen turned medially so that the splenic vessels can be dissected away from the tail of the pancreas and ligated (arteries before veins). The short gastric vessels and the gastrosplenic ligament are then divided and removal completed. For an elective procedure it is usual to enter the lesser sac by dividing the gastrosplenic ligament and its vessels and then to deal with the splenic vessels and the lienorenal ligament. The stomach must not be perforated when ligating the short gastric vessels and damage to the tail of the pancreas and splenic flexure of the colon must be avoided.</p><p>The five lumbar vertebrae project forwards into the abdominal cavity; the lumbar spine has a normal lordosis (forward convexity). The midline forward projection is enhanced by the inferior vena cava and aorta, which lie in front of the bodies of the vertebrae (Fig. 5.43A). To each side of this convexity lie deep paravertebral gutters. They are floored in by the psoas and quadratus lumborum muscles and, below the iliac crest, by the iliacus muscle. The crura and adjacent parts of the diaphragm (p. 249) are really also part of the posterior abdominal wall. The kidneys lie high up in the paravertebral gutters.</p><p>The lumbar vertebrae are separated from each other by thick intervertebral discs, which unite them very strongly. A broad ribbon, the anterior longitudinal ligament, is attached anteriorly and crosses the lumbosacral prominence to become fused with the periosteum in the hollow of the sacrum.</p><p>This muscle lies in the gutter between the bodies and transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. Its vertebral attachment is to the discs above the five lumbar vertebrae, the adjoining parts of the bodies of the vertebrae, and to fibrous arches that span the concavities of the sides of the upper four vertebral bodies. Thus there is one continuous attachment from the lower border of T12 to the upper border of L5 vertebrae. In addition, the muscle is attached to the medial ends of the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae. The muscle passes downwards along the pelvic brim (Fig. 5.43A) and then beneath the inguinal ligament into the thigh, where its tendon is attached to the lesser trochanter of the femur. The lumbar plexus (p. 362) is embedded within the muscle, and part of the external vertebral venous plexus is behind it (in front of the transverse processes). Its lateral border is straight but oblique, running downwards and somewhat laterally; its medial border is slightly curved and just overlaps the pelvic brim, so that a large pregnant uterus displaces it. The genitofemoral nerve emerges from the front of the muscle, the iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, lateral femoral cutaneous and femoral nerves from its lateral border.</p><p>Fig. 5.43 Posterior abdominal wall. A Great vessels and nerves. B Diagrammatic representation of the aorta as seen from the right side.</p><p>And the obturator nerve and the lumbosacral trunk from its medial border. The four lumbar arteries (p. 360) and veins pass beneath the four arches and run laterally behind the psoas muscle; they are accompanied by sympathetic rami (p. 364).</p><p>The strong psoas fascia (part of the iliac fascia) invests the surface of the muscle, attached to the vertebral bodies, the fibrous arches, and the transverse processes, and extends along the pelvic brim attached to the iliopubic eminence at the margins of the muscle. It retains the pus of a psoas abscess, and spinal caries may present as a cold abscess in the groin. The sheath is not part of the lumbar fascia (p. 358), but the lateral edge blends with the anterior layer of that fascia (over quadratus lumborum).</p><p>There is a thickening in the psoas fascia curving obliquely from the body of L1 (or L2) vertebra to the transverse process of L1 vertebra. This is the medial arcuate ligament, from which fibers of the diaphragm arise in continuity alongside the crus. The part of the psoas above this ligament is above the diaphragm, i.e. in the thorax. The sympathetic trunk passes from thorax to abdomen beneath this ligament.</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> By the first three lumbar nerves, mainly L2.</p><p><strong>Action.</strong> Its action on the hip joint is described on pages 153 and 168. Being attached to the sides of lumbar vertebrae it is a lateral flexor of the vertebral column. When acting from below with iliacus and their fellows of the opposite side, it assists in the flexion of the trunk produced by anterior abdominal wall muscles (especially rectus abdominis) by pulling on the lumbar part of the column as a whole (rather than by flexing one vertebra on another) while iliacus exerts its effect on the hip bone.</p><p>Psoas minor, present in only two out of every three individuals, is a slender muscle lying on the surface of psoas major. Its short slender belly arises from T12 and L1 vertebrae and its long tendon flattens out to blend with the psoas fascia behind the inguinal ligament and thus gains a bony attachment at the margin of psoas major to the arcuate line and iliopubic eminence. It is supplied by L1 nerve and its action is to flex the lumbar spine, but so weakly as to be negligible in contrast with psoas major and rectus abdominis.</p><h2 id=quadratus-lumborum>Quadratus Lumborum
<a class=anchor href=#quadratus-lumborum>#</a></h2><p>This is a flat sheet lying deep in the paravertebral gutter, edge to edge with psoas medially and transversus abdominis laterally (Fig. 5.43A). It lies in the anterior compartment of the lumbar fascia. It arises from the stout transverse process of L5 vertebra, from the strong iliolumbar ligament and from a short length of the adjoining iliac crest. Its fibers pass upwards to the transverse processes (lateral to psoas) of the upper four lumbar vertebrae and, more laterally, to the inferior border of the medial half of the twelfth rib. Its lateral border slopes upwards and medially and so crosses the lateral border of iliocostalis, which slopes upwards and laterally. Its anterior surface is covered by the anterior layer of the lumbar fascia. A thickening in front of this fascia passing from the first lumbar transverse process to the outer end of the twelfth rib constitutes the lateral arcuate ligament. The fibers of the diaphragm arise in continuity from the ligament. The subcostal neurovascular bundle (vein, artery, nerve from above downwards) emerges from the thorax beneath the ligament and slopes down across the lumbar fascia. The muscle represents the inner of the three muscular layers of the body wall and is in series with the innermost intercostal muscles (p. 242).</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> By T12 and the upper three or four lumbar nerves.</p><p><strong>Action.</strong> Its chief action is to prevent the twelfth rib from being elevated by the diaphragm, thus wasting its contraction. By depressing the twelfth rib it aids descent of the contracting diaphragm. Additionally it is an abductor (lateral flexor) of the lumbar spine.</p><h2 id=iliacus>Iliacus
<a class=anchor href=#iliacus>#</a></h2><p>This muscle arises from the hollow of the iliac fossa up to the inner lip of the iliac crest and encroaches across the sacroiliac joint to arise also from the anterior sacroiliac ligament, where it overlies the ala of the sacrum. It is triangular in shape and its fibers converge medially towards the lateral margin of psoas and pass out of the iliac fossa beneath the lateral part of the inguinal ligament. It is inserted into the psoas tendon and the adjacent part of the femur below the lesser trochanter (p. 153).</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> By the femoral nerve (L2, 3) in the iliac fossa.</p><p><strong>Action.</strong> It acts, with psoas, on the hip joint (see above and pp. 153 and 168).</p><h2 id=fascia>Fascia
<a class=anchor href=#fascia>#</a></h2><p>Each muscle of the posterior abdominal wall (quadratus lumborum, psoas and iliacus) is covered with a dense and unyielding fascia. These fasciae provide a firm fixation for the peritoneum and retroperitoneal viscera, undisturbed by the movements of contraction of the underlying muscles. The psoas fascia has been described above.</p><p><strong>Iliac fascia.</strong> The iliacus muscle is covered by the strong iliac fascia; this is attached to bone at the margins of the muscle, and to the inguinal ligament. The fascia forms a floor to the abdominal cavity, and serves for the attachment of parietal peritoneum. Apart from its prolongation into the femoral sheath (p. 154) it does not extend into the thigh, for there is no peritoneum there.</p><p><strong>Lumbar fascia.</strong> Strictly speaking, this is properly called the lumbar part of the thoracolumbar fascia. In the lumbar part of the trunk of the body, three layers of tough fibrous tissue enclose two muscular compartments (Fig. 1.10, p. 19). The anterior and middle layers occupy only the lumbar region, but the posterior layer extends above this to the lower part of the neck (as the thoracic part of the thoracolumbar fascia) and below to the dorsal surface of the sacrum. Quadratus lumborum occupies the anterior compartment, while erector spinae fills the posterior compartment. The anterior layer extends from the front of the iliolumbar ligament and adjoining iliac crest to the lower border of the twelfth rib. Medially it is attached to the front of each lumbar transverse process near its root, adjoining the attachment of the psoas fascia. Laterally it blends with the middle layer along the lateral border of quadratus lumborum; here transversus abdominis and internal oblique take origin. The middle layer extends from the back of the iliolumbar ligament and adjoining iliac crest up to the twelfth rib. Medially it is attached to the tips of the lumbar transverse processes. Laterally it blends with both anterior and posterior layers. The latter line of fusion is along the lateral border of erector spinae. Note that quadratus lumborum and erector spinae have lateral borders that slope in opposite obliquities and cross each other like the limbs of a very narrow X. The posterior layer lies over the whole erector spinae mass of muscle. It is attached medially to the spinous processes and supraspinous ligaments of all the sacral, lumbar and thoracic vertebrae. Its lateral margin traced from below upwards extends along the transverse tubercles of the sacrum to the ridge on the posterior part of the iliac crest. It slopes outwards to the twelfth rib, being attached across the lumbar region to the middle layer along the lateral border of iliocostalis. Above the twelfth rib its attachment is to the angles of all the ribs; its lateral border over the thoracic cage thus slopes up medially. In the thorax this single posterior layer constitutes the thoracic part of the thoracolumbar fascia; it is only below the thorax where there are no ribs that the thoracolumbar fascia is in three layers. The posterior layer is thick and strong over the lumbar region, being here reinforced by fusion of the aponeurotic origin of latissimus dorsi. Over the thorax it gradually becomes thinner and it fades out above the first rib over the extensor muscles of the neck, where it is replaced by the splenius muscle.</p><h2 id=vessels>Vessels
<a class=anchor href=#vessels>#</a></h2><p>The central vascular features of the posterior abdominal wall are the abdominal part of the aorta and the inferior vena cava, with the vein lying on the right side of the artery.</p><p>The thoracic aorta becomes the abdominal aorta on passing behind the median arcuate ligament and between the crura of the diaphragm, on the front of the body of T12 vertebra (Fig. 5.43A). It passes downwards on the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae, inclining.</p><p>Between the origins of the celiac trunk and the superior mesenteric artery the aorta is crossed by the splenic vein and the body of the pancreas (Fig. 5.43B). Between the superior and inferior mesenteric origins lie the left renal vein, the uncinate process of the pancreas and the third part of the duodenum. Below the duodenum the aorta is covered by the parietal peritoneum of the floor of the left infracolic compartment (Fig. 5.17).</p><p>The surface marking of the abdominal aorta is from just above the transpyloric plane in the midline to a point just to the left of the midline level with the highest points of the iliac crests. The pulsation of the aorta can usually be felt (and in thin people who are lying down, often seen) in the epigastrium or umbilical regions.</p><h2 id=branches>Branches
<a class=anchor href=#branches>#</a></h2><p>From its posterior surface at its bifurcation, the small median sacral artery is given off, to run in the midline over the sacral promontory into the hollow of the sacrum. This is morphologically the direct continuation of the aorta, vestigial in tailless man but large in creatures such as the crocodile.</p><p>The remaining branches of the abdominal aorta fall into three groups: single ventral arteries to the gut and its derivatives (celiac, superior and inferior mesenteric), paired branches to other viscera (suprarenal, renal and gonadal arteries) and paired branches to the abdominal wall (subcostal, inferior phrenic and lumbar arteries). The gut branches have already been described (p. 319 and later); the remainder are considered below and where appropriate with the viscera concerned.</p><p>The suprarenal arteries arise from the aorta between its inferior phrenic and renal branches. They run laterally across the crus of the diaphragm; the right artery lies between the crus and the inferior vena cava and behind the bare area of the liver, and the left one is behind the posterior wall of the lesser sac, in the stomach bed. Each artery divides into several small branches before entering the gland (p. 372).</p><p>The renal arteries are large vessels arising at right angles from the aorta at the level of L2 vertebra (Fig. 5.43). The left artery is shorter than the right; it crosses the left crus and psoas, behind and somewhat above the left renal vein, both of which are covered by the tail of the pancreas and the splenic vessels. The longer right artery crosses the right crus and psoas behind the inferior vena cava and the short right renal vein; these structures separate the artery from the head of the pancreas and bile duct and from the second part of the duodenum. Each artery approaches the hilum of the kidney to supply the renal segments, as described on page 368 (Fig. 5.49).</p><p>Each renal artery gives off small suprarenal and ureteric branches (pp. 372 and 371).</p><p>The gonadal arteries have a similar origin and course in both sexes. The testicular or ovarian arteries arise from near the front of the aorta, below the renal arteries but well above the origin of the inferior mesenteric. They slope steeply downwards over psoas (the right artery first crossing the inferior vena cava), crossing the ureter and supplying its middle portion, and being themselves crossed by the colic vessels and the peritoneum of the floor of the infracolic compartment (Fig. 5.43A). They reach the pelvic brim about halfway between the sacroiliac joint and the inguinal ligament, after which their course is different in the two sexes. The testicular artery runs along the pelvic brim above the external iliac artery, enters the deep inguinal ring and passes in the spermatic cord to the testis (Fig. 5.12 and p. 306). The ovarian artery crosses the pelvic brim and enters the suspensory ligament to pass to the ovary and uterine tube (Fig. 5.59 and p. 391).</p><p>The subcostal arteries are strictly not branches of the abdominal aorta, having arisen from the lowest part of the thoracic aorta (p. 247), but are mentioned here because each enters the abdomen beneath the lateral arcuate ligament. It runs between the subcostal nerve and vein on the anterior surface of the lumbar fascia over quadratus lumborum behind the kidney, and passes laterally into the neurovascular plane of the anterior abdominal wall (between internal oblique and transversus).</p><p>The inferior phrenic arteries leave the aorta at the aortic opening and each slopes upwards over the crus of the diaphragm, which they supply. They give off small suprarenal branches (p. 372).</p><p>The lumbar arteries, four in number, leave the abdominal aorta opposite the bodies of the upper four vertebrae. Hugging the bone they pass beneath the lumbar sympathetic trunks and the fibrous arches in the psoas. On the right side the inferior vena cava overlies the lumbar arteries. Each artery gives off posterior and spinal branches and passes laterally through the psoas muscle. The three upper arteries pass laterally behind quadratus lumborum muscle into the neurovascular plane between transversus abdominis and internal oblique. The fourth lumbar artery, like the subcostal, passes across to the neurovascular plane in front of the lower border of quadratus lumborum, along the upper margin of the iliolumbar ligament. There is no fifth lumbar artery; its place is taken by the iliolumbar artery (from the internal iliac, p. 395). It ascends from the pelvis in front of the lumbosacral trunk and passes laterally behind the obturator nerve and psoas muscle. The lumbar branch supplies psoas and quadratus lumborum and gives a spinal branch which enters the L5-S1 intervertebral foramen. The iliac branch runs into the iliac fossa, supplying iliacus and the ilium, and ends in the anastomosis at the anterior superior iliac spine.</p><p>The common iliac arteries are formed by the bifurcation of the aorta, on the body of L4 vertebra but to the left of the midline, so that the right artery is a centimeter longer than the left. Each passes to the front of the sacroiliac joint where the bifurcation into external and internal iliac arteries occurs; the ureter lies in front of this bifurcation or the very beginning of the external iliac. The left common iliac is crossed by the inferior mesenteric (superior rectal) vessels. Each is also crossed by the sympathetic contributions to the superior hypogastric plexus (p. 365) and covered by the parietal peritoneum of the posterior abdominal wall.</p><p>The external iliac artery continues in the line of the common iliac, along the pelvic brim on psoas, and passes beneath the inguinal ligament to enter the femoral sheath as the femoral artery. Its two branches are given off just above the ligament. The inferior epigastric artery (p. 300) is a key feature at the deep inguinal ring (p. 304) and supplies the rectus muscle (p. 300). The deep circumflex iliac artery runs above the inguinal ligament (p. 300; Fig. 5.10).</p><p>The surface marking of the common and external iliac arteries is from the aortic bifurcation (just to the left of the midline level with the highest points of the iliac crests) along a line slightly concave laterally to the midpoint between the anterior superior iliac spine and the pubic symphysis. The bifurcation of the common into the external and internal iliacs is 3 cm from the midline level with the tubercles of the iliac crests.</p><p>The internal iliac arteries enter the pelvis and are described on page 394.</p><p>The inferior vena cava has a longer course than the aorta in the abdomen. It begins opposite L5 vertebra, lower than the bifurcation of the aorta, by the confluence of the two common iliac veins behind the right common iliac artery (Fig. 5.43A). It runs upwards on the right of the aorta beyond the aortic opening in the diaphragm, above which level it lies on the right crus behind the bare area of the liver, and extends to the central tendon of the diaphragm, which it pierces on a level with the body of T8 vertebra (four vertebrae higher than the beginning of the abdominal aorta). It lies on the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae, overlapping the right sympathetic trunk, and crosses the right renal artery.</p><p>Due to its complex embryological origin, the vena caval tributaries are not identical with the branches of the abdominal aorta. In particular there is none corresponding to the three ventral branches to the gut. The blood from the alimentary tract, pancreas and spleen is collected by the portal venous system, and only after passing through the liver does it reach the vena cava via the hepatic veins (p. 346), the vena cava&rsquo;s highest tributaries. Above its formation by the union of the two common iliac veins, the other tributaries (in ascending order) are the fourth and third lumbar veins of both sides, right gonadal vein, both renal veins, right lumbar azygos vein, right suprarenal vein and both inferior phrenics.</p><p>Each common iliac vein is formed in front of the sacroiliac joint by the union of the internal iliac vein from the pelvis (p. 397) and the external iliac vein, the continuation of the femoral vein, which enters the abdomen on the medial side of its corresponding artery and runs along the pelvic brim behind the artery. The two common iliac veins continue upwards behind their arteries to unite to form the vena cava behind the right common iliac artery (Fig. 5.43A). Because the vena cava is to the right of the midline, the left common iliac vein is longer than the right. It joins its fellow almost at a right angle after bulging forwards across the body of L5 vertebra, and is often compressed by the overlying artery. Each common iliac vein receives iliolumbar and perhaps lateral sacral veins, while the left usually receives the median sacral vein which lies on the right of the corresponding artery.</p><p>And drain the lateral and posterior abdominal walls, with anastomotic connections anteriorly with the epigastric veins and posteriorly with the vertebral venous plexuses. The fourth and third empty into the vena cava; those from the left pass behind the aorta, and all are expected to lie behind the sympathetic trunks but occasionally one or more may be in front. The second and first do not usually reach the vena cava but join the ascending lumbar vein, which unites common iliac and iliolumbar veins and passes vertically upwards behind psoas and in front of the lumbar transverse processes; that on the right passes through the aortic opening and that on the left perforates the left crus. Each joins the subcostal vein to form the azygos and hemiazygos veins respectively; the lumbar azygos vein (see below) may also run into this junction and have connections with the first and/or second lumbars.</p><p>The gonadal veins accompany the arteries (testicular or ovarian) and each is usually paired. As they run up on psoas the two venae comitantes unite. On the right the vein is usually said to enter the vena cava just below the renal vein, but the right testicular vein may join the renal vein (p. 306); on the left it invariably joins the left renal vein.</p><p>The renal veins lie in front of the renal arteries and behind the pancreas, and join the vena cava at right angles, at the level of L2 vertebra. Each emerges from the hilum of the kidney as five or six tributaries which soon unite. In length and in territory drained the two veins are very different. The left renal vein is three times as long as the right (7.5 cm compared with 2.5 cm, 3 in or 1 in), having to cross in front of the aorta. It receives the left suprarenal vein and left gonadal vein, possibly the left inferior phrenic vein, and is connected with the left ascending lumbar and lumbar azygos veins and hence with the azygos and vertebral systems. In contrast the shorter right renal vein drains only its own kidney (unless the right testicular vein also enters it - p. 306).</p><p>The right lumbar azygos vein is a very small vessel, frequently obliterated, connecting the posterior surface of the vena cava at renal vein level with the azygos vein. It lies behind psoas, medial to the ascending lumbar vein. (If present the left lumbar azygos vein connects the back of the left renal vein to the hemiazygos vein.)</p><p>The right suprarenal vein is a very short but stout vessel that enters the vena cava behind the bare area of the liver, where the gland lies in contact with both liver and vena cava (p. 372).</p><p>The inferior phrenic veins accompany the arteries on the lower surface of the diaphragm and normally join the vena cava just below the liver, but the left vessel may join the left renal or suprarenal vein, or even be double with different destinations.</p><p>The three main hepatic veins (right, central and left) and several accessory hepatic veins enter the vena cava as it lies in its groove on the back of the liver (p. 346). The hepatic veins have no extrahepatic course, being completely engulfed in liver substance (and hence easily forgotten when trying to recall the vena caval tributaries!).</p><h2 id=lymph-nodes-and-lymph-trunks>Lymph Nodes and Lymph Trunks
<a class=anchor href=#lymph-nodes-and-lymph-trunks>#</a></h2><p>From nodes which drain the alimentary tract, liver, gall bladder and biliary tract, spleen and pancreas (p. 328), lymphatics pass back along the celiac, superior and inferior mesenteric arteries to preaortic nodes situated around the origins of these three vessels. Similarly, lymphatics pass back along the paired branches of the aorta, both visceral and somatic, to para-aortic nodes which lie alongside the aorta at the origins of the paired vessels. The lymph drainage of any viscus follows its artery back to the aorta. Lymph from pelvic viscera drains through nodes along the internal iliac vessels. The lower limb drains by deep inguinal nodes through the femoral canal into nodes along the external iliac vessels. Both these iliac groups drain up to the para-aortic nodes.</p><p>From the highest of these aortic groups, a variable number of intestinal and lumbar lymph trunks (and smaller lymphatics from the posterior ends of the lower intercostal spaces) join to form the elongated, sac-like cisterna chyli (though frequently the single cisterna is replaced by a confluence or rete of trunks). It is situated under cover of the right crus, in front of the bodies of L1 and L2 vertebrae, between the aorta and azygos vein. Its upper end becomes continuous with the thoracic duct (p. 279).</p><p>Some of the fat absorbed by intestinal cells enters blood capillaries and so reaches the liver directly by the portal vein, but other processed lipid molecules enter the lacteals of the intestinal villi as chylomicrons, so producing the milky-looking lymph which enters the bloodstream via the cisterna chyli and thoracic duct.</p><p>The lumbar spinal nerves at their emergence from the intervertebral foramina necessarily pass into the substance of psoas major. They give segmental branches of supply to psoas and quadratus lumborum and then unite to form the lumbar plexus within the substance of psoas (p. 356).</p><p>The segmental outflow from the spinal cord continues in series with the intercostal nerves of the thoracic wall. T12 (the subcostal nerve) and all five lumbar nerves emerge in series from the intervertebral foramina, but they do not all share in the supply of the anterior abdominal wall. Only T12 and L1 do so, in fact. L2, 3 and 4, after each giving a branch to the muscles of the posterior abdominal wall (psoas and quadratus lumborum) break up into anterior and posterior divisions which reunite to form nerves for the flexor and extensor compartments of the thigh. Thus is formed the lumbar plexus. The nerves to the thigh are the obturator (for the adductor compartment, a derivative of the flexor compartment of the thigh) and the femoral and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves (extensor compartment). The remainder of L4 and all L5 pass down as the lumbosacral trunk to the sacral plexus for distribution to the lower limb (p. 397).</p><p>The lumbar plexus, formed from the anterior rami of the upper four lumbar nerves, lies within the substance of psoas major, and its branches emerge therefrom. Most of the branches are for the supply of the lower limb, but in their passage across the posterior abdominal wall they give sensory branches to the parietal peritoneum.</p><p>Nerves for the supply of the anterior abdominal wall cross the anterior surface of quadratus lumborum. They are the subcostal and the iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves (Fig. 5.43A).</p><p>The subcostal nerve (T12) passes from the thorax behind the lateral arcuate ligament, where it lies below the vein and artery. The whole neurovascular bundle slopes down (parallel with the twelfth rib) across the front of the anterior layer of the lumbar fascia, bound to it by the cellular tissue of the extraperitoneal fascial envelope; here it lies behind the kidney. The subcostal is a large nerve, which disappears by passing through transversus abdominis to reach the neurovascular plane. It slopes down around the anterior abdominal wall, whose muscles it supplies, and ends by supplying the lower part of rectus abdominis and the pyramidalis muscle and the skin above them. Like intercostal nerves it has a collateral (muscular) branch, and its lateral cutaneous branch pierces the oblique muscles and descends over the iliac crest to supply the skin of the anterior part of the buttock between the iliac crest and the greater trochanter.</p><p>The iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves lie in front of quadratus lumborum at a lower level. They both arise from the anterior ramus of L1. The ilioinguinal nerve represents the collateral branch of the iliohypogastric and consequently has no lateral cutaneous branch (unlike intercostal nerves). The nerves divide from a common stem. The point of division may be in the psoas muscle or lateral to it, in front of quadratus lumborum. In either case the nerves emerge from the lateral border of psoas major behind the anterior layer of the lumbar fascia. As they slope across the quadratus lumborum, behind the kidney, they pierce the fascia and pass laterally in front of it to sink into transversus abdominis and run downwards and forwards, above the iliac crest, in the neurovascular plane.</p><p>The iliohypogastric nerve gives a lateral cutaneous branch which sinks below the iliac crest to supply skin of the upper part of the buttock behind the area supplied by the subcostal nerve. The nerve then slopes downwards in the neurovascular plane and pierces the internal oblique above the anterior superior iliac spine. Sloping down between external and internal obliques it pierces the aponeurosis of the external oblique about 2.5 cm (1 in) above the superficial inguinal ring and ends by supplying the skin over the lower part of rectus abdominis and the mons pubis.</p><p>The ilioinguinal nerve represents the collateral branch of the iliohypogastric nerve. It runs parallel with the iliohypogastric at a lower level. Piercing the lower border of internal oblique (Fig. 5.9), it runs downwards and medially and so enters the inguinal canal from the side, continuing behind the external oblique aponeurosis. At the superficial inguinal ring it is covered by the external spermatic fascia which it pierces to become subcutaneous. It supplies the anterior one-third of the scrotum (labium majus), the root of the penis (clitoris), and the upper and medial part of the groin, down to the anterior axial line. Before it perforates the lower border of the internal oblique muscle it gives motor branches to those muscle fibers of internal oblique and transversus which are inserted into the free edge of the conjoint tendon. For the importance of this nerve supply in relation to inguinal hernia, see page 304.</p><p>The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is formed by union of fibers from the posterior divisions of the anterior rami of L2 and L3. It usually emerges from the lateral border of psoas major below the iliolumbar ligament, passing around the iliac fossa on the surface of the iliacus muscle deep to the iliac fascia. For 3 cm or more (over 1 in) above the inguinal ligament it slopes forward and lies imprisoned in the fibrous tissue of the iliac fascia (Fig. 3.1, p. 147). Fibers of transversus abdominis commonly arise from this fascia, and their contraction may pull on the nerve (meralgia paresthetica, p. 146). The nerve passes below or perforates the inguinal ligament a centimeter from the anterior superior iliac spine and so enters the thigh. The nerve may arise, not as stated above, but as a branch from the femoral nerve where the latter lies in the iliac fossa in the gutter between psoas and iliacus. This is not surprising, since the femoral and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves are derived from the same source (posterior divisions of the anterior rami of L2, 3, 4 and L2, 3 respectively). The nerve supplies the parietal peritoneum of the iliac fossa. Its peripheral distribution is considered on page 146.</p><p>The femoral nerve is formed in the substance of psoas major by union of branches from the posterior divisions of the anterior rami of L2, 3, 4 (the obturator nerve is formed from the anterior divisions of the same nerves). It emerges from the lateral border of psoas in the iliac fossa and runs down deep in the gutter between psoas and iliacus behind the iliac fascia. It gives two or three branches to iliacus (L2 and 3) and leaves the iliac fossa by passing beneath the inguinal ligament to the lateral side of the femoral sheath, on the iliacus muscle (Fig. 5.43A). Its course in the thigh is considered on page 156.</p><p>The foregoing nerves emerge from the lateral margin of psoas. The genitofemoral and obturator nerves have each a different pathway.</p><p>The genitofemoral nerve is formed in the substance of psoas major by union of branches from L1 and 2. It emerges from the anterior surface of psoas major (and of psoas minor if present) and runs down on the muscle deep to the psoas fascia. In front of the fascia the left nerve is overlaid by the ureter, gonadal vessels, left inferior colic arteries and the inferior mesenteric vein and the peritoneum of the floor of the left infracolic compartment. The right nerve is overlaid by the ureter, gonadal vessels and the ileocolic artery and the mesentery in the right infracolic compartment. Just above the inguinal ligament it perforates the psoas fascia and divides into genital and femoral branches (Fig. 3.1, p. 147). The genital branch is composed of L2 and the femoral branch of L1 fibers.</p><p>The genital branch passes through the transversalis fascia and enters the coverings of the spermatic cord (p. 305). It supplies motor fibers to the cremaster muscle, and sensory fibers to the spermatic fasciae, and the tunica vaginalis of the testis. The femoral branch passes down in front of the femoral artery, pierces the femoral sheath and the fascia lata, and supplies the skin of the groin below the middle part of the inguinal ligament.</p><p>The obturator nerve and the lumbosacral trunk emerge from the medial border of psoas to enter the pelvis (p. 397).</p><p>The abdomen receives both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. The sympathetic supply is twofold, by the lumbar part of the sympathetic trunk and by the celiac plexus which receives fibers from the thoracic part of the trunk. The celiac plexus is wholly visceral; it supplies all the abdominal organs, including the gonads. The ganglionated lumbar trunk supplies somatic branches for the lower abdominal wall and the lower limb, but its visceral branches supply only the pelvic organs. The parasympathetic supply is provided by the vagus from above and the pelvic splanchnic nerves from below; it is wholly visceral. The vagus joins the celiac plexus and the pelvic splanchnics join the inferior hypogastric plexus. Thus it is better to study the sympathetic plexuses first.</p><p>The lumbar part of the sympathetic trunk brings preganglionic fibers descending from the lower thoracic trunk, and it receives a further input of preganglionic fibers (white rami) from the first and second lumbar nerves. Its ganglia give off the regular somatic and visceral branches (p. 30), and the trunk passes down across the pelvic brim to become the sacral part of the trunk (p. 398).</p><p>The lumbar part of the sympathetic trunk enters the abdomen by passing behind the medial arcuate ligament on the front of psoas major. Passing in front of the psoas fascia the trunk lies on the vertebral bodies just touching the medial margin of the psoas muscle. As elsewhere it lies in front of the segmental vessels.</p><p>The lumbar ganglia are conventionally four in number, but fusion of ganglia may reduce them. White rami communicantes are received from the first two lumbar nerves and small accessory ganglia lie at this level within the substance of psoas (Fig. 5.44). Here relay occurs and the grey rami return to the first two (especially the first) lumbar nerves within the substance of the muscle. The other white rami (for the sympathetic trunk itself) pass from the upper two lumbar nerves behind the fibrous arches in psoas. They join the trunk and run down to relay in the lumbar and sacral ganglia, for the somatic and visceral branches therefrom.</p><p>Fig. 5.44 Sympathetic rami at L1 or L2 vertebral levels. An accessory ganglion in psoas major relays directly back to the segmental nerve; the remainder of L1 and L2 outflow passes into the sympathetic trunk for local or distant relay.</p><p>Somatic branches (grey rami communicantes) pass from the lumbar ganglia to all five lumbar nerves, for distribution to the body wall and lower limb. They accompany the lumbar vessels behind the fibrous arches in psoas. Those for L1 and 2 are very sparse, since almost all the relay at these levels takes place in the accessory ganglia in psoas.</p><p>Visceral branches (lumbar splanchnic nerves) arise from all lumbar ganglia to join the celiac, aortic and superior hypogastric plexuses. Those from the third and fourth ganglia pass respectively in front of and behind the common iliac arteries, so forming loops under those vessels. They join with each other and with fibers from the aortic plexus in front of L5 vertebra to form the superior hypogastric plexus. This was previously known as the presacral nerve but was a misnomer: it is prelumbar, not presacral, and is not a single nerve but a plexus. The plexus breaks up into the right and left hypogastric nerves (which again may not be single but a bundle) which run down into the pelvis to join the inferior hypogastric plexus (p. 399). There are a few ganglion cells in the superior hypogastric plexus. The preganglionic white fibers in the hypogastric nerves pass through to relay in ganglia in the inferior hypogastric plexuses which supply pelvic viscera. They give no branches to the abdominal viscera, which are supplied by the celiac plexus.</p><p>The celiac plexus lies around the origin of the celiac trunk above the upper border of the pancreas. The greater and lesser splanchnic nerves pierce the crura of the diaphragm and enter the celiac ganglia. These are two semilunar masses, right and left, which overlap the edges of the aorta and encroach laterally on the crura of the diaphragm. Either or both ganglia may be separated into two or more ganglionic masses. The splanchnic nerves are almost all preganglionic (white) and they relay in the celiac ganglia. The least splanchnic nerve relays in a small renal ganglion behind the renal artery. This is merely an offshoot of the main celiac ganglion itself. Separated masses of ganglion may lie on the aorta at the superior and even the inferior mesenteric artery origins. Such irregularity, of separation or of fusion, is common in autonomic ganglia.</p><p>From the celiac ganglia the mass of postganglionic fibers build up a rich network on the aorta, the celiac plexus (Fig. 5.45). The fibers supply all the abdominal viscera, which they reach by streaming along the visceral branches of the aorta. Thus the midline gut arteries (celiac, and superior and inferior mesenteric) carry sympathetic fibers to the foregut and its derivatives, to the midgut, and to the hindgut down to the lower rectum. Similarly the paired visceral arteries carry fibers from the celiac plexus. Those passing to the kidney pick up the branches of the renal ganglion to form the renal plexus behind the renal artery. Testis.</p><p>Fig. 5.45 Constituents of the celiac plexus. The plexus lies distal to the sympathetic relays in the celiac ganglia. Preganglionic fibers (myelinated) are shown in heavy line, postganglionic (unmyelinated) in slender line.</p><p>And ovary are likewise supplied by a sympathetic plexus that accompanies each gonadal artery. Some postganglionic fibers are not used up at the inferior mesenteric artery, in which case they stream down over the aorta to enter the superior hypogastric plexus.</p><p>The suprarenal gland has a second supply. Preganglionic fibers from the lesser (or greater) splanchnic nerve pass without relay to the cells of the suprarenal medulla (these cells share a common origin from neural crest ectoderm with the cell bodies of sympathetic ganglia). These preganglionic fibers cause the suprarenal medulla to pour forth adrenalin. The vasomotor supply to the suprarenal gland reaches it by postganglionic fibers from regular relay in the celiac ganglion.</p><p>For removal of the third and fourth lumbar ganglia (p. 33), the approach is through a transverse muscle-cutting incision in the anterior abdominal wall on the appropriate side. The intact peritoneum is stripped off right round to the vertebral column, carefully avoiding damage to the gonadal vessels, ureter and genitofemoral nerve overlying psoas major. The right sympathetic trunk is under cover of the inferior vena cava, which must be gently displaced without tearing lumbar vessels (p. 361); some lumbar vessels may pass in front of the trunks. On the left the trunk is parallel with the margin of the aorta. The third and fourth ganglia and the intervening part of the trunk are removed.</p><h2 id=parasympathetic-nerves>Parasympathetic Nerves
<a class=anchor href=#parasympathetic-nerves>#</a></h2><p>Both vagi, intermixed in the vagal trunks (p. 334), contribute fibers to the celiac plexus. Without relay they accompany the postganglionic sympathetic fibers of the plexus, but not to the whole territory. To the gut they pass along the foregut and midgut arteries only as far as the transverse colon - no mean feat, however, for a cranial nerve! They enter the renal plexus and pass into the kidney, for a purpose which is obscure. They do not supply the gonads or suprarenals, as far as is known.</p><p>The pelvic splanchnic nerves, from cell bodies in the lateral horn of sacral segments 2 to 3 or 4 (p. 33), arise from the anterior rami of those sacral nerves distal to the anterior sacral foramina. They anastomose with one another and join the inferior hypogastric plexus for distribution to pelvic viscera. On the left some fibers rise up out of the pelvis, usually passing to the left of the superior hypogastric plexus, to join the inferior mesenteric artery (or make their own way behind the peritoneum) to supply the large intestine from the splenic flexure downwards.</p><p>The vagus is motor and secretomotor to the gut and its glands down to the transverse colon; the pelvic splanchnics fulfill this function from the splenic flexure to the rectum.</p><p>The kidneys lie high up on the posterior abdominal wall (Fig. 5.29) behind the peritoneum, largely under cover of the costal margin. At best only their lower poles can be palpated in the normal individual. Each kidney lies obliquely, with its long axis parallel with the lateral border of psoas major. On its vascular pedicle it lies well back in the paravertebral gutter, so that the hilum, a vertical slit-like depression at the medial border transmitting the renal vessels and nerves and the renal pelvis (the beginning of the ureter), faces somewhat forwards as well as medially (Fig. 5.48). As a result of this slight rotation of the kidney an anteroposterior radiograph gives a somewhat foreshortened picture of the width of the kidney. The normal kidney measures about 12 x 6 x 3 cm (4 x 2 x 1 in) and weighs about 130 g (4 oz). The hilum of the right kidney lies just below, and of the left just above, the transpyloric plane 5 cm (2 in) from the midline; these are the surface markings of the hila. The bulk of the right lobe of the liver accounts for the lower position of the right kidney. The upper pole of the left kidney may overlie the eleventh rib in a radiograph, that of the right kidney seldom ascends so high, though it must be remembered that each kidney moves in a vertical range of 2 cm (about 1 in) during full respiratory excursion of the diaphragm.</p><p>The kidney possesses a capsule which gives the fresh organ a glistening appearance. All surfaces are usually smooth and convex though traces of lobulation, normal in the fetus, are often seen. Thick rounded lips of kidney substance bound the hilum, from which the pelvis emerges behind the vessels to pass down into the ureter.</p><p>Posteriorly the relations of both kidneys are similar, comprising mostly the diaphragm and quadratus lumborum muscles, with overlap medially on to psoas and laterally on to transversus abdominis. The upper pole lies on those fibers of the diaphragm which arise from the lateral and medial arcuate ligaments. Thus the costodiaphragmatic recess of the pleura lies posteriorly; it is the most important of all posterior relations (Fig. 5.46), and is at risk in the lumbar approach (p. 311). The subcostal vein, artery and nerve, on emerging beneath the lateral arcuate ligament, lie behind the posterior surface of the kidney, as do the iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves as they emerge from the lateral border of psoas. (The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is normally too low to be a posterior relation.) The upper lumbar arteries and veins lie behind the quadratus lumborum and thus are more distant from the kidney.</p><p>The hilum of the kidney lies over psoas and the convexity of the lateral border lies on the aponeurosis of origin of transversus abdominis. The suprarenal glands lie somewhat asymmetrical (Fig. 5.29). The right gland, pyramidal in shape, surmounts the upper pole of the right kidney, behind the inferior vena cava and the bare area of the liver, while the left gland, crescentic in shape, is applied to the medial border of the left kidney above its hilum, behind the peritoneum of the posterior wall of the lesser sac.</p><p>Fig. 5.46 Relationship of the pleural sacs to the upper poles of the kidneys, from behind. The ureters lie medial to the tips of the lumbar transverse processes.</p><p>Solid consistency than the general body fat. It is in the shape of an inverted cone, filling the funnel-shaped hollow of the suprailiac part of the paravertebral gutter, and it plays a part in retaining the kidney in position. The development of nephroptosis (floating kidney) after severe loss of weight is thus explained.</p><p>The renal fascia surrounds the perinephric fat and separates the kidney from the suprarenal gland. It is no very obvious membrane in the living, but appears more convincingly in the coagulated dissecting-room cadaver. In truth it is little more than a vague condensation of the areolar tissue between the parietal peritoneum and the posterior abdominal wall, but certain of its attachments are worthy of note, since they serve to restrain the extension of a perinephric abscess. At the hilum of the kidney the fascia is firmly attached to the renal vessels and the ureter, a further factor in stabilizing the kidney and in discouraging spread of pus across the midline. It ascends as a dome between the upper pole of the kidney and the suprarenal, and explains why, in nephrectomy, the latter gland is not usually displaced (or even seen). It is sometimes.</p><p>Fig. 5.47 Diagrammatic transverse section through the left upper abdomen, viewed from below (like a CT scan), showing the peritoneal relationships of the spleen and renal fascia. The short gastric vessels run in the gastrosplenic ligament. The splenic vessels and the tail of the pancreas are in the lienorenal ligament. The kidney is surrounded by its own capsule, the perirenal fat and the renal fascia.</p><p>The renal pelvis is the funnel-shaped commencement of the ureter, and is normally the most posterior of the three main structures in the hilum (though occasionally an arterial branch or venous tributary may lie behind it). Its upper and lower extremities receive two or three major calyces (p. 369). The pelvis, like the ureter, is lined by transitional epithelium and there is smooth muscle as well as connective tissue in its wall. Recent studies suggest that specialized muscle cells in the walls of the minor calyces act as pacemakers that initiate contractile waves which pass down into the ureter. The capacity of the average pelvis is less than 5 ml. Note that its proper name is the renal pelvis, not the pelvis of the ureter.</p><h2 id=blood-supply-and-segments>Blood Supply and Segments
<a class=anchor href=#blood-supply-and-segments>#</a></h2><p>The wide-bored renal arteries (p. 359) have a blood flow in excess of 1 liter per minute. They leave the abdominal aorta at right angles and lie behind the pancreas and renal veins.</p><p>A

Fig. 5.48 CT scans of the upper abdomen (viewed by convention from below). In A, the left renal vein crosses in front of the aorta to enter the inferior vena cava. In B, the pelvis of the right kidney is indicated by the white opacity (representing oral contrast medium which has been absorbed and excreted by the kidney), while on the left side the ureter, similarly outlined, lies immediately medial to the lower pole of the kidney.</p><p>Based on its blood supply, each kidney possesses five segments. In the region of the hilum the artery typically gives rise to an anterior and a posterior division (Fig. 5.49A). The posterior division supplies the posterior segment, while the anterior division gives branches that supply the apical, upper, middle and lower segments (Fig. 5.49B, C and D). The standard pattern is frequently modified by the way the vessels branch, e.g. the vessels to more than one segment may arise from a common stem and several variations are possible but there are always five segments with no collateral circulation between them. Abnormal or aberrant renal arteries, such as a vessel running from the aorta to the lower pole are, in fact, segmental vessels with an unusual origin (persistence of a fetal vessel, p. 370). They are not usually accompanied by veins.</p><p>Veins from the renal segments communicate with one another profusely (unlike the arteries) and eventually form five or six vessels that unite at the hilum to form the single renal vein (p. 361). The usual order of structures in the hilum of each kidney is vein, artery, ureter from front to back.</p><h2 id=lymph-drainage-4>Lymph Drainage
<a class=anchor href=#lymph-drainage-4>#</a></h2><p>The lymphatics of the kidney drain to para-aortic nodes at the level of origin of the renal arteries (L2). The surface of the upper pole may drain through the diaphragm into nodes in the posterior mediastinum.</p><p>Renal nerves are derived from both parts of the autonomic system. The sympathetic preganglionic cells lie in the spinal cord from T12 to L1 segments and they send preganglionic fibers to the thoracic and lumbar splanchnic nerves. The postganglionic cells are in the celiac, renal and superior hypogastric plexuses and, for the least splanchnic nerve, in the renal ganglion in the hilum of the kidney. They are vasomotor in function. Afferent fibers, including those subserving pain, accompany the sympathetic nerves as for most other viscera. Thus the pathway for the pain of renal colic from a stone in the calyces or renal pelvis may run along blood vessels to the celiac plexus and thence by the splanchnic nerves to the sympathetic trunk and via white rami communicantes to T12-L1 spinal nerves and so into the spinal cord by the posterior nerve roots. The pain may radiate from the back and lumbar region to the anterior abdominal wall and down to the external genitalia. There is some parasympathetic supply from the vagus, of uncertain function, but it is possible that some afferents run with the vagal fibers, and this may explain the nausea and vomiting that may accompany renal pain.</p><h2 id=structure-2>Structure
<a class=anchor href=#structure-2>#</a></h2><p>The internal structure of the kidney is displayed when the organ is split open longitudinally. A dark reddish cortex lies beneath the capsule and extends towards the pelvis as the renal columns, lying between a number of darker and triangular striated areas, the pyramids of the medulla. The apices of several pyramids open together into a renal papilla, each of which projects into a minor calyx. The minor calyces unite to form two or three major calyces which open into the renal pelvis.</p><p>The histological and functional unit of the kidney is the nephron, and there are about 1 million in each kidney. Each nephron consists of a glomerulus and a tubule system. The glomerulus is a tuft of capillaries surrounded by very thin epithelial cells (podocytes), the whole forming a mass which projects into a rounded capsule (of Bowman). The epithelium covering the capillaries is continuous with that forming the boundary of Bowman&rsquo;s capsule, which in turn continues into the epithelium of the tubule system. The part of the tubule adjacent to Bowman&rsquo;s capsule is the proximal convoluted tubule, and this leads into the thin-walled loop of Henle and so to the distal convoluted tubule and finally to the collecting tubule and collecting duct. The glomeruli and convoluted tubules are in the cortex, and the loops of Henle and collecting tubules and ducts in the medulla. The collecting ducts unite with one another, and the largest open at the tip of a renal papilla in a minor calyx. The glomerular capillaries are supplied by an afferent arteriole, and leaving them is an efferent arteriole which breaks up into peritubular capillaries surrounding the proximal and distal convoluted tubules. Urine is a glomerular filtrate (deproteinized plasma) which passes into the space of Bowman&rsquo;s capsule and so into the tubule system where it is modified by selective absorption and secretion. Certain arteriolar cells and distal convoluted tubule cells constitute the juxtaglomerular (JG) apparatus. Arteriolar JG cells of the tunica media secrete renin.</p><p>Three separate excretory organs appear in vertebrate evolution - the pronephros, mesonephros and metanephros (p. 36). The first two consist of excretory tubules arranged segmentally and they empty into the same (mesonephric) duct. The third consists of a mass of tubules having no segmental arrangement and it drains into a new duct that develops specifically for the purpose (the ureter).</p><p>The pronephros (only prominent in embryo fishes) is very evanescent, but its duct persists. Mesonephric tubules (which form the excretory organ in fishes and amphibia) then develop and open into the pronephric duct which is henceforth called the mesonephric (Wolffian) duct (p. 309). Caudal to the mesonephros the intermediate cell mass gives rise to about a million new tubules, forming the metanephros. The latter induces a bud, the ureter, to grow from the caudal end of the mesonephric duct. The ureteric bud separates from the mesonephric duct, leaving the latter to form part of the bladder (p. 383) and in the male the ductus deferens and associated structures (p. 309). The bud grows up and divides into the calyces of the pelvis (major and minor) and the collecting tubules of the medullary pyramids, into which the distal convoluted tubules of the metanephros come to drain. The fetal and neonatal kidney has a lobulated appearance, reflecting the way metanephric tissue overlies tubular budding from the calyces.</p><p>The definitive kidney (metanephros) develops in the pelvis and is supplied from the internal iliac artery. It subsequently migrates to its adult position, gaining successively new arteries of supply from the common iliac and then from the aorta. The older vessels degenerate as the new ones appear, until the (usually) single definitive artery forms. The hilum is at first anterior but the kidney rotates 90° medially.</p><p><strong>Anomalies.</strong> Persistence of fetal lobulation is of no significance. Persistence of one of the fetal arteries is common (30% of individuals), especially a vessel from the aorta to the lower pole. Whether such vessels should be called accessory, abnormal, aberrant, supernumerary or whatever is debated. Fusion of the lower poles of the kidneys gives rise to horseshoe kidney (1 in 800); the ureters pass anterior to the isthmus of kidney substance, as does the inferior mesenteric artery which limits ascent of the horseshoe. Polycystic disease (1 in 500), a hereditary disorder which may be associated with cysts in the liver, pancreas and lungs, is possibly due to incomplete union of renal tubules proper with the collecting tubules of ureteric origin, but the precise cause is unresolved. One person in 500 has only one kidney (renal agenesis), a fact which must obviously be confirmed before considering nephrectomy.</p><p>For many operations on the kidney including removal (nephrectomy) and removal of stones (nephrolithotomy) a lumbar approach is used (p. 311). The renal fascia and perirenal fat are incised to expose the kidney, whose upper pole is freed leaving the suprarenal gland within its own compartment of the fascia. The overlying peritoneum is pushed away forwards and medially. The renal vessels can then be exposed and ligated (the artery before the vein) to mobilize the organ further and transect the ureter. On the right a diseased kidney may adhere to the colon, ureter, duodenum, inferior vena cava or suprarenal gland, and on the left to the colon, ureter, spleen, pancreas and suprarenal. The right renal vein is only 2.5 cm long, so the inferior vena cava is very near the operation area.</p><p>For percutaneous renal biopsy, the lower pole of the kidney is entered by an approach 2.5 cm below the twelfth rib and at a distance from the midline determined radiologically. Damage to a renal vessel or calyx is a potential hazard, and the needle is only advanced while the patient is holding the breath so that the kidney is not torn by respiratory movement.</p><p>For transplantation, the donor kidney is placed retroperitoneally in the iliac fossa with the hilum parallel to the external iliac vessels. The renal artery is anastomosed to the internal or external iliac artery and the renal vein to external iliac vein. The ureter is implanted into the anterior surface of the bladder.</p><h2 id=ureters>Ureters
<a class=anchor href=#ureters>#</a></h2><p>The ureter is 25 cm (10 in) long. Its points of narrowest caliber are at the pelviureteric junction, at the halfway mark where it crosses the pelvic brim, and at its termination in the bladder mucosa.</p><p>The ureter passes down on major psoas under cover of the peritoneum and crosses the genitofemoral nerve, being itself crossed superficially by the gonadal vessels. On the right the upper part is behind the duodenum, while lower down it is crossed by the root of the mesentery and by the right colic, ileocolic and superior mesenteric vessels. On the left it is lateral to the inferior mesenteric vessels and is crossed by the left colic vessels and (just before entering the pelvis) by the apex of the sigmoid mesocolon. It leaves the psoas muscle at the bifurcation of the common iliac artery, over the sacroiliac joint, and passes into the pelvis (p. 383). It adheres to the peritoneum of the posterior abdominal wall when that membrane is stripped up from the psoas fascia. It can be identified from vessels and nerves in the living body by the fact that it is a whitish cord which is non-pulsatile and which shows peristaltic activity when gently pinched with forceps. On the left the apex of the sigmoid mesocolon is the guide to it as it enters the pelvis.</p><p>Its surface markings are of use in palpating it for tenderness and in identifying radiographic shadows. On the anterior abdominal wall it can be marked from the tip of the ninth costal cartilage to the bifurcation of the common iliac artery. This latter point is found by joining the point of bifurcation of the abdominal aorta (2 cm below and to the left of the umbilicus) to a point midway between the anterior superior iliac spine and the pubic symphysis. The common iliac artery bifurcates one-third of the way down this line.</p><h2 id=blood-supply-3>Blood Supply

<a class=anchor href=#nerve-supply-2>#</a></h2><p>Although sympathetic fibers from T11-L2 segments of the cord reach the ureter via the celiac and hypogastric plexuses, together with parasympathetic fibers from the pelvic splanchnic nerves, their functional significance is not clear. Intact innervation of the renal pelvis or ureter is not necessary for the initiation or propagation of peristalsis from the calyceal pacemakers. There are no ganglion cells in or on the ureter. Pain fibers accompany sympathetic nerves, as from the kidney (p. 369).</p><h2 id=structure-3>Structure
<a class=anchor href=#structure-3>#</a></h2><p>The ureter is a tube of smooth muscle lined internally by mucous membrane. The muscle often appears histologically to be arranged as a middle circular layer with inner and outer longitudinal layers. However, it is more accurate to consider the muscle as a single coat with fibers running in many different directions because they are parts of intertwining helices. The lax mucous membrane is lined by transitional epithelium; there is no muscularis mucosae. The typical transverse histological section has a characteristic stellate lumen, but in life when containing urine the lumen is round. The outer adventitial layer receives the incoming blood vessels (see above).</p><p>The ureter is of mesodermal origin; it is derived by a process of budding from the caudal end of the mesonephric duct (p. 43). Its upper end divides into two or three (the major calyces of the renal pelvis) and further subdivisions produce the minor calyces and collecting tubules. Low division of the ureteric bud produces double ureter.</p><h2 id=suprarenal-glands>Suprarenal Glands
<a class=anchor href=#suprarenal-glands>#</a></h2><p>These glands lie one alongside the upper part of each kidney (Fig. 5.29). They are somewhat asymmetrical and rather yellowish in color, and lie within their own compartment of the renal fascia. Adrenal gland is an alternative name.</p><p>The right suprarenal gland is pyramidal in shape and surmounts the upper pole of the right kidney. It lies between the inferior vena cava and the right crus of the diaphragm, its right border projecting to the right of the vena cava and its upper part coming into contact with the bare area of the liver. Only the lower half of it has a peritoneal covering (hepatorenal pouch, greater sac). The right inferior phrenic vessels are near its medial border.</p><p>The left suprarenal gland is crescentic in shape and drapes over the medial border of the left kidney above the hilum. Its lower pole is covered in front by the body of the pancreas and the splenic artery, the rest of the gland being covered with peritoneum of the lesser sac and forming part of the stomach bed. It lies on the left crus of the diaphragm with the left inferior phrenic artery adjacent. The medial border is to the left of the celiac ganglion and probably overlapped by the left gastric vessels, with the left greater splanchnic nerve behind it.</p><p>Both glands receive blood from three sources: from the inferior phrenic and renal arteries and from the aorta (p. 359). Each source provides several small branches, not just a single vessel. In contrast there is usually a single vein (very rarely double or triple on the right). The right vein is only a few millimeters long and enters the vena cava; the left vein is longer and enters the left renal vein. In each case the suprarenal vein drains into a persisting segment of the subcardinal vein of the embryo (p. 45).</p><p>To para-aortic nodes.</p><p>The main supply is by myelinated preganglionic sympathetic fibers from the splanchnic nerves via the aortic and renal plexuses; the fibers synapse directly with medullary cells (p. 30). Blood vessels in all parts receive the usual postganglionic sympathetic supply, although cortical control is not neural but by ACTH from the anterior pituitary.</p><h2 id=structure-4>Structure
<a class=anchor href=#structure-4>#</a></h2><p>To the naked eye a section across the suprarenal resembles a sandwich. Two layers of cortex (the bread) enclose a much thinner layer of medulla (the meat) between them. In places there is no medulla, and the two layers of cortex then meet each other. The cortex, whose principal products are cortisol, aldosterone, androgens and related hormones, consists of three layers or zones. Immediately beneath the connective tissue capsule is the zona glomerulosa, with small rounded groups of cells. The second layer is the largest of the three, the zona fasciculata, consisting of parallel rows of pale-staining vacuolated cells with a high cholesterol content. The innermost zona reticularis is a network of smaller and darker-staining cells. The rather small central medulla has larger cells secreting the catecholamines adrenaline (80%) and noradrenaline (20%) and some dopamine. Many of the medullary cells exhibit the chromaffin reaction: they contain fine cytoplasmic granules (the catecholamine precursors) which are colored brown by chromium salts. Dilated capillaries are usually prominent in the medulla but not in the cortex; as in any endocrine tissue, many are present but are collapsed in histological sections.</p><p>The medulla is derived by migration of cells from the neural crest and is ectodermal in origin while the cortex is derived in situ from the mesoderm of the intermediate cell mass (p. 36).</p><p>For suprarenalectomy (adrenalectomy) the glands are usually approached from the front. The right gland is exposed by incising the peritoneum over the upper pole of the kidney. On the left the stomach and spleen are retracted medially; the peritoneum between the splenic flexure of the colon and the esophageal opening in the diaphragm is incised and a flap of peritoneum stripped medially towards the right with the spleen and its vessels and the tail of the pancreas until the gland is exposed on the medial side of the upper pole of the kidney. On each side the suprarenal vein is ligated before the numerous small arteries; the right vein is particularly short and the vena cava is easily torn. The glands must be handled as little as possible before venous ligation to prevent surges of hormone release.</p><h2 id=bony-pelvis>Bony Pelvis
<a class=anchor href=#bony-pelvis>#</a></h2><p>The individual features of the hip bone (p. 215), sacrum (p. 552) and coccyx (p. 554) are considered separately. When articulated the bones enclose a cavity; from the brim of the cavity the ala of each ilium projects up to form the iliac fossa, part of the posterior abdominal wall. The pelvic brim is formed in continuity by the pubic crest, pectineal line of the pubis, arcuate line of the ilium, and the ala and promontory of the sacrum. The plane of the brim is oblique, lying at 60° with the horizontal (Fig. 5.51); the vagina is in the same plane. From the brim the pelvic cavity projects back to the buttocks.</p><p>Sex differences are striking and easily recognized; they are due to the two facts that the female pelvis is broader than that of the male for easier passage of the fetal head and that the female bones, including the head of the femur, are more slender than those of the male. In the male pelvis the sturdy bones make an acute subpubic angle (Fig. 5.50), pointed like a Gothic arch, while in the female the slender bones make a wide subpubic angle, rounded like a Roman arch. The outline of the pelvic brim differs. In the male the sacral promontory indents the outline, and the brim is widest towards the back (a heart-shaped outline) while in the female there is less indentation of the outline by the sacral promontory and the brim is widest further forwards (a transversely oval outline). Sex differences in the hip bone (p. 221) and sacrum (p. 554) are equally obvious in the articulated pelvis.</p><p>Hold an articulated pelvis in the position it occupies in the erect individual, and note the degree of tilting of the hip bone and sacrum. The anterior superior iliac spines and the upper margin of the symphysis pubis lie in the same vertical plane. Note an important horizontal plane - the upper border of the symphysis pubis, the spine of the ischium, the tip of the coccyx, the head of the femur and the apex of the greater trochanter lie in the one plane (Fig. 5.50). This plane passes through the.</p><p>Fig. 5.50 Male pelvis, from the front. An imaginary horizontal plane through the top of the pubic symphysis traverses the tip of the coccyx, the ischial spine (S), the center of the acetabulum and femoral head, and the tip of the greater trochanter.</p><p>Pelvic cavity at a level with the tip of the finger of the clinician during rectal or vaginal examination. The ovaries in the female and the seminal vesicles in the male lie in this plane.</p><p>The word pelvis is Latin for a basin and, when properly tilted forwards into the anatomical position, the bony pelvis does bear some resemblance to a pudding basin but with much of the front wall missing. The deficiency is made good by the lower part of the anterior abdominal wall where the aponeuroses of all three anterolateral muscles lie in front of rectus abdominis.</p><p>The muscles of the pelvis are defined as obturator internus and piriformis (which are also classified as lower limb muscles) and levator ani and coccygeus, which, with their fellows of the opposite side, constitute the pelvic floor or pelvic diaphragm (the terms are synonymous).</p><p>The side wall of the pelvis is formed by the hip bone, clad with obturator internus and its fascia. The curved posterior wall is formed by the sacrum with piriformis passing laterally into the greater sciatic foramen.</p><h2 id=piriformis>Piriformis
<a class=anchor href=#piriformis>#</a></h2><p>Piriformis arises from the middle three pieces of its own half of the sacrum and the adjoining lateral mass. The origin extends medially between the anterior sacral foramina, so that the emerging sacral nerves and sacral plexus lie on the muscle (Fig. 5.55). It runs transversely to the greater sciatic foramen. The pelvic surface of the muscle and the sacral plexus are covered by a strong membrane of pelvic fascia attached to the sacral periosteum at the margin of the muscle; elsewhere the sacrum presents bare bone. The course of the muscle in the gluteal region, its nerve supply and action are described on page 164.</p><h2 id=obturator-internus>Obturator Internus
<a class=anchor href=#obturator-internus>#</a></h2><p>Examine the hip bone. The large obturator foramen contains in life a felted mass of fibrous tissue, the obturator membrane (Fig. 5.51), with a gap above that converts the obturator notch into a canal for the obturator nerve and vessels (Fig. 3.55, p. 218). The muscle arises from the whole membrane and from the bony margins of the foramen (Fig. 5.62). The origin extends posteriorly as high as the pelvic brim and across the flat surface of the ischium to the margin of the greater sciatic notch. On the ischial tuberosity the origin extends down to the falciform ridge. From this wide origin the muscle fibers converge fan-wise towards the lesser sciatic notch. Above the notch is a curved bare area of bone, with a large bursa lying on it beneath the muscle. Tendinous fibers develop on the muscle surface where it bears on the lesser sciatic notch and the bone often shows low ridges and grooves where the tendon takes a right-angled turn to pass into the buttock (Fig. 3.55, p. 218). It is described further on page 165.</p><p>Note the extent of the upper margin of the muscle. From the pelvic brim at the sacroiliac joint the line slopes downwards along the side wall of the pelvis until anteriorly it lies below the obturator canal. Above this line lies bare bone; below it the muscle is covered with a strong membrane, the obturator fascia. This is attached to bone at the margins of the muscle down to the falciform edge of the sacrotuberous ligament on the ischial tuberosity. The white line for origin of levator ani slopes across the obturator internus fascia (the pelvic cavity is above this line, the ischioanal fossa below it). The posterior surface of the body of the pubis and of the pubic symphysis is bare of both muscle and fascia (Fig. 5.52). Do not confuse the obturator membrane (in the foramen) with the obturator fascia on the internal surface of the muscle.</p><h2 id=pelvic-floor>Pelvic Floor
<a class=anchor href=#pelvic-floor>#</a></h2><p>The pelvic floor consists of a gutter-shaped sheet of muscle, the pelvic diaphragm, slung around the midline body effluents (urethra and anal canal and, in the female, the vagina).</p><p>The muscles of the pelvic floor are called coccygeus and levator ani, but it is better to regard them as one morphological entity, ischiococcygeus, iliococcygeus and pubococcygeus from behind forwards. They arise in continuity from the spine of the ischium, from the white line over the obturator fascia, and from the body of the pubis, and are inserted into the coccyx and the anococcygeal ligament (p. 405), a fibromuscular band, the deepest part of which can be called the anococcygeal raphe, being formed by interdigitating fibers of levator ani (Fig. 5.53). From their origin the muscle fibers slope downwards and backwards to the midline; the pelvic floor so produced is a gutter that slopes downwards and forwards. Appreciation of this point clarifies the whole of obstetrical mechanics - the lowest part of the fetus is the first to meet this sloping gutter and during delivery is mechanically rotated to the front.</p><p>The human coccygeus is best thought of as ischiococcygeus. In the tailed animals this muscle is the agitator caudae. Man has no tail to wag and the muscle is degenerating. Its gluteal surface is, indeed, not muscle, but fibrous tissue, and is none other than the sacrospinous ligament. It arises from the tip of the ischial spine, alongside the posterior margin of obturator internus. Its fibers fan out to be inserted into the side of the coccyx and the lowest piece of the sacrum; it lies edge to edge with the lower border of piriformis (Fig. 5.52; compare with Fig. 5.51). <strong>Nerve supply.</strong> By perineal branches of S4 and S5.</p><p>Levator ani consists of two parts, iliococcygeus and pubococcygeus (Fig. 5.53), often separated by a triangular gap. Their fibers arise in continuity, from the ischial spine to the body of the pubis, across the obturator fascia. Here is a thickening, the white line or arcus tendineus (Fig. 5.52). It is densely adherent to the obturator fascia and is usually described as a thickening thereof. This is not really correct; it is the property of levator ani, not of the obturator fascia. The levator ani originally arose from the pelvic brim (its present origin in most mammals) and in man has migrated down the side wall of the pelvis, bringing the tendinous arch with it; in rare cases the arch hangs free between ischial spine and pubis, with levator ani swinging from it.</p><p>The pubococcygeus part is that part of levator ani which arises from the anterior half of the white line and from the posterior surface of the body of the pubis on a level with the lower border of the pubic symphysis (Fig. 5.52). There is often a triangular gap between the adjacent borders of this muscle and iliococcygeus. The pubococcygeus forms a flat muscle whose fibers are in different functional sets. The bulk of its posterior fibers (i.e. those arising from the white line) sweep backwards in a flat sheet on the pelvic surface of the iliococcygeus and are inserted into the tip of the coccyx and the anococcygeal ligament and raphe (Fig. 5.53). These constitute the pubococcygeus muscle proper. Fibers arising more anteriorly, from the periosteum of the body of the pubis, swing more medially and more inferiorly around the anorectal junction and join with fibers of the opposite side and with the posterior fibers of the deep part of the external anal sphincter. No raphe exists here, and the muscles form a U-shaped sling which holds the anorectal junction angled forwards; this part of the muscle is called puborectalis (Figs 5.52, 5.54 and 5.65). More medially still, a U-shaped sling of fibers passes behind the prostate into the perineal body; this part is named levator prostatae. In the female a similar muscular sling passes behind the vagina into the perineal body, as pubovaginalis, or sphincter vaginae. The most medial fibers are adjacent to the urethra (p. 393) and can exert some sphincteric action. Do not confuse this sphincter vaginae of the pelvic floor with the sphincter of the introitus (the bulbospongiosus muscles). The puboprostatic and pubovaginal slings are of fibers that interdigitate widely, between the pelvic floor and the skin of the perineum, bound together by fibrous tissue and constituting the perineal body, now called the central perineal tendon (p. 405).</p><p>The whole pelvic floor is thus seen to consist of a gutter-shaped muscular diaphragm, the fibers of which are arranged in a series of U-shaped loops sloping progressively downwards towards the midline (Fig. 5.53). The fibers of the U-shaped loops are inserted progressively into the coccyx and the anococcygeal raphe from behind forwards, and when traced in this direction the anterior fibers overlap the upper or pelvic surface of the posterior fibers of the raphe.</p><p>Fig. 5.54 Female pelvic effluents. The pubovesical ligament is attached to the bladder neck (in the male this is the puboprostatic ligament). The pubovaginalis parts of levator ani converge on to the perineal body behind the vagina (in the male, levator prostatae). The puborectalis sling is identical in both sexes, and behind this the anococcygeal ligament and raphe receive the other fibers of levator ani.</p><p>There is a gap anteriorly between the medial edges of the levator prostate (pubovaginalis) parts. This is almost completely filled by the puboprostatic ligaments in the male and the pubovesical ligaments in the female. In the midline between these ligaments lies the deep dorsal vein of the penis or clitoris (Fig. 5.54).</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> In the light of electrophysiological studies on patients during pelvic operations, long-standing views on the innervation of the pelvic floor must be revised. It now seems clear that all parts of levator ani, including puborectalis, are supplied by the perineal branches of S3 and S4 which enter the upper (pelvic) surface of the muscle. Some of these somatic fibers may travel in or very close to the pelvic splanchnic nerves. The inferior rectal branch (S2) of the pudendal nerve supplies the external sphincter, not levator ani, and S4 does not supply the sphincter. Levator ani, like the external anal and urethral sphincter muscles, has a high proportion of slow twitch fibers.</p><p><strong>Actions.</strong> The pelvic floor helps to support the pelvic viscera and retain them in their normal positions, and it is active in quiet respiration. The floor contracts to counteract increased intra-abdominal pressure, which may be momentary, as in coughing and sneezing, or more prolonged as in muscular efforts like lifting. If an expulsive effort is required, the floor relaxes. Thus in defecation (p. 404) when the abdominal wall and diaphragm contract, puborectalis relaxes to straighten out the anorectal junction and the floor descends to become more funnel-shaped, rising again as the process comes to an end. The pubovaginalis fibers of levator ani may be important in assisting the urethral sphincter at the end of micturition. In parturition the floor initially directs the fetal head to the pelvic outlet, but the degree of stretching to which the muscular and fibrous parts of the floor are subjected renders it liable to damage by tearing, hence the prophylactic use of episiotomy (p. 412).</p><p>The fascia of the pelvis is usually described under the headings parietal and visceral. Its arrangement is essentially simple, and this simplicity is best appreciated by considering the pelvic fascia under the headings of the pelvic wall, pelvic floor and pelvic viscera. Two principles govern the arrangements of the fascia. The first is that over non-expansile parts the fascia is a strong membrane, while over expansile or mobile parts no membrane exists, the fascia consisting here of a loosely felted areolar tissue. The second principle is that fascia does not extend over bare bone.</p><p>The fascia of the pelvic wall is a strong membrane which covers the muscles (obturator internus and piriformis) and is firmly attached to the periosteum at their margins. Elsewhere the bone of the pelvic wall is bare of fascia. An exception is the fascia of Waldeyer, which sweeps downwards from its attachment in the hollow of the sacrum to the ampulla of the rectum. The spinal nerves lie external to the fascia of the pelvic wall, the vessels lie internal to it. The sacral plexus lies behind the pelvic fascia, between it and the piriformis muscle, and its branches to the buttock do not, therefore, pierce the fascia. The vessels of the buttock (superior and inferior gluteal) on the other hand have to pierce this fascia to establish continuity between pelvis and buttock.</p><p>The fascia of the pelvic floor, though usually included under the term parietal pelvic fascia, bears no possible resemblance to that of the pelvic wall. Here is no inexpansile membrane; indeed such a structure would nullify the necessary mobility of the pelvic diaphragm. The surface of levator ani is covered with no more than the epimysium (loose areolar tissue) that distinguishes muscle surfaces anywhere in the body.</p><p>Between the pelvic floor and the pelvic peritoneum lie the pelvic viscera. The extraperitoneal space between these viscera is composed of loose areolar tissue, which forms dead space for distension of bladder and rectum, and vagina too. The space allows for ready compression during the passage of the fetus in childbirth. Through this loose tissue the infection in pelvic cellulitis travels widely and fast. In the dead-space tissue are found so-called ligaments which are of two types.</p><p>The fascia of the pelvic viscera is loose or dense in conformity with the distensibility of the organ. The non-distensible prostate is surrounded by a tough membrane of fascia; the highly distensible bladder and rectum have no membrane around their muscle walls, only a loose and cellular tissue invests them.</p><p>The Latin word rectus means straight, as if ruled. The rectum was originally named in monkeys in which it is straight, but the human rectum appears to be misnamed. Apart from following the posterior concavity of the sacrum and coccyx, it shows three slight lateral curves or flexures that are most prominent when the viscus is distended (Fig. 5.55): upper and lower curves convex to the right and a middle curve convex to the left, the result being that the middle part appears to bulge to the left. The lowest part is slightly dilated as the rectal ampulla. Corresponding to the three curves seen externally, there are three sickle-shaped transverse rectal folds, formerly called rectal valves (of Houston) that project into the lumen. They are produced by the circular muscle of the wall and are not confined merely to the mucous membrane as is the case with the circular folds of the duodenum and jejunum. Their purpose is not clear, but they may be concerned in the separation of flatus from the fecal mass, giving shelf-like support while allowing flatus to pass.</p><p>Fig. 5.55 Posterior half of a coronal section of the pelvis.</p><p>The rectum, which is about 12 cm (5 in) long, is continuous with the sigmoid colon at the level of the third piece of the sacrum and there is no change of structure at the junction. The distinction is merely a matter of peritoneal attachments; where there is a mesocolon the gut is called sigmoid, where there is no mesentery it is called rectum (compare the duodenum, retroperitoneal, and the jejunum on a mesentery). The rectum ends where its muscle coats are replaced by the sphincters of the anal canal. This is the anorectal junction, and it is slung in the U-loop of puborectalis, which forms a palpable landmark, the anorectal ring, on rectal examination (see below).</p><p>The three taeniae of the large intestine, having broadened out over the sigmoid colon, come together over the rectum to invest it in a complete outer layer of longitudinal muscle, so there are no sacculations as in the colon, and also there are no appendices epiploicae. From its commencement in the hollow of the sacrum at the level of the third piece it curves forward over the coccyx and anococcygeal raphe to pass through the pelvic floor into the anal canal just behind the perineal body. The anorectal junction lies at the pelvic floor 3 cm (1.5 in) above the cutaneous margin of the anus, at about 5 cm (2 in) from the tip of the coccyx in the position of rest. The anal canal runs from the termination of the rectum to the anal orifice (p. 400); it is in the perineum.</p><p>The rectum possesses no mesentery. Peritoneum covers the upper third of the rectum at the front and sides, and the middle third only at the front; the lower third is below the level of the peritoneum which is reflected forwards on to the upper part of the bladder (in the male) or upper vagina to form the rectovesical pouch or rectouterine pouch (of Douglas) (Fig. 5.61). These pouches form the lowest parts of the peritoneal cavity, and being 7.5 and 5.5 cm from the anal margins in the male and female respectively are within reach of the fingertip on rectal examination. They are normally occupied by coils of small intestine or sigmoid colon which also lie in the pararectal fossae on either side of the rectum.</p><p>In front of the rectovesical pouch is the upper part of the base of the bladder and the tips of the seminal vesicles. Below the level of the pouch are the rest of the bladder base and seminal vesicles, the prostate, and the ends of each ureter and ductus deferens (Fig. 5.56). A condensation of connective tissue, the rectovesical fascia (of Denonvilliers) intervenes between this part of the rectum and the structures in front of it. It provides a firm barrier for at least the initial stages of cancerous spread.</p><p>On each side the posterolateral relations of the rectum (Fig. 5.55) include the lower three pieces of the sacrum and the coccyx, the piriformis, levator ani and coccygeus muscles, the anterior rami of the lower three sacral and coccygeal nerves, the sympathetic trunk and pelvic splanchnic nerves, and branches of rectal vessels. The lower part of the rectum is anchored to the curve of the lower sacrum by a condensation of connective tissue commonly known as Waldeyer&rsquo;s fascia, while at the sides retroperitoneal tissue round the middle rectal vessels constitutes the lateral ligaments of the rectum. These, together with the way that the levator ani muscles become continuous with the external anal sphincter, all help to maintain the rectum in its normal position.</p><p>Some muscle fibers leave the lower part of each side of the rectal ampulla and pass forwards to the back of the urogenital diaphragm, behind the rectovesical fascia. They form the rectourethralis muscles which, with the puborectales, must be cut at operations for excising the rectum.</p><p>Fig. 5.56 Male pelvic viscera and vessels of the central and left parts of the pelvis. Most of the bladder has been removed, leaving only part of the trigone, in order to display the base of the prostate and the lower part of the left seminal vesicle and ductus deferens.</p><h2 id=blood-supply-4>Blood Supply
<a class=anchor href=#blood-supply-4>#</a></h2><p>This is derived principally from the superior rectal artery, with contributions from the middle and inferior rectal and median sacral vessels. The lower end of the inferior mesenteric artery enters the sigmoid mesocolon and changes its name to superior rectal on crossing the pelvic brim. It crosses the left common iliac vessels medial to the ureter and descends in the base of the medial limb of the mesocolon. At the level of S3 vertebra (where the rectum begins) it divides into various branches which, contrary to long-standing opinion, do not usually occupy the 3, 7 and 11 o&rsquo;clock positions as viewed in a patient in the lithotomy position (although these are the positions of the venous cushions in the anal canal - p. 403). These vessels sink into the muscular wall and supply the whole thickness of the rectal wall including the mucous membrane, and continue within the mucosa into the anal canal. The middle rectal arteries, which may be double or absent, reach the lower rectum from the side, along the lateral rectal ligaments, but the inferior rectal vessels penetrate the walls of the anal canal (below the level of levator ani) and their branches run upwards within the walls to reach the rectum. All these vessels supply all layers of the rectum and anastomose with each other. Experience in rectal surgery has shown that the inferior rectal artery is capable of supplying the rectum from below to a level at least as high as the peritoneal reflection from its anterior surface. The median sacral artery may make an unimportant contribution to the posterior wall in the region of the anorectal junction, but its main interest is that it may cause bleeding at operations in this region.</p><h2 id=lymph-drainage-6>Lymph Drainage
<a class=anchor href=#lymph-drainage-6>#</a></h2><p>Lymphatics run back with the branches of the superior and middle rectal and median sacral arteries. Lymphoid follicles in the mucous membrane provide the first filter. Thence vessels pierce the wall of the rectum and travel to nodes: (1) in the hollow of the sacrum along the median sacral artery, (2) on the side wall of the pelvis along the middle rectal artery, and (3) along the inferior mesenteric artery and upwards to the preaortic nodes at the origin of the latter vessel. All these nodes must be removed in the radical extirpation of malignant disease of the rectum.</p><h2 id=nerve-supply-3>Nerve Supply
<a class=anchor href=#nerve-supply-3>#</a></h2><p>The sympathetic supply is derived by branches directly from the hypogastric plexuses and by fibers which accompany the inferior mesenteric and superior rectal arteries from the celiac plexus. The parasympathetic supply is from S2 and 3 (or S3 and 4) by the pelvic splanchnic nerves, which are motor to rectal muscle. As from the bladder (p. 382) pain fibers appear to accompany both sympathetic and parasympathetic supplies.</p><h2 id=rectal-examination>Rectal Examination
<a class=anchor href=#rectal-examination>#</a></h2><p>The structures that can be palpated through the anal canal in either sex are the coccyx and sacrum behind, with the ischial spines and ischioanal fossae at the sides. The anorectal ring can be felt at the anorectal junction as a shelf-like projection over which the tip of the finger can be hooked when the patient bears down. In the male at the front the prostate can be felt (but normal seminal vesicles are not usually palpable). In the female the cervix is felt through the vaginal wall, with the uterosacral ligaments laterally and sometimes the ovaries (compare with vaginal examination, p. 393).</p><h2 id=development-1>Development
<a class=anchor href=#development-1>#</a></h2><p>The rectum (with its termination the anal canal) is derived from the anorectal canal (the dorsal part of the cloaca, p. 43). The anal membrane breaks down, at a site probably represented by the pectinate line in the anal canal (p. 402); the anal valves are said to indicate the remains of the membrane. The part of the anal canal continuous with the rectum above the pectinate line is endodermal, and the part below which is derived from the proctodeum is ectodermal, hence the difference in the blood and nerve supplies and lymph drainage of the upper and lower parts of the canal (p. 403).</p><h2 id=surgical-approach>Surgical Approach
<a class=anchor href=#surgical-approach>#</a></h2><p>With access to the pelvis through the anterior abdominal wall, tumors in the upper part of the rectum can be removed leaving the lower part and the anal canal intact (anterior resection). The rectum can be freed by incising the peritoneum at the level of the rectovesical (or rectouterine) pouch and dissecting it away from.</p><p>For complete excision of the rectum and anal canal, the freeing of the rectum as above is supplemented by a perineal approach (abdominoperineal resection), which includes dividing the pelvic floor (levator ani). Elliptical incisions either side of the anus allow the ischioanal fossae to be entered so that the tissues in front of the coccyx can be released to open up the space containing Waldeyer&rsquo;s fascia from below. The plane between the rectum and prostate (or rectum and vagina) is defined and opened up, and puborectalis divided to allow the freed bowel to be withdrawn through the perineum. A colostomy is usually made in the left iliac fossa.</p><p>The bladder is made of smooth muscle arranged in whorls and spirals - the detrusor muscle. It is adapted for mass contraction, not peristalsis. The muscle is lined by a loose and readily distensible mucous membrane, surfaced by transitional epithelium.</p><p>The form and size of the bladder are the same in both sexes. The distended bladder is globular (ovoid) in both sexes, while the empty bladder is flattened from above downwards by the pressure of the overlying intestines.</p><p>The standard description of the bladder applies to its undistended state, when it has the approximate shape of a three-sided pyramid with the sharp apex pointing to the top of the pubic symphysis and a triangular base facing backwards (like the base of the heart) in front of the rectum or vagina. There are two inferolateral surfaces cradled by the anterior parts of levator ani, a neck where the urethra opens, and a superior surface which is the one that most obviously moves when the bladder fills. There are no hard and fast dividing lines between the various surfaces, especially when distended, but descriptions of the surfaces are convenient for emphasizing the bladder&rsquo;s position and relations.</p><p>The apex has the remains of the urachus attached to it, the latter forming the median umbilical ligament which runs up the midline of the anterior abdominal wall in the median umbilical fold of peritoneum (p. 313).</p><p>The base is the posterior surface, most of which in the male has no peritoneal covering, being below the level of the rectovesical pouch; only the uppermost part is covered</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"><span><a href=/anatomy-website/docs/lasts/04.-thorax/ class="flex align-center book-icon"><img src=/anatomy-website/svg/backward.svg class=book-icon alt=Previous title="04.
