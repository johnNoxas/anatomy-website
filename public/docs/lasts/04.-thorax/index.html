<h2 id="skin-and-subcutaneous-tissue">
  Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue
  <a class="anchor" href="#skin-and-subcutaneous-tissue">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The skin varies in texture, tending to be thin in front and thick behind. Distribution of hair varies with sex, age, and race. Natural tension lines of the skin are very constant, and are of tremendous importance to the cosmetic appearance of healed incisions. An incision along a tension line will heal as a hairline scar, virtually invisible; an incision across the lines will tend to heal with either a wide or a heaped-up scar. The tension lines run almost horizontally around the body wall (Fig. 1.2, p. 3).</p>
<p>The subcutaneous tissue is the same as elsewhere in the body (p. 3). Fat is contained in loculi, whose fibrous walls connect the overlying dermis to the underlying deep fascia. There is an exception over the dilatable part of the body wall, namely the anterior abdominal wall and lower part of the thoracic wall in front of the midaxillary lines. Here the fibrous septa of the subcutaneous tissue are condensed beneath the fat into a thin but strong membrane, properly called the membranous layer of superficial fascia, but still often known by its old name, the fascia of Scarpa. This fascia allows the subcutaneous fat (or fatty layer of superficial fascia, previously called the fascia of Camper) to slide freely over the underlying thoracic wall, rectus sheath, and external oblique aponeurosis. It fades out over the upper thoracic wall and along the midaxillary lines.</p>
<p>Below, over the thighs, it is attached to the fascia lata along the flexure skin crease of the hip, extending from the pubic tubercle obliquely outwards just below the inguinal ligament. The fascia of Scarpa is attached to the sides of the body of the pubic bone and is continued over the penis and scrotum, where it receives a different name, the superficial perineal fascia of Colles (p. 406).</p>
<h2 id="blood-supply">
  Blood Supply
  <a class="anchor" href="#blood-supply">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The intercostal and the lumbar arteries pass forward in the neurovascular plane (p. 21) to supply the flanks; the internal thoracic and the superior and inferior epigastric arteries supply the ventral midline tissues. From all these arteries cutaneous branches pass to the superficial fat and skin. The venous return from the subcutaneous tissue does not follow the arteries. The blood is collected by an anastomosing network of veins that radiate away from the umbilicus. Below this level they pass to the great saphenous vein in the groin; above the umbilicus they run up to the lateral thoracic vein and so to the axillary vein. A few at the umbilicus drain the lower part of the ligamentum teres. The upper part of this ligament drains to the left branch of the portal vein; these paraumbilical veins may distend in portal obstruction, giving rise, if the distension spreads to the subcutaneous veins, to the caput Medusae. A longitudinal channel uniting the lateral thoracic veins with the superficial epigastric vein above the inguinal ligament can often be recognized in cases of obstruction of the inferior vena cava; it constitutes the thoracoepigastric vein and provides a communication between superior and inferior venae cavae.</p>
<p>Lymphatic channels from the subcutaneous tissue and skin follow the veins, to axillary and superficial inguinal nodes. From above the level of the umbilicus, lymph from the front of the body goes to the pectoral lymph nodes, from the back of the body to the scapular nodes. (For lymph drainage of breast, see p. 71). From below the umbilicus lymph from the anterior aspect of the abdominal wall and perineum goes to the medial group of superficial inguinal nodes, and from the lateral and posterior aspects of the abdominal wall to the lateral group.</p>
<h2 id="nerve-supply">
  Nerve Supply
  <a class="anchor" href="#nerve-supply">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Above the second rib, the skin is supplied by supraclavicular branches of the cervical plexus (C4, Fig. 1.12, p. 20). Below this level a midline strip of ventral skin is supplied by the anterior cutaneous branches of the spinal nerves from T2 to L1, which latter supplies suprapubic skin. A broad lateral strip is supplied by the lateral cutaneous branches of the spinal nerves from T2 or 3 to L1; these branches emerge in the midaxillary line. Their anterior and posterior branches each innervate an oblique zone of skin in regular sequence. Note that the lateral cutaneous branches of T12 and the iliohypogastric nerve descend over the iliac crest to supply the skin of the buttock. The ilioinguinal nerve has no lateral cutaneous branch; it is the collateral branch of the iliohypogastric, both coming from L1 nerve. A posterior strip of skin is innervated by the posterior rami of spinal nerves, by their medial branches in the upper part and their lateral branches in the lower part (Fig. 1.11, p. 20).</p>
<h2 id="morphology-of-body-wall-muscles">
  Morphology of Body Wall Muscles
  <a class="anchor" href="#morphology-of-body-wall-muscles">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The myotomes of the trunk developed from the segmentation of mesoderm divide into dorsal and ventral parts, innervated by dorsal (posterior) and ventral (anterior) rami of spinal nerves respectively. The dorsal muscle masses become the erector spinae group, hence their innervation by posterior rami. The ventral parts of the segments form three layers of muscles which encircle most of the body cavity, their fibers lying in different degrees of obliquity, with the nerves (and segmental vessels) between the middle and inner layers. The thoracic layers are reinforced with bony condensations (ribs). All three layers are supplied by anterior rami. The outer layer forms the external intercostal and serratus posterior muscles in the thorax and the external oblique in the abdomen (in the neck it forms scalenus posterior). The middle layer forms the internal intercostals in the thorax and the internal oblique in the abdomen (in the neck, scalenus medius). The inner layer forms the transversus thoracis group (innermost intercostals, transversus thoracis and subcostals, and the diaphragm which migrates caudally), and in the abdomen transversus abdominis, quadratus lumborum and levator ani (in the neck scalenus anterior, longus capitis and longus cervicis). However, near the midline the layers fuse, forming rectus abdominis in the abdomen and geniohyoid and the strap muscles in the neck; the thoracic representative of this fusion is the occasional rectus sternalis (Fig. 2.2, p. 55). The muscles of the limbs are generally believed to be developed from limb bud mesoderm, without contributions from trunk myotomes.</p>
<p>The skin and subcutaneous tissue of the thoracic wall having been studied (p. 241), it now remains to consider the muscles and skeletal structures. Details of the thoracic part of the vertebral column are given on page 539, and of thoracic vertebrae on page 548.</p>
<h2 id="thoracic-bones-and-cartilages">
  Thoracic Bones and Cartilages
  <a class="anchor" href="#thoracic-bones-and-cartilages">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The skeleton of the thoracic wall consists of the 12 thoracic vertebrae, the 12 pairs of ribs and costal cartilages and the sternum. The thoracic cavity is roofed in above the lung apices by the suprapleural membrane and is floored by the diaphragm. The floor is highly convex (domes of the diaphragm), so that the volume of the thoracic cavity is much less than inspection of the bony cage would suggest. The liver and spleen and the upper parts of the stomach and both kidneys lie in the abdominal cavity wholly or partly covered by ribs.</p>
<p>Ribs are used for breathing. The purpose of studying their joints and their muscles is to understand how this is brought about. Ribs are not primarily protective (heart and lungs are no more sensitive to external violence than unprotected abdominal viscera and modern thoracic surgery is not inhibited by them). Perhaps ribs are protective in fish against increased hydrostatic pressure. In snakes they are organs of locomotion - the rib ends act as feet inside the skin, instead of outside as in the invertebrate centipede. But in air breathing mammals the primary function of ribs is respiratory.</p>
<p>At the back the ribs articulate with the vertebral column in two places: by their heads (joints of the heads of the ribs) and by their tubercles (costotransverse joints). Collectively these form the costovertebral joints. At the front the ribs join their costal cartilages (costochondral joints). The upper seven costal cartilages articulate with the sternum at the sternocostal joints, the next three articulate with each other (interchondral joints) and the last two are free. The manubriosternal joint is a symphysis between the manubrium and body of the sternum, and the xiphisternal joint is a symphysis between the body and the xiphoid process.</p>
<p>The head of a typical rib possesses two articular facets that slope away from each other, separated by a ridge. Each facet makes a small synovial joint with a demifacet of a vertebral body; the lower rib facet with the upper costal facet of its own vertebra, and the upper facet with the lower costal facet of the vertebra above (Fig. 4.1). The ridge between the two is attached to the intervertebral disc by the intraarticular ligament. The front of the capsule of the synovial joints is reinforced by the radiate ligament which consists of three bands. The upper band passes across the joint to the body of the vertebra above, and the lower band to the vertebra below. The central band runs horizontally, deep to the anterior longitudinal ligament and across the intervertebral disc with which it blends, to join with fibers from the other side. This arrangement, known as the hypochordal bow, is of morphological interest since it explains the formation of the anterior arch of the atlas (p. 541). Note that the first rib articulates with T1 vertebra only, never coming into contact with C7, and the last two ribs also articulate only with their own vertebrae. In these instances the radiate ligament consists of two bands, not three.</p>
<p>The tubercle of a typical rib (p. 290) has two facets. The medial facet, covered with hyaline cartilage, articulates with a facet near the tip of the transverse process of its own vertebra, so forming a small synovial joint with its own capsule. In the upper six ribs and transverse processes these articular surfaces are reciprocally curved but lower down the series they are flat; these differences have implications for thoracic movements (p. 251). The lateral facet (nonarticular) gives attachment to the lateral costotransverse ligament which runs to the tip of the transverse process and is one of three ligaments helping to stabilize the joint. The other two are the costotransverse ligament, which occupies the space between the back of the neck of the rib and the front of the transverse process, and the superior costotransverse ligament, which passes as two laminae from the crest of the neck of the rib to the under surface of the transverse process of the vertebra above (Fig. 4.1). The anterior lamina is continuous with the posterior intercostal membrane; the posterior is in the same plane as the external intercostal muscle. Note that there are three ligaments called costotransverse - the costotransverse, the lateral costotransverse and the superior costotransverse. The lower two ribs make no synovial joints with transverse processes; the attachments are only ligamentous.</p>
<p>Every rib makes with its costal cartilage a primary cartilaginous joint. The costal cartilage represents no more than the unossified anterior part of a rib. The anterior end of the bony rib is deeply concave to receive the reciprocally convex end of the costal cartilage. No movement takes place at these joints.</p>
<p>Costal cartilages 6 and 7, 7 and 8, and 8 and 9 are joined to parts of adjacent surfaces of each other by small synovial joints, with their capsules reinforced by a few ligamentous fibers.</p>
<p>These joints are misleadingly named since they are between the sternum and costal cartilages, not the ribs, so sternochondral would be a more appropriate term. The first joint is exceptional in that the first costal cartilage articulates with the manubrium by a primary cartilaginous joint (Fig. 4.2). The cartilage is short and thick and capable of very little distortion. Thus the manubrium and the first ribs are fixed to each other and move together as one. This fixation is necessary to give stability to the clavicle and so to the pectoral girdle and upper limb (p. 63).</p>
<p>The next six costal cartilages each articulate with the sternum by a synovial joint - a single cavity except in the case of the second, where the cavity between the cartilage and manubrium is separate from that between the cartilage and body (Fig. 4.2).</p>
<p>At this symphysis between the manubrium and body of the sternum, the surfaces are covered by hyaline cartilage and there is an intervening disc of fibrocartilage which often becomes ossified in later life, but without fusion of the bones so that for respiratory purposes (p. 252) joint movement is maintained even in old age. Frequently (30%) cavitation appears in the disc so that the joint may appear to be synovial, but this is simply a degenerative change that does not alter the fact that the joint is a symphysis.</p>
<p>This is another symphysis, between the body of the sternum and the xiphoid process, with cartilage covered surfaces and a fibrocartilaginous disc. Ossification from middle age onwards is common.</p>
<h2 id="thoracic-muscles">
  Thoracic Muscles
  <a class="anchor" href="#thoracic-muscles">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The muscles of the thoracic wall lie in the same three morphological layers as those of the abdominal wall (pp. 242 and 295), but in the thoracic region they have become divided up by the presence of ribs that have grown out from the primitive vertebral arches into positions between the muscle somites (myotomes). As might be expected they are innervated segmentally by anterior rami. The outer thoracic layer forms the external intercostal muscles, corresponding to the single external oblique in the abdomen, but appears also to include the two small serratus posterior muscles which lie external to the erector spinae mass of the vertebral column. The middle layer forms the internal intercostals, corresponding to the single internal oblique. The inner layer is broken up into three groups of muscles, the subcostals, innermost intercostals and the transversus thoracis. This incomplete layer may be referred to, as a whole, as the transversus thoracis group. Between it and the middle layer is the neurovascular plane, continuous with that of the abdominal wall; in it run intercostal vessels and nerves, with their collateral branches (Fig. 1.10, p. 19).</p>
<h3 id="outer-layer">
  Outer Layer
  <a class="anchor" href="#outer-layer">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Two small muscles of the external layer do not attach themselves between ribs but extend medially to the vertebral column. They are the posterior serratus muscles. Supplied like the rest of the layer by anterior rami, they have migrated posteriorly, and lie on the surface of the erector spinae mass. Each arises from four spinous processes, two in the thorax and two beyond it, and each is inserted into four ribs just lateral to the erector spinae, i.e. just lateral to the angles of the ribs.</p>
<p>Serratus posterior superior arises from the spinous processes of the lowest two cervical and the upper two thoracic vertebrae and from the intervening supraspinous ligaments. The flat sheet of muscle slopes downwards on the surface of splenius and is inserted just lateral to the angles of ribs 2-5. Many tendinous fibers in the sheet of muscle give it a characteristic glistening appearance which provides a useful landmark in exposures of this region. The dorsal scapular nerve and vessels run down on the muscle, which is covered by levator scapulae and the rhomboids (Fig. 2.6, p. 59).</p>
<p>Serratus posterior inferior arises from the lower two thoracic and the upper two lumbar spinous processes and from the intervening supraspinous ligaments. The origin is an aponeurosis which fuses with the posterior lamella of the lumbar fascia deep to.</p>
<p>Although morphologically associated with the muscles of the back (p. 543), the levator costae muscles are functionally classified as thoracic muscles and so must be mentioned here. Each one of each of the 12 pairs is fan shaped, spreading down from near the tip of a transverse process (from C7 to T11 vertebra) to be inserted into the upper border of the rib below, lateral to its tubercle. Thus one passes to each rib and presumably helps to elevate it. They are the only thoracic muscles to be supplied by the posterior rami of spinal nerves (from C8 to T11), in keeping with their developmental origin.</p>
<p>The remaining muscles of the outer layer are the external intercostals. Examine a rib (Fig. 4.38). Note that the costal groove is bounded externally by a lip that projects downwards; internally the groove possesses a rounded border. The upper border of the rib is smoothly rounded. The fibers of the external intercostal muscles pass obliquely downwards and forwards from the sharp lower border of the rib above to the smooth upper border of the rib below (Fig. 4.4). Each muscle extends from the superior costotransverse ligament at the back of the intercostal space as far forwards as the costochondral junction; here it is replaced by the anterior intercostal membrane (Fig. 4.3). This extends to the side of the sternum. Between the bony ribs is muscle; between the costal cartilages is membrane.</p>
<p>This consists of the internal intercostal muscles. The fibers run downwards and backwards, from the costal groove to the upper border of the rib below (Fig. 4.3). Each muscle, unlike an external intercostal, extends as far forwards as the side of the sternum; it is replaced posteriorly by the posterior intercostal membrane, which extends from the angle of the rib to the superior costotransverse ligament at the posterior limit of the space (Fig. 4.3).</p>
<p>Of the three groups of muscles in this layer (Fig. 4.4), the innermost intercostals line the rib cage at the side, with the subcostals at the back, and the transversus thoracis at the front.</p>
<p>Lying in the paravertebral gutter are fibers, each crossing more than one intercostal space, that are better developed below than above and which constitute the subcostal muscles. The thin sheet of muscle so formed is separated from the posterior border of the innermost intercostals by a space across which the intercostal nerves and vessels are in contact with the parietal pleura.</p>
<p>Similar to the subcostals, the fibers of the innermost intercostal muscles (intercostales intimi) cross more than one intercostal space. They lie on the lateral part of the thoracic wall (Fig. 4.3), and are wider below than above.</p>
<p>Transversus thoracis arises from the lower end of the sternum, whence digitations diverge on each side, one to each costal cartilage from the second to the sixth inclusive. This muscle was formerly called sternocostalis, which was a more exact name. The transversus thoracis group is the best inclusive name for all three groups of the innermost layer because it conforms with the transversus abdominis muscle, with which it is morphologically identical.</p>
<p>The actions of thoracic muscles are considered on page 251.</p>
<p>The intercostal spaces (between the ribs) are filled in by the muscles of the three layers described above. Running in the plane between the intermediate and inner layers are the intercostal nerves and vessels (Fig. 4.4). The order from above downwards is vein, artery, nerve, all three being protected by the downward projection of the lower border of the rib. Thus a needle or trocar for pleural drainage (p. 281) is inserted just above the rib that forms the lower boundary of the space, in order to avoid the main nerve and vessels that are at its upper boundary. Similarly, for thoracotomy (p. 254) the periosteum is stripped off the upper half of a rib, not the lower, to keep as far away as possible from the neurovascular bundle. The collateral branches of nerve and vessels that run along the upper border of a rib are very small and can be ignored.</p>
<p>The mixed spinal nerve, having emerged from the intervertebral foramen and given off its posterior ramus, passes around in the neurovascular plane, between the internal intercostal and the transversus thoracis group of muscles. It gives off a small collateral branch, which is wholly concerned with the supply of the muscles of the space, the parietal pleura and the periosteum of the ribs and has no cutaneous branch. It runs just above the rib that forms the lower boundary of the space. The main nerve itself has a lateral cutaneous branch and a terminal anterior cutaneous branch. The lateral branch pierces the intercostal muscles and the overlying muscles of the body wall along the midaxillary line, and divides into an anterior and posterior branch to supply the skin over the space. The anterior cutaneous branch in the upper six spaces passes anterior to the internal thoracic artery and pierces the intercostal muscles to reach the skin. In its course around the space the intercostal nerve lies below the vein and artery (see above). In its course around the body wall the main nerve lies in a wider circle that embraces the narrower circle of the intercostal vessels; where the nerve crosses the artery it will always be nearer the skin (Fig. 1.10). At the back of the intercostal space the nerve crosses behind the artery; at the front of the space the nerve crosses in front of the internal thoracic artery. Between these points the nerve is confined in the neurovascular plane below the artery.</p>
<p>The first intercostal nerve is very small. It courses around beneath the flat inferior surface of the first rib (Fig. 6.7B, p. 443), some distance inside the external border of the rib, in contact with the endothoracic fascia and pleura. It supplies the intercostal muscles of the first space with motor and proprioceptive fibers, and the adjacent pleura and rib periosteum with sensory fibers. Note that the first intercostal nerve supplies no skin, lacking both lateral and anterior cutaneous branches.</p>
<p>The subcostal nerve (twelfth thoracic), although arising in the thorax, quickly leaves by passing behind the lateral arcuate ligament into the abdomen, below the subcostal artery and vein, and is described on page 360.</p>
<p>Arteries enter intercostal spaces at the back and front. At the back the upper two spaces are supplied by the superior intercostal artery. This is the descending branch of the costocervical trunk, which comes off from the second part of the subclavian artery (Fig. 4.5) behind scalenus anterior. It enters the thorax by passing across the front of the neck of the first rib; here it has the sympathetic trunk on its medial side, while the first thoracic nerve passes laterally across the first rib to join the brachial plexus. The supreme intercostal vein lies between the artery and the sympathetic trunk. At this point the sympathetic trunk frequently presents the cervicothoracic (stellate) ganglion, a fusion of the first thoracic with the inferior cervical ganglion.</p>
<p>At the front of the intercostal space the internal thoracic artery in the upper six spaces and the musculophrenic artery in the seventh, eighth and ninth spaces give off two anterior intercostal arteries that pass backwards and make an end-to-end anastomosis with the posterior vessels, which are larger than the anterior. There are no anterior intercostal arteries in the last two spaces.</p>
<h2 id="intercostal-veins">
  Intercostal Veins
  <a class="anchor" href="#intercostal-veins">#</a>
</h2>
<p>In each space there are one posterior and two anterior intercostal veins, accompanying the arteries of the same names. The anterior veins drain into the musculophrenic and internal thoracic veins. The posterior veins are not regular. In the lower eight spaces they drain into the azygos system: the azygos vein on the right and the hemiazygos and accessory hemiazygos on the left. The first space is drained by the highest or supreme intercostal vein which opens either into the vertebral vein or the brachiocephalic vein of its own side. The blood from the second and third intercostal spaces, and sometimes from the fourth also, is collected into a single trunk on each side, the superior intercostal vein. That on the right drains simply into the azygos vein (Fig. 4.14). That on the left runs forward over the arch of the aorta, superficial to the vagus nerve and deep to the phrenic nerve, to empty into the left brachiocephalic vein (Fig. 4.15).</p>
<p>The lymph vessels of the intercostal space conform to the general rule that deep lymphatics follow arteries. From the front of the space vessels pass to the anterior intercostal (parasternal) nodes that lie along the internal thoracic artery; from the back of the space they drain to posterior intercostal nodes (p. 279).</p>
<p>From the first part of the subclavian artery, the internal thoracic artery (formerly the internal mammary) passes vertically downwards a finger&rsquo;s breadth from the border of the sternum. It gives off two anterior intercostal arteries in each intercostal space. At the costal margin it divides into the superior epigastric and musculophrenic arteries. The former passes lateral to the xiphisternal fibers of the diaphragm to enter the rectus sheath behind the muscle. The latter passes along the costodiaphragmatic gutter and gives off two anterior intercostal arteries in each space; it ends by piercing the diaphragm to ramify on its abdominal surface. The internal thoracic artery is accompanied by two venae comitantes that empty into the brachiocephalic vein.</p>
<p>The artery gives off a pericardiacophrenic branch that runs with the phrenic nerve and supplies branches to the nerve itself, pleura and fibrous and parietal pericardium.</p>
<p>Perforating branches emerge towards the surface from each intercostal space. They are especially large in the second and third spaces of the female for supply of the breast. Thus the internal thoracic artery supplies the anterior body wall from the clavicle to the umbilicus.</p>
<h2 id="suprapleural-membrane">
  Suprapleural Membrane
  <a class="anchor" href="#suprapleural-membrane">#</a>
</h2>
<p>This is a rather dense fascial layer (Sibson&rsquo;s fascia) attached to the inner border of the first rib and costal cartilage. It is not attached to the neck of the first rib, across which the first thoracic nerve passes to join the brachial plexus (Fig. 4.5). It has the cervical dome of the pleura attached to its under surface, and when traced medially it is found to thin out and disappear into the mediastinal pleura. It is flat and lies in the oblique plane of the thoracic inlet, projecting scarcely at all into the root of the neck. Lying on it are the subclavian vessels and other structures seen in the root of the neck (p. 255). Its posterior attachment is to the transverse process of C7 vertebra, where muscular fibers may be found in it. This is the scalenus minimus (or pleuralis) muscle, and the suprapleural membrane is to be regarded as the flattened-out tendon of the muscle. The function of the membrane is to give a rigidity to the thoracic inlet that prevents distortion during respiratory changes of intrathoracic pressure. If it were not a flat and unyielding structure, it and the neck structures above it would be puffed up and down during respiration. Actually it is moved only in forced respiration.</p>
<p>The diaphragm is a thin sheet of muscle caudal to the lungs. Its purpose is essentially for inspiration. It is present only in placentalia.</p>
<p>Morphologically the diaphragm is a derivative of the inner (transversus) layer of the muscles of the body wall. In the mammals this innermost sheet descended from the thoracic inlet to the lower margin of the thoracic cage. Embryologically a similar descent occurs. Being derived from the inner layer, its fibers arise in continuity with those of transversus abdominis from within the costal margin. It is completed behind the costal origin by fibers that arise from the arcuate ligaments and the crura. From the circumference of this oval origin the fibers arch upwards into a pair of domes and then descend to a central tendon which has no bony attachment.</p>
<p>Viewed from the side the profile of the diaphragm resembles an inverted J, the long limb extending up from the crura (upper lumbar vertebrae) and the short limb attached to the xiphisternum (level of T8 vertebra). Viewed from above the outline is kidney shaped, in conformity with the oval outline of the body wall which is indented posteriorly by the vertebral column (Fig. 1.10, p. 19).</p>
<p>Trace the origin from behind. The crura are strong tendons attached to the bodies of the upper lumbar vertebrae at the lateral margins of their anterior convexities, alongside the psoas muscle. The large right crus is fixed to the upper three lumbar vertebrae and the discs between them, the smaller left crus to the upper two lumbar vertebrae and the intervening disc. Muscle fibers radiate from each crus, overlap, and pass vertically upwards before curving forwards into the central tendon. Some of the fibers on the abdominal surface of the right crus slope up to the left and surround the esophageal orifice in a sling-like loop (Fig. 5.29, p. 333). Tendinous fibers from the medial edge of each crus unite with one another in front of the aorta at the level of T12 vertebra to form the median arcuate ligament. The medial arcuate ligament is a thickening in the psoas fascia. It extends from the lower part of the body of L1 (or sometimes L2) vertebra to a ridge on the anterior surface of the transverse process of L1 vertebra, at the lateral margin of psoas. From this ridge the lateral arcuate ligament extends across to the twelfth rib at the lateral border of quadratus lumborum; it is a thickening in the anterior layer of the lumbar fascia. Muscle fibers arise alongside the crus from the medial and lateral arcuate ligaments (but not from the median). Further laterally a digitation comes from the tip of the twelfth rib, thence around the costal margin a digitation arises from each costal cartilage and adjacent rib up to the seventh. These muscular slips all arise from within the costal cartilages and ribs, interdigitating with the slips of origin of transversus abdominis. Finally, in front, the muscle sheet is completed by fibers that pass backwards from the xiphisternum to the central tendon. These are the shortest muscle fibers of the diaphragm; the longest fibers are those which arise from the ninth costal cartilage.</p>
<p>The central tendon is shaped like the club on a playing card. A rounded leaf, placed nearer the front than the back, is fused on each side with a similar leaf that extends back towards the paravertebral gutter. The tendon, consisting of interlaced fibers, is inseparable from the fibrous pericardium, with which it is embryologically identical. Near the junction of central and right leaves it is pierced by a foramen, the vena caval opening, to which the adventitial wall of the inferior vena cava is very strongly attached (Fig. 5.29, p. 333).</p>
<h2 id="openings-in-the-diaphragm">
  Openings in the Diaphragm
  <a class="anchor" href="#openings-in-the-diaphragm">#</a>
</h2>
<p>For the passage of structures between thorax and abdomen there are three large openings in the diaphragm and several smaller ones.</p>
<p>The aortic opening is opposite T12 vertebra. It is a midline arch between the overlapping right and left crural fibers, behind the median arcuate ligament and therefore behind the diaphragm, not in it. It transmits the aorta with the azygos vein to the right and the thoracic duct leading up from the cisterna chyli between them (although the vein or duct may make their own holes in the right crus).</p>
<p>The esophageal opening is opposite T10 vertebra, usually an inch to the left of the midline (but it may be in the midline, its developmental position), behind the seventh left costal cartilage. It lies in the fibers of the left crus, but a sling of fibers from the right crus passes on the abdominal surface of these to loop around it. It transmits the esophagus, which is firmly attached by fibrous tissue to the sling. This phrenoesophageal ligament is stretched in the sliding type of hiatus hernia (p. 251). The vagal trunks and the esophageal branches of the left gastric artery, with accompanying veins and lymphatics, perforate the fibrous tissue to accompany the esophagus.</p>
<p>The vena caval foramen is opposite T8 vertebra just to the right of the midline, behind the sixth right costal cartilage and lies in the central tendon. The right phrenic nerve pierces the central tendon alongside the inferior vena cava at this opening (the two are separated in the mediastinum by the fibrous pericardium).</p>
<p>Other structures make their own smaller openings. The hemiazygos vein passes through the left crus. The greater, lesser, and least splanchnic nerves pierce each crus, the sympathetic trunk passes behind the medial arcuate ligament, the subcostal nerve and vessels pass behind the lateral arcuate ligament, while the left phrenic nerve pierces the muscle of the left dome. The neurovascular bundles of the seventh to the eleventh intercostal spaces pass between the digitations of the diaphragm and transversus abdominis into the neurovascular plane of the abdominal wall. The superior epigastric vessels pass between the xiphisternal and costal (seventh) fibers of the diaphragm. Finally extraperitoneal lymph vessels on the abdominal surface pass through the diaphragm to lymph nodes lying on its thoracic surface, mainly in the posterior mediastinum.</p>
<h2 id="blood-supply-1">
  Blood Supply
  <a class="anchor" href="#blood-supply-1">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The costal margin of the diaphragm is supplied by the lower five intercostal and the subcostal arteries. The main mass of fibers rising up from the crura are supplied on their abdominal surface by right and left inferior phrenic arteries from the abdominal aorta (Fig. 5.29, p. 333). The tiny pericardiacophrenic artery, supplying the phrenic nerve and the pleura and the fibrous pericardium, is almost spent as it reaches the diaphragm.</p>
<h2 id="nerve-supply-1">
  Nerve Supply
  <a class="anchor" href="#nerve-supply-1">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Each half of the diaphragm, including the crus, is supplied by its own phrenic nerve (C3, 4, 5 but predominantly C4, p. 261). The part of the right crus that lies to the left of the esophageal opening is supplied by the left phrenic (because these muscle fibers are derived from left cervical myotomes). The lower intercostal nerves send some proprioceptive fibers to the periphery of the diaphragm but no motor fibers; the motor supply is solely from the phrenics. The right phrenic passes through the foramen for the inferior vena cava; the left pierces the muscular part in front of the central tendon and just to the left of the pericardium (p. 261). Reaching the abdominal surface of the diaphragm, both nerves divide into anterior, lateral and posterior branches which run radially giving off branches that enter the muscle from below to supply it with motor and sensory fibers. Incisions in the diaphragm are made either round the periphery or radially towards the site of entry of the main nerve to avoid cutting across the major branches.</p>
<p>Associated with a lifetime of constant activity, about 55% of diaphragmatic muscle fibers (and 65% of intercostal muscle fibers) are of the slow twitch variety.</p>
<h2 id="actions">
  Actions
  <a class="anchor" href="#actions">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The major role of the diaphragm is inspiratory, but it is used also in abdominal straining.</p>
<p><strong>Inspiration.</strong> When the fibers contract in tranquil inspiration only the domes descend; this sucks down the lung bases and does not disturb the mediastinum. In a deeper breath further descent of the domes, below the level of the central tendon, can depress the central tendon from T8 to T9 level. This stretches the mediastinum (traction on pericardium and great vessels) and no further descent of the tendon is possible. Further contraction of the muscle (maximum inspiration) now everts the ribs of the costal margin in the bucket handle movement (Fig. 4.10 and below).</p>
<p>Note the beneficial effect on the three main openings. As the diaphragm contracts intraabdominal pressure tends to rise, and the vena caval foramen (in the central tendon) is pulled widely open to assist venous return via the inferior vena cava. The esophageal opening is held closed by the pinchcock contraction of the muscle sling from the right crus, to discourage regurgitation of stomach contents. The aortic opening is unaffected because it is not within the diaphragm but behind it.</p>
<p>Hiccup (hiccough) is a (repeated) spasmodic contraction of the diaphragm, its contraction being followed immediately by closure of the glottis and subsequent release of the trapped air to produce the characteristic sound.</p>
<p><strong>Expiration.</strong> Whether expiration is tranquil or forced (coughing, sneezing, blowing, etc.) the diaphragm is wholly passive, its relaxed fibers being elongated by pressure from below.</p>
<p><strong>Abdominal straining.</strong> For evacuation of a pelvic effluent (defecation, micturition, parturition) its contraction aids that of the abdominal wall in raising intraabdominal pressure. It is much weaker than the powerful obliques, transversus and recti, so for maximum pressure a deep breath is held by a closed glottis, and the diaphragm is prevented from undue elevation by being pressed up against a cushion of compressed air. Forcible escape of some of this air causes the characteristic grunt.</p>
<p>During heavy lifting in the stooping position abdominal straining is beneficial. With the breath held and intracoelomic pressure raised as above, the vertebral column cannot easily flex; it is as though an inflated football filled the body from pelvic brim to thoracic inlet. The weight of the stooping trunk is supported on the football, freeing erector spinae to use all its power to lift the weight. Such acts are similarly accompanied on occasion by the characteristic grunt.</p>
<p>The origins of the muscle fibers and connective tissue elements of the diaphragm are different. The connective tissue is derived from several sources: the transverse septum, which gives rise to most of the central tendon; the esophageal mesentery, which forms the connective tissue round the esophageal and vena caval openings; and from the pleuroperitoneal membranes and mesoderm of the dorsal body wall, which form the connective tissue of the periphery of the diaphragm. The parts that form the central tendon remain as connective tissue, but the rest becomes invaded through the transverse septum by muscle cells derived from the third, fourth and fifth cervical myotomes. The muscle cells carry their own nerve supply with them, hence the motor supply from the phrenic nerves. At the junction of the lumbar and costal parts of the diaphragm (at the twelfth rib where the lateral arcuate ligament is attached), muscle fibers may be absent leaving only an area of connective tissue covered by pleura above and peritoneum below; this is the lumbocostal trigone. If the lumbar and costal elements fail to fuse at all, there will be a gap here - Bochdalek&rsquo;s foramen, a possible site for a congenital diaphragmatic hernia. This type of defect is commoner on the left, possibly because pressure from the liver on the right encourages earlier closure there, and a large defect present at birth may result in the stomach and other abdominal viscera herniating into the thoracic cavity. Another possible but smaller hernial site is at the junction of the costal and xiphoid origins - Morgagni&rsquo;s foramen.</p>
<h2 id="diaphragmatic-hernia">
  Diaphragmatic Hernia
  <a class="anchor" href="#diaphragmatic-hernia">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The congenital types of diaphragmatic hernia have just been mentioned. Of the acquired varieties, the commonest is the sliding type of hiatus hernia, through the esophageal opening. Here the phrenoesophageal ligament becomes stretched so that the gastroesophageal junction rises up into the thorax. In the much rarer gliding or paraesophageal type, the phrenoesophageal ligament is not stretched but a pouch of peritoneum, usually containing a pouch of stomach, projects upwards alongside the esophagus.</p>
<p>The main muscle actions in respiration can be summarized as follows. In quiet respiration, inspiration is due to the action of the diaphragm, the intercostal muscles adjacent to the sternum, and the scalene muscles. Sternocleidomastoid is an accessory muscle of inspiration, with the more lateral parts of the external intercostals assisting. The older teaching that the external intercostals were concerned with inspiration and the internal intercostals with expiration may have been a simple summary but is no longer tenable; modern investigations suggest that the intercostals are more important for twisting movements of the thorax than for respiration, though they probably help to prevent bulging of the interspaces. Expiration is largely passive but assisted by the oblique and transversus muscles of the abdominal wall and transversus thoracis. Erector spinae, quadratus lumborum (fixing the last rib), pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi can all assist in deep and forced inspiration.</p>
<p>All three diameters of the thorax - anteroposterior, transverse and vertical - are increased during inspiration. The anteroposterior diameter increases because the body of the sternum moves forward as the ribs are raised, and the sternal movement is facilitated by the hinge movement (up to about 7°) at the manubriosternal joint (Fig. 4.6). If this joint becomes ankylosed, thoracic expansion is virtually lost (as in emphysema) and only diaphragmatic respiration is possible. A typical upper rib is raised by movement along an axis that passes through the neck of the rib - the pump handle movement, with a rotation of the neck and a rotatory movement at the costotransverse joint (Fig. 4.7), for which purpose these joint surfaces in upper ribs are reciprocally curved. Lower ribs are elevated by movement along an axis that passes from the costochondral junction at the front to the joint of the head of the rib at the back - the bucket handle movement, as when lifting up the fallen handle from the side of a bucket (Fig. 4.8), for which purpose the surfaces of the costotransverse joints of lower ribs are flat, to allow a gliding movement. This increases the transverse diameter of the lower thorax. Change in the vertical extent of the thoracic cavity is due to diaphragmatic movement (Figs 4.9 and 4.10).</p>
<h2 id="movements-of-the-abdominal-wall">
  Movements of the Abdominal Wall
  <a class="anchor" href="#movements-of-the-abdominal-wall">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Since the volume of the abdominal cavity remains constant, the abdominal wall moves in accordance with changes in the thoracic cavity. Diaphragmatic inspiration and rib inspiration occur simultaneously, but each in itself produces opposite movements in the abdominal wall. In purely diaphragmatic breathing, with the ribs motionless, descent of the diaphragm is accompanied by passive protrusion of the relaxed abdominal wall; indeed no descent is possible without such protrusion. Ascent of the diaphragm is accompanied by retraction of the abdominal wall; indeed, it is the active contraction of the abdominal wall muscles that forces the relaxed diaphragm up. This to-and-fro movement of the abdominal wall is usually called abdominal respiration. It consists of alternate contraction of the diaphragm and the anterior abdominal wall.</p>
<p>In thoracic respiration the movements of the abdominal wall are purely passive. If the ribs are elevated the diaphragm is elevated with the up-going costal margin and the abdominal wall is sucked in. With &ldquo;Thoracic&rdquo; inspiration makes the upper abdominal wall hollow, abdominal inspiration makes the wall protrude. The ordinary simultaneous rib and diaphragm movements can be so balanced that the abdominal wall does not move at all. Thus may respiration function quite well in tight corsets, plaster casts, etc. In children and many women thoracic movement is greater than diaphragmatic movement. In men diaphragmatic movement is greater, especially as the years go by.</p>
<h2 id="central-control-of-respiration">
  Central Control of Respiration
  <a class="anchor" href="#central-control-of-respiration">#</a>
</h2>
<p>A number of cell groups in the pons and medulla (mostly in the reticular formation) control the respiratory cycle. In the medulla bilateral groups of cells in the region of the nucleus of the tractus solitarius appear to function as an inspiratory center which may be responsible for the rhythmicity of breathing (a kind of respiratory SA node). Their axons pass down the spinal cord to the contralateral phrenic nerve neurons. Other bilateral groups in and near the nucleus ambiguus influence abdominal and intercostal muscles. There are also neurons in the pons which can modify the activity of the medullary centers; these include the pneumotaxic center (situated near the superior cerebellar peduncle), which is believed to control the changeover from inspiration to expiration, and an ill-defined apneustic center which is also concerned with the duration of these respiratory phases. The cerebral cortex, diencephalon and hypothalamus can also exert their influence on respiration, either via the above centers or more directly to the anterior horn cells innervating respiratory muscles. Afferent vagal fibers (with cell bodies in the inferior vagal ganglion) provide information about tension in lung tissues. Hypoxia is detected peripherally (not centrally) by chemoreceptors in the carotid and aortic bodies (pp. 256 and 438); the brain itself responds to changes in carbon dioxide, not oxygen.</p>
<h2 id="cardiopulmonary-resuscitation">
  Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation
  <a class="anchor" href="#cardiopulmonary-resuscitation">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The cardinal features of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are recalled by the letters ABC: Airway, Breathing, Circulation. In unconscious patients lying on the back, the commonest cause of airway obstruction is the tongue falling back to the posterior pharyngeal wall. Extending the head and neck and holding the mandible forwards helps the tongue to come forwards to restore the airway (provided it is clear of foreign bodies such as vomit). Mouth-to-mouth breathing (ventilation) while holding the patient&rsquo;s nose shut is carried out to inflate the lungs. The restoration of blood circulation is considered on page 266.</p>
<p>Surgical access to thoracic structures involves some kind of thoracotomy. In the anterolateral or posterolateral type, skin and underlying muscles are incised along the line of the chosen rib (often fifth or sixth) so that the periosteum can be stripped off the upper half of the front and back of the rib (so keeping away from the intercostal nerve and vessels which run immediately below a rib). The periosteal bed of the rib can then be incised to enter the pleural cavity. The nerve to serratus anterior may have to be sacrificed when incising that muscle in order to give the necessary exposure.</p>
<p>In the combined thoracoabdominal incision, the line of approach is through the ninth intercostal space, removing part of the ninth costal cartilage at the costal margin and then incising the diaphragm, anterior abdominal wall and peritoneum. The diaphragm is incised near its periphery or radially towards the point of entry of the phrenic nerve, thus avoiding damage to the main branches of the nerve (p. 250).</p>
<p>The cavity of the thorax is completely filled laterally by the lungs, each lying in its pleural cavity. The space between the pleural cavities occupying the center of the thoracic cavity is the mediastinum. It contains the heart and great blood vessels, the esophagus, the trachea and its bifurcation, the thoracic duct and the phrenic and vagus nerves. It is a very mobile area, the lungs and heart being in rhythmic pulsation, and the esophagus dilating with each bolus that passes down it. Hence there is but a minimum of loose connective tissue between the mobile structures. They lie in mutual contact, but the spaces between them can be readily distended by inflammatory fluid, neoplasm, etc.</p>
<p>These loose spaces of the mediastinum, moreover, connect freely with those of the neck. Mediastinitis is an ever-present danger in infective collections in the neck.</p>
<h2 id="divisions-of-the-mediastinum">
  Divisions of the Mediastinum
  <a class="anchor" href="#divisions-of-the-mediastinum">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The essential point about the disposition of the great veins and arteries of the superior mediastinum is their asymmetry. The veins are on the right, the arteries on the left. Structures themselves symmetrical, be they midline like the trachea, or bilateral like the apices of the lungs or the phrenic and vagus nerves, thus have asymmetrical relationships on the right and left sides. On the right side they are in contact with veins, on the left side with arteries. Veins expand enormously, large arteries not at all, during increased blood flow. Thus there is much dead space on the right, none on the left, and it is into this space on the right side that tumors of the mediastinum or liquid collections tend to project.</p>
<p>At the thoracic inlet (Figs 4.12 and 6.7A, p. 443, often called clinically the thoracic outlet) the esophagus lies against the body of T1 vertebra. The trachea lies on the esophagus and may touch the jugular notch of the manubrium. The midline of the inlet is thus wholly occupied by these two tubes. At the inlet the apices of the lungs lie laterally, separated by vessels and nerves passing between the superior mediastinum and the neck. The concavity of the arch of the aorta lies in the plane of the sternal angle, i.e. the arch of the aorta lies wholly in the superior mediastinum, behind the manubrium. It does not pass from right to left, but from in front at the manubrium backwards to the body of T4 vertebra. It arches over the beginning of the left bronchus and the bifurcation of the pulmonary trunk (Fig. 4.16). The brachiocephalic trunk begins as a midline branch from the arch and immediately diverges to the right beside the trachea. The two other branches of the arch, the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries, pass upwards on the left side of the trachea, so that the thoracic part of the trachea is clasped by an asymmetrical V (Figs 4.12 and 4.13). These great arteries keep the left vagus nerve and apex of the left lung away from contact with the trachea. On the right side there is no structure to separate the trachea from the right vagus and apex of the right lung. Tracheal breath sounds are thus conducted, by direct contact, to the right apex. On the left side the great arteries intervene, and breath sounds are here more subdued, being conducted only along the bronchial tree.</p>
<p>mediastinum to join the right (Fig. 4.12). The confluence of the brachiocephalic veins produces the superior vena cava, which passes vertically downwards behind the right edge of the sternum, anterior to the right bronchus. Note that on the right side of the mediastinum the venous channels open into the right atrium, which forms the right border of the heart (Fig. 4.14). On the left side there are arterial channels, which are continuous with the left side of the heart, i.e. the right and left ventricles (Fig. 4.15). The phrenic nerves have, therefore, different relationships, the right to venous and the left to arterial structures.</p>
<p>Emerging from the pericardium the ascending aorta approaches the manubrium and then at the level of the manubriosternal joint becomes the arch which passes backwards over the left bronchus (Fig. 4.16) to reach the body of T4 vertebra just to the left of the midline. From its upper convexity, which reaches as high as the midpoint of the manubrium - a convenient surface marking - arise the three great arteries for the head and upper limbs: the brachiocephalic trunk, and the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries (Figs 4.13 and 4.15). The arch is crossed on its left side by the phrenic and vagus nerves as they pass downwards in front of and behind the lung root respectively. Between them lie the sympathetic and vagus branches to the superficial part of the cardiac plexus. The left superior intercostal vein passes forwards across the arch superficial to the vagus, deep to the phrenic, to empty into the left brachiocephalic vein. The left recurrent laryngeal nerve hooks around the ligamentum arteriosum to pass upwards on the right side of the arch of the aorta, in the groove between the trachea and esophagus. The pulmonary trunk bifurcates into right and left pulmonary arteries in the concavity of the arch. On the right side of the arch lie the trachea and esophagus.</p>
<p>The adventitial layer of the arch contains baroreceptors (like the carotid sinus in the wall of the internal carotid artery - p. 438) innervated by vagal nerve fibers which pass to the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (p. 616) and which are concerned with the reflex control of the heart rate.</p>
<p>Under the arch in the region of the ligamentum arteriosum there are some very small masses of tissue, the aortic bodies (supplied by vagal fibers), which like the carotid bodies (p. 438) are concerned with respiratory reflexes, detecting hypoxia (p. 253).</p>
<p>The brachiocephalic trunk arises in or a little to the left of the midline of the body. It slopes upwards across the trachea to the back of the right sternoclavicular joint, where it divides into the right common carotid and right subclavian arteries. It has no branches apart from the rare thyroidea ima artery, which may arise from it or directly from the arch of the aorta. The termination of the left brachiocephalic vein lies in front of the artery (Fig. 4.12). The trachea is immediately behind the jugular notch at the thoracic inlet, but it slopes back and the manubrium slopes forward below this, and the brachiocephalic trunk and left brachiocephalic vein occupy the space thus provided (Fig. 4.12).</p>
<p>The left common carotid artery arises just behind the brachiocephalic trunk from the upper convexity of the aortic arch. It passes straight up alongside the trachea into the neck (Fig. 4.15). It has no branches in the mediastinum.</p>
<p>The left subclavian artery arises just behind the left common carotid; the two run upwards together. The subclavian artery arches to the left over the apex of the lung, which it deeply grooves. It leaves the left common carotid at a point directly behind the left sternoclavicular joint. It has no branches in the mediastinum.</p>

<p>This is the shriveled fibrous remnant of the ductus arteriosus of the fetus, a channel that short-circuited the lungs. It passes from the very commencement of the left pulmonary artery to the concavity of the aortic arch (Fig. 4.12), beyond the point where the left subclavian artery branches off. It lies almost horizontally. The left recurrent laryngeal nerve hooks around it. The superficial part of the cardiac plexus lies anterior to it, and the deep part on its right, in front of the left main bronchus.</p>
<p><strong>Surgical approach.</strong> The pleura over the aortic arch is incised behind the vagus nerve and upwards towards the origin of the left subclavian artery. The pleural flap is reflected forwards with the vagus and its left recurrent laryngeal branch to give sufficient access to the ductus.</p>
<h2 id="brachiocephalic-veins">
  Brachiocephalic Veins
  <a class="anchor" href="#brachiocephalic-veins">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The brachiocephalic veins (formerly called innominate) are formed behind the sternoclavicular joints by confluence of the internal jugular and subclavian veins. In the neck each internal jugular vein lies lateral to the common carotid artery, in front of scalenus anterior. The subclavian vein, running medially into the brachiocephalic, lies lateral to and then below the muscle. Medial to scalenus anterior, in front of the first part of the subclavian artery, the vein has been joined by the internal jugular vein and is thence called the brachiocephalic. This part of each brachiocephalic vein receives tributaries corresponding to the branches of the first part of the subclavian artery (vertebral, inferior thyroid, internal thoracic and, on the left side only, superior intercostal).</p>
<p>The right brachiocephalic vein commences behind the right sternoclavicular joint and runs vertically downwards; it is a persistent part of the right anterior cardinal vein of the embryo. It receives the right lymphatic duct and right jugular and subclavian lymph trunks, which normally enter independently of each other.</p>
<p>The left brachiocephalic vein passes almost horizontally behind the upper half of the manubrium across the superior mediastinum to join the right vein at the lower border of the first right costal cartilage (Fig. 4.12). It is a persistent anastomotic channel between the two anterior cardinal veins of the embryo (p. 45). In the infant the left brachiocephalic vein projects slightly above the jugular notch, and may do so in the adult if the vein is distended, especially if the head and neck are thrown back. The vein is then vulnerable to suprasternal incisions (e.g. tracheotomy). The commencement of the vein receives the thoracic duct, which often divides into two or three branches that join the vein separately. In addition to the vertebral and internal thoracic veins the left brachiocephalic vein receives most of the blood from the inferior thyroid plexus of veins. The left superior intercostal vein joins it near the midline of the body (Fig. 4.15), and a large thymic vein commonly enters nearby.</p>
<p>The thymus or its remnants and the pretracheal fascia lie in front of the vein. The fascia directs a retrosternal goiter into the space between the vein and the brachiocephalic trunk and trachea.</p>

  Superior Vena Cava

</h2>
<p>This vessel commences at the lower border of the first right costal cartilage by confluence of the two brachiocephalic veins (Figs 4.12 and 4.14). It passes vertically downwards behind the right border of the sternum and, piercing the pericardium at the level of the second costal cartilage enters the upper border of the right atrium at the lower border of the third right costal cartilage. These cartilages thus form the surface markings for the vessel. Behind the sternal angle, opposite the second right costal cartilage, it receives the azygos vein, which has arched forwards over the root of the right lung. Developmentally, the superior vena cava is formed as the persisting right anterior cardinal vein, but below the entrance of the azygos vein it represents the persisting right common cardinal vein (duct of Cuvier) of the embryo (p. 45).</p>
<h2 id="cardiac-plexus">
  Cardiac Plexus
  <a class="anchor" href="#cardiac-plexus">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The cardiac plexus consists of various sympathetic, parasympathetic and afferent fibers and is divided into superficial and deep parts, but this is merely a descriptive division and functionally they are one. Their branches enter the pericardium to accompany the coronary arteries (vasomotor) and also to reach the SA node (cardioinhibitor and cardioaccelerator), the AV node and bundle and the ventricular myocardium. These branches form the coronary and cardiac parts of the plexus. Other branches enter the lung root as the pulmonary part (pulmonary plexus) for the supply of bronchial muscle and the blood vessels of the lung.</p>
<p>The superficial part of the cardiac plexus is formed by the union of the inferior cervical cardiac branch of the left vagus and the cardiac branch of the left cervical sympathetic ganglion, i.e. by the two small autonomic nerves which cross the left side of the arch of the aorta between the phrenic and vagus nerves (p. 256). This part lies in front of the ligamentum arteriosum and becomes continuous with the deep part.</p>
<p>The deep part of the cardiac plexus is larger and receives contributions from the right vagus nerve by its upper and lower cervical cardiac branches, from the left vagus by its superior cervical cardiac branch, and a branch from each recurrent laryngeal nerve, and also sympathetic fibers from the remaining five cervical sympathetic ganglia (the middle and inferior on the left and all three on the right), and from the upper five or six thoracic sympathetic ganglia of both sides. This part lies to the right of the ligamentum arteriosum, in front of the left bronchus at the bifurcation of the pulmonary trunk. The sympathetic fibers are postganglionic from cell bodies in the cervical and upper thoracic ganglia, and the preganglionic cells are in the lateral horn of the upper five or six thoracic segments of the cord. The vagal fibers are preganglionic from cell bodies in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus but some are apparently intermingled with cells of the nucleus ambiguus. The vagal fibers relay in the heart wall, not in the cardiac plexus.</p>
<p>The vagi contain afferent fibers concerned with cardiovascular reflexes, and their cell bodies are in the inferior vagal ganglia. Pain fibers run with sympathetic nerves, reaching any of the three cervical and upper two or three thoracic sympathetic ganglia, but most go to the inferior cervical and first thoracic ganglia. The pain fibers pursue the usual pathway to the central nervous system, passing through the sympathetic ganglia to the spinal nerves via white rami communicantes (Fig. 1.22C) (hence upper thoracic sympathectomy for the relief of cardiac pain); their cell bodies are in the posterior root ganglia. The connection with cervical and thoracic spinal nerves presumably explains the referral of cardiac pain to the arm, chest or neck. Myocardial infarction may destroy afferent fibers, including those subserving pain.</p>
<h2 id="trachea">
  Trachea
  <a class="anchor" href="#trachea">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The trachea is the continuation of the larynx and commences in the neck below the cricoid cartilage at the level of C6 vertebra, 5 cm above the jugular notch. Entering the thoracic inlet in the midline (Fig. 4.12) it passes downwards and backwards behind the manubrium to bifurcate into the two principal or main bronchi (p. 284) on a level just below the lower border of the manubrium (Fig. 4.16). This is true of the recumbent cadaver, in whom the trachea is about 10 cm long and 2 cm in diameter; in the living the bifurcation may be 5 cm lower in full inspiration. The cricoid cartilage and sternal angle provide easy surface markings for the upper and lower ends of the trachea.</p>
<p>The thoracic part runs through the superior mediastinum in front of the esophagus (Figs 4.12 and 4.16) to the upper part of the posterior mediastinum. In front of this part are the manubrium with sternohyoid and sternothyroid attached on each side, the inferior thyroid and left brachiocephalic veins and the remains of the thymus. The brachiocephalic and left common carotid arteries diverge on either side. The right side of the trachea is separated from the lung by the pleura which plasters the vagus nerve against the side of the tracheal wall (Fig. 4.14), and the arch of the azygos vein hooks forwards over the right bronchus. The right brachiocephalic vein and superior vena cava are anterolateral to the trachea. On the left the left common carotid and subclavian arteries (Fig. 4.15) prevent the pleura from coming into contact with the trachea as it does on the right, and the arch of the aorta hooks backwards over the left bronchus, with the left recurrent laryngeal nerve passing upwards in the groove between trachea and esophagus.</p>
<p>The pulmonary trunk branches into the right and left pulmonary arteries rather to the left of the tracheal bifurcation, in front of the left bronchus (Fig. 4.31). Here lies the deep part of the cardiac plexus. The right pulmonary artery crosses just below the tracheal bifurcation, and between the two is part of the tracheobronchial group of lymph nodes.</p>

<h2 id="structure">
  Structure
  <a class="anchor" href="#structure">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The patency of the trachea as an airway, its essential function, is maintained by 15-20 horseshoe shaped hyaline cartilages (commonly called tracheal rings although they are never complete circles). The gaps in the rings are at the back, where there is smooth muscle, mostly transversely placed (the trachealis muscle), which here supplements the fibrous tissue of the rest of the framework. There is a high content of elastic fibers, to facilitate the necessary elastic recoil during respiration and neck movements. (In transection injury, as by the steering wheel in severe motor vehicle accidents, the distal cut end may disappear into the mediastinum due to this elasticity). The mucous membrane is of typical respiratory type, with pseudostratified columnar ciliated epithelium and goblet cells, mucous glands and scattered lymphoid nodules.</p>
<h2 id="function">
  Function
  <a class="anchor" href="#function">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The cartilaginous rings keep the airway open, mucus traps particles, cilia beat upwards to clear debris, and glandular secretion helps to humidify the passing air. During swallowing the trachea is stretched as the larynx moves upwards (the bifurcation does not move) and elasticity restores the normal position. Sudden descent of the diaphragm pulling on the bifurcation, pericardium and aortic arch produces the clinical sign of tracheal tug. The trachealis muscle controls the diameter of the tube. During coughing there is a 30% increase in transverse diameter produced by compressed air in the trachea while the vocal cords are shut, but 10% narrowing of the resting diameter at the instant the cords open. Like the choke barrel of a shotgun this greatly increases the explosive force of the blast of compressed air.</p>
<p>Arising principally from C4 in the neck, the nerve passes down over the anterior scalene muscle across the dome of the pleura behind the subclavian vein. It runs through the mediastinum in front of the lung root. Each nerve lies in the thorax as far lateral as possible, being in contact laterally with the mediastinal pleura throughout the whole of its course. Their medial relations, however, are asymmetrical. The right phrenic nerve is in contact with venous structures throughout the whole of its course (Fig. 4.14). The right brachiocephalic vein, the superior vena cava, then the right atrium, and the inferior vena cava, lie to its medial side. It reaches the under surface of the diaphragm by passing through the vena caval foramen in the central tendon.</p>
<p>The left phrenic nerve (Fig. 4.15) has the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries that arise from the arch of the aorta to its medial side. It crosses the arch lateral to the superior intercostal vein and in front of the vagus nerve, and then runs laterally down the pericardium over the left ventricle towards the apex of the heart. It reaches the under surface of the diaphragm by piercing the muscular part just to the left of the pericardium. Note that the left phrenic passes through diaphragmatic muscle but the right through tendon.</p>
<p>On the under surface of the diaphragm each phrenic nerve splits into three main branches — anterior, lateral and posterior - which radiate from the point of entry, giving off branches as they go. Each nerve is the sole motor supply to its own half of the diaphragm, including the crus. The part of the right crus that lies to the left of the esophagus is supplied by the left phrenic (because these fibers are embryologically left-sided). About two-thirds of the phrenic nerve fibers are motor; the rest are sensory to the diaphragm (except for the most peripheral parts which receive intercostal afferent fibers), and to the mediastinal pleura, the fibrous pericardium, the parietal layer of serous pericardium, and the central parts of the diaphragmatic pleura and peritoneum. The nerve also gives branches to the areolar tissue of the mediastinum but not to viscera; in a word, it is the nerve of the transverse septum. The nerve is supplied with blood by the pericardiacophrenic artery (a branch of the internal thoracic) which accompanies it, with companion veins, all the way to the diaphragm. To avoid damage to the nerve supply, incisions in the diaphragm are made as far as possible round the periphery or radiating towards the main nerve entry point.</p>
<p>Pain referred from the diaphragmatic peritoneum (C4) is classically felt in the shoulder tip (C4), but pain from thoracic surfaces supplied by the phrenic nerve (pleura, pericardium) is usually located there, albeit vaguely.</p>
<p>In their descent through the thorax the vagus nerves are, so to speak, attempting to reach the midline at all levels. Thus the right vagus (Fig. 4.14) is in contact with the trachea, while the left (Fig. 4.15) is held away from that structure by the great arteries that spring from the arch of the aorta. The left nerve crosses the arch deep to the left superior intercostal vein, and the right nerve lies on the trachea deep to the arch of the azygos vein. Each vagus passes down behind the lung root, here giving off a large contribution to the pulmonary plexuses. The nerves now pass onwards to achieve their object of reaching the midline by entering into the esophageal plexuses on the surfaces of the lower esophagus. In the plexuses they become mixed, and the right and left vagal trunks, as they leave the plexuses, contain fibers from each vagus (p. 278). On the arch of the aorta the left vagus nerve flattens out and gives off its recurrent laryngeal branch (Fig. 4.15). This nerve hooks around the ligamentum arteriosum, and, passing up on the right side of the aortic arch, ascends in the groove between trachea and esophagus. The right recurrent laryngeal nerve is given off in the root of the neck and hooks around the right subclavian artery (Fig. 4.12). From the right vagus nerve thoracic cardiac branches enter the deep part of the cardiac plexus, as do cardiac branches from both recurrent laryngeal nerves. Both the recurrent laryngeal nerves supply the whole trachea and the adjacent esophagus (i.e. above the lung roots) but are of supreme importance because of their supply to muscles of the larynx (p. 504) and relation to the thyroid gland (p. 431).</p>
<p>The esophagus lies against the vertebrae at the back of the superior mediastinum. The thoracic duct lies on its left side. Both structures pass through the posterior mediastinum; they are described on pages 277 and 279.</p>
<p>This space, little more than a potential one, lies between the pericardium and sternum. It is overlapped by the anterior edges of both lungs. It is continuous through the superior mediastinum with the pretracheal space of the neck. Its principal content is the thymus, which may lie, however, only in the anterior part of the superior mediastinum.</p>
<p>The thymus may appear to be a single organ, but in fact it consists of right and left lobes closely applied to each other for much of their extent (Fig. 4.17). It is usually most prominent in children, where it may be expected to extend from the level of the fourth costal cartilages to the lower poles of the thyroid gland. In front of it lie the pretracheal fascia, the sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles, the manubrium and upper part of the body of the sternum and their adjacent costal cartilages. The lobes are overlapped on each side by the pleura, to which the pretracheal fascia is firmly attached. Behind it are the pericardium, the arch of the aorta with its three large branches (brachiocephalic, left common carotid and left subclavian), the left brachiocephalic vein and the trachea.</p>
<p>The thymus can be distinguished from fat by being slightly different in color (pinker or browner in life), with lobules that are larger, smoother and denser than fat. The structure of the thymus is referred to on page 16.</p>
<p>Small branches enter the thymus from the inferior thyroid and internal thoracic arteries, and there are corresponding veins. Frequently a rather large thymic vein formed by tributaries from both lobes enters the left brachiocephalic vein (Fig. 4.12).</p>
<h2 id="lymph-drainage-1">
  Lymph Drainage
  <a class="anchor" href="#lymph-drainage-1">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Channels drain into parasternal, tracheobronchial and brachiocephalic nodes, but the thymus does not receive any afferent lymphatics.</p>
<p>Sympathetic fibers entering with blood vessels are presumably vasomotor, and there are vagal fibers, but the roles of nerves and of the various neuroendocrine substances that have also been described in the thymus have not yet been clarified.</p>
<p>The epithelium of the human thymus is believed to develop from the endoderm of the ventral part of the third and probably the fourth branchial pouches of both sides (hence the bilobed structure) and also from ectoderm of the corresponding branchial clefts. Some of the epithelial cells become the thymic (Hassall&rsquo;s) corpuscles; others form a network of epithelial reticular cells believed to be the source of thymic hormones concerned with the differentiation of T lymphocytes. Connective tissue elements are derived from surrounding mesoderm, but the original colonizing lymphocytes have migrated from the bone marrow. The developing thymus descends from the neck into the mediastinum in front of all the major contents. Although it regresses after puberty, the secretion of thymic hormones and its influence on lymphocytes that migrate to it continues throughout life.</p>
<p>Exposure is usually through a median sternotomy. The pretracheal fascia is the guide to the thymus, for this thin layer must be exposed by clearing away the overlying fatty tissue and then incised so that the lobes can be dissected away from the posterior surface of the fascia. Thin-walled veins and the pleura are hazards, and although more laterally placed the phrenic nerves may be at risk when clearing extrapleural fat.</p>
<p>The term middle mediastinum (like inferior mediastinum) is not frequently used. It contains the pericardium and heart (described here), the adjoining parts of the great vessels (p. 267 and 271), the lung roots (p. 283) and parts of the phrenic nerves (p. 261) that pass down between pericardium and pleura.</p>
<h2 id="pericardium">
  Pericardium
  <a class="anchor" href="#pericardium">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Do not confuse the fibrous pericardium with the serous pericardium. They are separate entities, with separate functions (p. 265).</p>
<p>This fibrous sac encloses the heart and also the roots of the great vessels, fusing with all of the vessels except the inferior vena cava (already fused with the tendon of the diaphragm). Its broad base overlies the central tendon of the diaphragm, with which it is inseparably blended. Both it and the central tendon are derived from the septum transversum, and can be regarded as one structure. The fibrous sac is connected to the upper and lower ends of the sternum by weak sternopericardial ligaments. It is supplied with blood by the pericardiacophrenic and internal thoracic arteries.</p>
<p>A layer of serosa lines the fibrous pericardium, whence it is reflected around the roots of the great vessels to cover the entire surface of the heart. Between these parietal and visceral layers there are two sinuses: the transverse sinus and the oblique sinus of the pericardium. In order to understand the presence of these two spaces, it is desirable to recall the early development of the heart (p. 44). The heart first appears as a vascular tube lying free in a space, the pericardial cavity, within the transverse septum. The heart tube is suspended from the dorsal wall of this cavity by a dorsal mesocardium, a simple mesentery consisting of two layers of serous pericardium reflected around the tube from the lining of the cavity (Fig. 4.18A). The arterial and venous ends of the tube are thus each surrounded by a simple sleeve of visceral pericardium. No matter how many vessels may be derived from either end of this tube, they must all continue to be enclosed together in this single tube of serous pericardium. In fact, the arterial end splits into two, the aorta and the pulmonary trunk, while the venous end splits into six veins, the four pulmonary veins and the superior and inferior venae cavae. With elongation, bending and rotation of the heart tube (Fig. 4.18C), the two arteries and the six veins pierce the adult pericardium in a pattern that can best be appreciated by study of the interior of the pericardium after the heart has been removed (Fig. 4.18D). It will be seen that the oblique sinus of the pericardium is no more than a cul-de-sac between the two left and two right pulmonary veins and the inferior vena cava. Its anterior wall is formed by the posterior wall of the left atrium, between the four pulmonary veins. The presence of the transverse sinus is due to the fact that the dorsal mesocardium breaks down, thus producing a communication from right to left and dorsal to the heart tube, between its arterial and venous ends (Fig. 4.18B). The transverse and oblique sinuses are separated from each other by a double fold of serous pericardium. A finger in the transverse sinus will pass across the pericardial cavity behind both aorta and pulmonary trunk, but in front of the superior vena cava on the right side, and the left auricle on the left. It is through the transverse sinus that a temporary ligature is passed to occlude pulmonary trunk and aorta during pulmonary embolectomy and other cardiac operations.</p>
<h2 id="nerve-supply-3">
  Nerve Supply
  <a class="anchor" href="#nerve-supply-3">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The fibrous pericardium is supplied by the phrenic nerve. The parietal layer of serous pericardium that lines it is similarly innervated, but the visceral layer on the heart surface is insensitive. Pain from the heart (angina) originates in the muscle or the vessels and is transmitted by sympathetic nerves (p. 259). The pain of pericarditis originates in the parietal layer only, and is transmitted by the phrenic nerve.</p>
<p>The fibrous sac provides slippery surfaces for the heart to beat inside and the lungs to move outside. Apart from the passage of the great vessels, all inner surfaces are slippery; the oblique sinus permits pulsation of the left atrium (a kind of cardiac bursa like the omental bursa-lesser sac-behind the stomach). Apart from the bare area in front (from the midline halfway to the apex beat) and a bare strip posteriorly for the esophagus, the whole of the outer surface of the fibrous sac is clothed with densely adherent parietal pleura, on which the breathing lungs glide.</p>
<p>The needle is inserted in the angle between the xiphoid process and the left seventh costal cartilage at the costal margin, and directed upwards, backwards and slightly medially through the central tendon of the diaphragm into the pericardial cavity. The pleura and lung should be too far lateral to be damaged. For more prolonged drainage through an indwelling tube, the left fifth costal cartilage is resected and the cavity opened through the bed of the cartilage after dividing the internal thoracic vessels.</p>
<h2 id="heart">
  Heart
  <a class="anchor" href="#heart">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The heart is the muscular pump responsible for blood circulation. It is an organ with four chambers - right and left atria, right and left ventricles - and, as seen from the front, is described as having right, inferior and left borders, an anterior or sternocostal surface, an inferior or diaphragmatic surface, a base or posterior surface, and an apex.</p>
<h2 id="position">
  Position
  <a class="anchor" href="#position">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Hold a heart in the position it occupies in the body and look at it from the front (Fig. 4.19). The right border consists entirely of the right atrium. The inferior border is made up mostly of right ventricle with a small portion of left ventricle, which itself forms the apex, at the junction of the inferior and left borders. The left border is mostly left ventricle, with the auricle of the left atrium forming the uppermost part of this border. The anterior or sternocostal surface consists of the right atrium, the vertical atrioventricular groove, and the right ventricle, with a narrow strip of the left ventricle appearing on the horizon of the left border. The tip of the left auricular appendage peeps over this border. Now look at the heart from behind and below. The inferior, or diaphragmatic surface (Fig. 4.20) consists of the right atrium receiving the inferior vena cava, the anteroposterior atrioventricular groove and to the left of this the ventricular surface is made up of one-third right ventricle and two-thirds left ventricle, separated by the posterior interventricular branch of the right coronary artery. The left atrium is attached behind the right atrium, but at a higher level; it does not extend down to the diaphragmatic surface. The posterior surface (or base) of the heart (Fig. 4.21) consists almost entirely of the left atrium, receiving the four pulmonary veins. From it the left ventricle converges to the left towards the apex. To the right a narrow strip of right atrium forms the horizon, while below a small part of the posterior wall of the right atrium receives the coronary sinus.</p>
<p>During descent of the central tendon of the diaphragm in full inspiration the apex of the heart descends more than the relatively fixed base, and the heart occupies a somewhat more vertical position (Fig. 4.10). In full expiration the ascent of the diaphragm forces the heart into the more horizontal position characteristic of the cadaver (Fig. 4.9), but these differences in position are not very great.</p>
<p>Note that the base of the heart is the posterior surface (left atrium), and not the area from which the great vessels emerge at the top of the heart and which has no special name.</p>
<p>The right border of the heart extends from the lower border of the right third costal cartilage to the lower border of the right sixth costal cartilage, just beyond the right margin of the sternum and describing a slight convex curve between these points. The inferior border passes from the right sixth costal cartilage to the apex, which is normally in the left fifth intercostal space about 9 cm (3½ in) from the midline. From the apex the left border extends upwards to the lower border of the left second costal cartilage about 2 cm (¾ in) from the sternal margin. These are the borders as seen in a typical radiograph of the normal heart, although the area of cardiac dullness as determined by percussion will be smaller. The apex beat is slightly medial to the surface projection of the apex.</p>
<p>The airway and breathing aspects of CPR have been mentioned on page 254. For restoring circulation, a blow to the lower part of the sternum (precordial thump) with the side of a clenched fist may restore normal beating in circulatory arrest, but usually external cardiac massage is required. With the operator at the side of the supine patient, the heel of one hand is placed over the lower end of the sternum above the xiphisternum, and the heel of the other hand placed over the first. With the elbows straight, the sternum is rhythmically compressed backwards for 4-5 cm about 60 times a minute, so squeezing the ventricles between the sternum and the vertebral column and stimulating the return of blood circulation.</p>
<h2 id="fibrous-skeleton">
  Fibrous Skeleton
  <a class="anchor" href="#fibrous-skeleton">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The two atria and the two ventricles are attached to a pair of conjoined fibrous rings which, in the form of a figure 8, bound the atrioventricular orifices. The figure 8 lies on its side, very nearly in the sagittal plane. (A small bone, the os cordis, lies at the junction of the two rings in some animals). To this fibrous skeleton the muscle of the heart is attached; the muscle fibers encircle the chambers of the heart in a series of whorls and spirals. The atria lie to the right and the ventricles to the left of the fibrous skeleton and there is no muscular continuity between the two. The atrioventricular conducting bundle is the only physiological connection between atria and ventricles across the fibrous ring. The membranous part of the interventricular septum is attached to the fibrous skeleton, and so are the bases of the cusps of the tricuspid and mitral valves (Fig. 4.23).</p>
<p>Clinically the heart is described as consisting of right and left sides. The right side propels blood to the lungs and the left side propels blood around the systemic circulation; separate failure of either side produces a chain of symptoms peculiar to itself. Anatomically, however, it should be noted that the right side lies much more in front of than to the right of the left side, for the interatrial and interventricular septa lie almost in the coronal plane (Fig. 4.22).</p>
<p>The four chambers of the heart, the two atria and the two ventricles, possess anatomical features that will now be considered, in the order in which the circulating blood flows through them.</p>
<p>This elongated chamber lies between the superior and inferior venae cavae, and forms the right border of the heart (Fig. 4.19). Its lower end is almost completely occupied by the orifice for the inferior vena cava but its upper end is prolonged to the left of the superior vena cava as the right auricle. This overlies the commencement of the aorta and the upper part of the right atrioventricular groove and, with the left auricle, it clasps the infundibulum (upper end) of the right ventricle. The left atrium lies behind the right atrium. From the angle between the superior vena cava and the right auricle a shallow groove sometimes descends; this is the sulcus terminalis. It is produced, when present, by the projection into the cavity of the right atrium of a vertical ridge of heart muscle, the crista terminalis. The interior of the right atrium is smooth to the right of the crista terminalis, but between the crista and the blind extremity of the auricle the myocardium is projected into a series of horizontal ridges like the teeth of a comb: the pectinate muscles (Fig. 4.22). This rough area represents the true auricular chamber of the embryonic heart. The remainder of the atrial cavity, smooth walled, is produced by incorporation of the right horn of the sinus venosus (p. 275).</p>
<p>The opening of the inferior vena cava is guarded by a ridge, the remains of the valve of the inferior vena cava, that is continued upwards towards the opening of the coronary sinus. This opening lies above the septal cusp of the tricuspid valve, and to the left of the inferior vena caval orifice. It is big enough to admit the tip of the little finger of the owner of the heart (big man, big heart, big little finger).</p>
<p>The interatrial septum forms the posterior wall of the right atrium above the opening of the coronary sinus. Towards its lower part is a shallow saucer shaped depression, the fossa ovalis. This is the primary septum of the fetal heart. The crescentic upper margin of the fossa ovalis is called the limbus, and indicates the lower edge of the secondary septum. Failure of fusion of the two septa gives rise to a persistent foramen ovale (p. 275).</p>
<p>This chamber projects to the left of the right atrium (Figs 4.19 and 4.22). The atrioventricular groove between the two is vertical over the front of the heart and anteroposterior on the inferior surface. It lodges the right coronary artery and is usually filled with fat. The right ventricle narrows as it passes upwards towards the commencement of the pulmonary trunk.</p>
<p>The interior of the cavity (Fig. 4.22), whose walls are much thicker than those of the atrium, is thrown into a series of muscular ridges and bundles, the trabeculae carneae. One of these ridges has broken free and lies in the cavity attached by its two ends to the interventricular septum and the anterior papillary muscle. This is the septomarginal trabecula (formerly the moderator band (Fig. 4.22); it contains part of the right branch of the conducting bundle. Other bundles or bridges of muscle break free from the ventricular wall to form the papillary muscles which are attached to the cusps of the tricuspid valve.</p>
<p>The tricuspid valve guards the right atrioventricular orifice. It has three cusps and admits the tips of three fingers (the mitral valve has two cusps and admits two fingers). The three cusps, called anterior, posterior and septal, are attached by their bases to the fibrous atrioventricular ring and are arranged to lie against the three walls of the ventricle - anterior, inferior and septal. Note that the posterior cusp lies against the inferior wall or floor of the ventricle (Fig. 4.22); it is called posterior because it is behind the anterior cusp, but would be better called the inferior cusp. The cusps (leaflets) of both the tricuspid and mitral valves are more variable in size and shape than most textbooks suggest, and often appear to be subdivided but without forming complete additional leaflets. The edges and ventricular surfaces of the cusps receive the attachments of the chordae tendineae, inelastic cords which diverge from the papillary muscles and prevent the cusps from being everted when the ventricle contracts. Usually the large anterior papillary muscle is connected by chordae to the anterior and posterior cusps, a smaller posterior papillary muscle is attached to the posterior and septal cusps, and several small papillary muscles join the septal and anterior cusps.</p>
<p>The cavity of the right ventricle is flattened by the forward bulge of the interventricular septum. Thus the anterior wall and septum are of equal area, while the inferior wall (floor) is much narrower. The posterior.</p>
<p>A fibrous ring at the top of the infundibulum gives attachment to the cusps of the pulmonary valve, at the commencement of the pulmonary trunk (p. 271). It is guarded by three semilunar cusps named anterior, left and right (see the caption for Fig. 4.23 and p. 276). The pulmonary orifice lies almost in the horizontal plane and is at a higher level than the aortic orifice.</p>
<h2 id="left-atrium">
  Left Atrium
  <a class="anchor" href="#left-atrium">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The left atrium forms the posterior surface (base) of the heart, and lies behind the right atrium (Fig. 4.21), the interatrial septum forming the common boundary wall. The inferior margin of the left atrium lies a little above that of the right atrium, whose posterior wall here receives the coronary sinus. From the left atrium the left ventricle slopes away to the apex. It has a small auricle that projects from its upper border and passes to the left over the atrioventricular groove and peeps around the convexity of the left side of the infundibulum (Fig. 4.19). The four pulmonary veins enter it symmetrically, one above the other on each side. They are enclosed, with the superior and inferior venae cavae, in a common sleeve of serous pericardium (Fig. 4.21). The posterior surface of the left atrium between the pulmonary veins forms the anterior wall of the oblique sinus of the pericardium. The fibrous pericardium separates this surface from the esophagus.</p>
<p>The cavity of the left atrium is smooth walled except in the auricle; here muscular ridges indicate that the appendage was the original auricular chamber of the embryonic heart. All the smooth walled portion is derived by incorporation of the embryonic pulmonary veins into the atrial cavity. In the embryo two veins from each lung unite to form the right and left pulmonary veins which open by a common pulmonary vein into the left auricle (p. 276). The common pulmonary vein and the right and left pulmonary veins dilate and are incorporated into the wall of the atrium, which thus receives four separate veins. Should this process be arrested during embryonic development, the atrium may receive three, two, or only one pulmonary vein. Three veins in place of the usual four are fairly commonly found, but two or only one are almost unknown except in abortions, because they are accompanied by other defects of cardiac development incompatible with life.</p>
<p>The bicuspid mitral valve admits the tips of two fingers (the tricuspid valve, with three cusps, admits the tips of three fingers). The cusps are named anterior and posterior (Fig. 4.23). The anterior cusp lies between the mitral and the aortic orifices. The bases of the cusps are attached to the margins of the fibrous atrioventricular ring. Usually the attachments of the two cusps are continuous around the orifice, but sometimes they fail to meet and a small accessory cusp fills the gap between them. The mitral cusps are smaller in area and thicker than those of the tricuspid valve and consequently are not ballooned back so much into the atrium during ventricular systole. The anterior cusp of the mitral valve is thicker and more rigid than the posterior cusp.</p>
<h2 id="left-ventricle">
  Left Ventricle
  <a class="anchor" href="#left-ventricle">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The walls of this cavity are three times as thick as those of the right ventricle (Fig. 4.24). The interventricular septum (see below) bulges into the cavity of the right ventricle, so that in cross section the left ventricle is circular, the right crescentic. Trabeculae carneae are well developed. There are two papillary muscles, anterior and posterior, the anterior being the larger. Both are connected by chordae tendineae to each valve cusp (Fig. 4.25). The posterior cusp receives the chordae on both its margin and its ventricular surface, but since blood is squirted across both surfaces of the anterior cusp (down through the mitral orifice and up to the aortic) the chordae are attached to it only along its margins. The upper and right end of the septal wall is smooth; between the smooth part and the anterior cusp of the mitral valve is the aortic vestibule, which leads up to the aortic orifice.</p>
<p>Open a heart and place the left index finger in the aortic vestibule, its tip passing through the aortic valve. Anterior to the finger is the interventricular septum tapering down abruptly to the membranous part. Posterior is the anterior cusp of the mitral valve. Now pass the right index finger from the left atrium into the left ventricle. The two index fingers lie touching, pointing in opposite directions; only the anterior cusp of the mitral valve separates them. This is the pathway of the blood stream.</p>
<p>The interventricular septum lies vertically from side to side across the body: the cavity of the right ventricle lies in front of it and that of the left ventricle behind it. It is marked on the surface of the heart by the interventricular branches of right and left coronary arteries. Its muscle wall, equal in thickness to that of the left ventricle, bulges forward into the cavity of the right ventricle. At its attachment to the fibrous skeleton (conjoined atrioventricular rings) it is thinner and more fibrous. This is the membranous part of the septum, and the aortic vestibule lies between it and the anterior cusp of the mitral valve (Figs 4.23 and 4.25).</p>
<p>The aortic orifice is guarded by the aortic valve, at the entrance to the ascending aorta. It lies at a lower level than the pulmonary orifice, rather to its right side (Fig. 4.23), and is more obliquely placed. Its three semilunar cusps are named right, left and posterior (in contrast to the anterior, right and left cusps of the pulmonary valve; see the caption for Figure 4.23 and p. 276).</p>
<h2 id="structure-of-heart-valves">
  Structure of Heart Valves
  <a class="anchor" href="#structure-of-heart-valves">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The cusps of the tricuspid and mitral valves are all similar. They are flat and their free edges are serrated in outline by the attachment of the chordae tendineae. On closure of the valves during ventricular systole the cusps do not merely meet edge to edge, but come into mutual contact along strips of their auricular surfaces near the serrated margins. This contact and the pull of the marginal chordae prevent eversion of the free edges into the cavity of the atrium, and the centrally attached chordae limit the amount of ballooning of the cusps towards the atrium. The tricuspid and mitral valves are kept competent by active contraction of the papillary muscles, which pull on the chordae during ventricular systole. The chordae tendineae also act, as it were, in reverse, helping to prevent ventricular stretching.</p>
<p>The cusps of the pulmonary and aortic valves are similar to each other. The free edge of each cusp contains a central fibrous nodule from each side of which straight edges slope at 120° from each other to the attached base of the cusp. Three cusps lying edge to edge thus close the circular orifice. The cusps are cup shaped, and from their free and attached (scalloped) margins they bulge down in a globular convexity towards the cavity of the ventricle. During ventricular systole the bulge of the sinuses above the cusps prevents the cusps from becoming flattened against the walls of the sinuses; the residual blood in the sinuses forms vortices which help the elastic recoil of the cusps at the end of systole. During ventricular diastole pressure of blood above the valves distends the cusps, so that their free edges are forced together. Competence of the pulmonary and aortic valves is thus a passive phenomenon, the result of mutual pressure between the distended cusps, and depending on the integrity of their straight edges.</p>
<p>Microscopically the valves of the heart are composed of fibrous tissue in which many elastic fibers are found. They are covered on each surface by vascular endothelium.</p>
<h2 id="surface-markings-of-valves">
  Surface Markings of Valves
  <a class="anchor" href="#surface-markings-of-valves">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The surface markings of the heart itself have been considered on page 266. As far as the valves are concerned, they all lie behind the sternum, making a line with each other that is nearly vertical (Fig. 4.26). The bases of tricuspid and mitral valves, attached to the atrioventricular ring, are indicated by vertical lines over the lower part of the sternum. The tricuspid valve lies behind the midline of the lower sternum, the mitral valve, overlapping it, lies higher and somewhat to the left. The aortic and pulmonary orifices lie behind the left border of the sternum at the third costal cartilage; the pulmonary is the higher of the two.</p>
<p>Knowledge of the surface markings of the heart valves has little application in auscultation of the heart. The normal heart sounds are produced by closure of heart valves, and the opening snap of the mitral valve may also be audible, but these sounds are by no means heard best directly over the valves concerned. They are heard best (Fig. 4.26) where the blood-containing chambers lie nearest to the chest wall. For the tricuspid valve this is over its surface, but for the mitral valve it is at the apex beat, where the cavity of the left ventricle lies nearest the surface. For the aortic valve it is where the ascending aorta lies nearest the surface, at the right sternal margin in the second intercostal space. For the pulmonary valve it is at the left sternal margin at the third costal cartilage (over the infundibulum of the right ventricle).</p>
<h2 id="great-vessels">
  Great Vessels
  <a class="anchor" href="#great-vessels">#</a>
</h2>
<p>In their course through the pericardial cavity the great vessels are invested with a reflection of serous pericardium between the parietal and visceral layers. The ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk share a common sleeve of serous pericardium in which they lie completely free in front of the transverse sinus (Fig. 4.21). The pulmonary trunk inside the fibrous pericardium measures 4 cm while the ascending aorta is slightly longer.</p>
<p>The six veins share another common sleeve of serous pericardium (Fig. 4.21). The four pulmonary veins (described on p. 269) and the inferior vena cava (p. 263) are all 1 cm (½ in) or less in length within the pericardium, but the superior vena cava (p. 259) courses for about three times that distance through the pericardial cavity before entering the right atrium.</p>
<h2 id="ascending-aorta">
  Ascending Aorta
  <a class="anchor" href="#ascending-aorta">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Immediately above the aortic orifice the wall of the ascending aorta bulges to make the aortic sinuses, one above each cusp and similarly named. From the right sinus the right coronary artery emerges; from the left sinus, the left coronary artery. Above the sinuses the aorta runs to the right of the pulmonary trunk and as it passes upwards it slants a little forward towards the manubrium before curving backwards at the commencement of the arch. Here the fibrous pericardium is blended with its wall. The ascending aorta, over 5 cm (2 in) long, makes a gentle spiral with the pulmonary trunk on its left side (Fig. 4.19), both within the common sleeve of serous pericardium. The branches of the ascending aorta are the coronary arteries, described on page 273.</p>
<h2 id="pulmonary-trunk">
  Pulmonary Trunk
  <a class="anchor" href="#pulmonary-trunk">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Commencing at the pulmonary orifice, which is at a slightly higher level than the aortic orifice (Fig. 4.26), the wide pulmonary trunk arches backwards to the left of the ascending aorta, the two vessels making the gentle spiral enclosed in the common sleeve of serous pericardium in front of the transverse sinus (Fig. 4.21). The trunk passes backwards and emerges from the fibrous pericardium to divide in the concavity of the aortic arch and in front of the left main bronchus (Fig. 4.31) into the right and left pulmonary arteries, which enter the lung roots with their corresponding bronchi (p. 283). The trunk is about 5 cm (2 in) long and most of it lies within the pericardial cavity. Note that the proper name for this vessel is the pulmonary trunk, not the pulmonary artery; the pulmonary trunk divides into the right pulmonary artery and the left pulmonary artery.</p>
<p><strong>Catheterization.</strong> Various aspects of cardiorespiratory function can be monitored by pulmonary artery catheterization. The catheters are introduced into the right atrium, usually via the internal jugular or subclavian veins (p. 439 and 442) and carried on through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle and pulmonary trunk, and then into the right pulmonary artery.</p>
<h2 id="conducting-conduction-system">
  Conducting (Conduction) System
  <a class="anchor" href="#conducting-conduction-system">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The conducting system is usually considered to consist anatomically of two main components: (1) the sinuatrial node (SA node), and (2) the atrioventricular node (AV node), the atrioventricular bundle (of His), the right and left limbs or branches of the bundle, and the subendocardial Purkinje fibers. From the SA node, which, like the AV node and its extensions, is composed of a specialized type of cardiac muscle fibers (not nervous tissue), impulses are conducted to the AV node by atrial cardiac muscle fibers. Many authorities consider that a third component of the system, the internodal tracts, forms preferential pathways for conduction between the nodes, with a rate of impulse transmission twice as fast as through ordinary atrial muscle. While these tracts can be demonstrated physiologically, there has been no agreement that they can be defined anatomically. The AV node, bundle, branches and subendocardial fibers form one continuous mass of conducting tissue; the node is really just the name given to the proximal end of the bundle.</p>
<h2 id="sinuatrial-node">
  Sinuatrial Node
  <a class="anchor" href="#sinuatrial-node">#</a>
</h2>
<p>This mass of tissue, the pacemaker of the heart, is usually crescent shaped and situated within the muscle fibers of the right atrium just below the superior vena cava near the top of the crista terminalis (Fig. 4.27), and passing back and to the left into the wall of the right auricle for 1-2 cm. It is about 5 mm thick at its widest part. Rarely it becomes more horseshoe shaped, continuing into the posterior part of the auricle and atrium. The node contains the central stellate cells - pacemaker or P cells - which generate the impulses for contraction; they contain fewer myofilaments than ordinary cardiac muscle cells.</p>
<p>The AV node is buried in the muscle of the interatrial septum, above and to the left of the opening of the coronary sinus. More precisely it lies deep to Koch&rsquo;s triangle (the surgical landmark for the node), a small area bounded by the base of the septal cusp of the tricuspid valve, the anteromedial margin of the opening of the coronary sinus, and a palpable collagenous band (the tendon of Todaro) 1 mm in diameter running from the right fibrous trigone to the medial edge of the valve of the inferior vena cava. From the node, the AV bundle runs upwards in the right fibrous trigone beneath the attachment of the septal cusp and then along the inferior border of the membranous part of the interventricular septum, where it divides into right and left branches. Because the fibrous framework of the heart separates the muscles of the atria from those of the ventricles, the bundle is the only means of conducting the contractile impulse from atria to ventricles. The right branch runs at first within the muscle of the septum and then becomes subendocardial on the right side of the septum. Much of it continues into the septomarginal trabecula (moderator band) to reach the anterior papillary muscle and the anterior wall of the ventricle, and its Purkinje fibers then spread out beneath the endocardium. The left branch reaches the septal endocardium of the left ventricle and rapidly breaks up into a sheaf of branches which spread out subendocardially over the septum and the rest of the ventricular wall.</p>
<p><strong>Right coronary artery.</strong> Arising from the right aortic sinus the artery passes between the right auricle and the infundibulum of the right ventricle (Fig. 4.28). Passing now vertically downwards in the atrioventricular groove the artery turns backwards at the inferior border of the heart and runs posteriorly. It gives off branches to both atrium and ventricle as it passes vertically downwards. One of the highest branches is the conus artery which passes upwards and medially on the front of the conus part (infundibulum) of the right ventricle. The largest atrial branch, arising from the first centimeter or two of the main vessel, is usually the SA nodal artery which forms a vascular ring in the right atrium and auricle below the superior vena caval opening. It supplies the SA node in about 60% of hearts (below), and may arise directly from the anterior aortic sinus adjacent to the right coronary itself, in which case this sinus has two openings. At the inferior border the right marginal artery passes to the left along the right ventricle, although it often has a much higher origin and passes obliquely down over the front of the ventricle. Posteriorly at the top of a characteristic upward kink is the origin of the AV nodal artery. On the diaphragmatic surface of the heart the posterior interventricular branch is given off. This large vessel passes along the interventricular groove towards the apex of the heart. Its name of posterior interventricular artery is a misnomer; inferior would seem more appropriate, though it is often called by clinicians the posterior descending artery. The part of the right coronary artery now remaining is much smaller than its interventricular branch. It passes backwards to anastomose by terminal arterioles with the termination of the circumflex branch of the left coronary artery at the lower part of the left atrium (Fig. 4.20).</p>
<p><strong>Left coronary artery.</strong> Arising from the left aortic sinus behind the pulmonary trunk (from which it may have an anomalous origin) the vessel emerges between the left auricle and the infundibulum of the right ventricle. After this short course it divides into its two main branches. The circumflex branch, which is really the continuation of the parent trunk but with a change of name, continues down to the back of the heart in the atrioventricular groove, giving off various ventricular branches and anastomosing with the end of the right coronary. In the first few millimeters of its course in 40% of hearts it gives off the SA nodal artery which passes to the right behind the ascending aorta and above the upper left pulmonary vein to reach the right atrium and auricle. The anterior interventricular artery, which is the cardiac vessel most often affected by disease and frequently called by clinicians the left anterior descending artery, runs down in the interventricular groove to anastomose under the apex with the posterior interventricular branch of the right coronary. It usually gives off towards the left several large ventricular branches (called by radiologists diagonal and obtuse marginal vessels), but near its origin there is a conus branch that runs on to the upper part of the right ventricle, providing a potential anastomosis with the conus branch of the right coronary.</p>
<p>The above standard description must be modified by stating that there is considerable variation in the way the major branches end and anastomose (particularly the interventricular vessels) and in the areas supplied by each vessel. In about 10% of hearts the right coronary is shorter than usual and the posterior interventricular artery is given off by a large anterior interventricular from the left coronary; in this case the heart is said to show left dominance. In the more common right dominance the posterior interventricular comes from the right coronary; the artery giving off the posterior interventricular branch is defined as the dominant artery. Most of the interventricular septum is usually supplied by penetrating septal branches from the anterior interventricular, with only a small posterior part by the posterior interventricular. The AV node and bundle and the first few millimeters of the branches receive their supply from the AV nodal artery (right coronary), but more distally the anterior interventricular (left coronary) takes over. It has already been mentioned that the SA nodal artery arises from the right coronary in about 60% of hearts and from the circumflex branch of the left coronary in the remainder.</p>
<p><strong>Anastomoses of the coronary arteries.</strong> Anastomoses exist at the arteriolar level between the terminations of the right and left coronary arteries in the atrioventricular groove and between their interventricular and conus branches. These anastomoses on the surface of the heart are insignificant. In the interventricular septum and in the posterior wall of the left ventricle there are very free anastomoses between the interventricular arteries, but still by arterioles only. The time factor in occlusion is all important; in slow occlusion there is time for healthy arterioles to open up, in abrupt occlusion there is not.</p>
<p>Potential anastomoses exist between the coronary arteries and pericardial arteries around the roots of the great vessels. These pericardial arteries are derived from the pericardiacophrenic, the bronchial and the internal thoracic arteries. In very rare instances one of these may open up to replace a coronary artery.</p>
<p><strong>Veins of the heart.</strong> The veins of the heart (Fig. 4.29) fall into three groups: the venae cordis minimae, the anterior cardiac veins, and the coronary sinus with its five normal tributaries - the great, middle and small cardiac veins, the posterior vein of the left ventricle and the oblique vein of the left atrium. The coronary sinus receives almost all of the heart&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<p>The coronary sinus lies in the posterior part of the atrioventricular groove (Fig. 4.21), covered by a thin layer of myocardium, and opens at its right (lower) end into the posterior wall of the right atrium to the left of the inferior vena caval opening. Embryologically it may be said to commence at a valve alongside the entrance of the oblique vein (of Marshall) of the left atrium (p. 275). It is a wide-bored vessel about 3 cm (1½ in) long, with the so-called valve of the coronary sinus (below) at its opening. The great cardiac vein (Fig. 4.29) accompanies the anterior interventricular and circumflex arteries to enter the upper (left) end of the sinus, receiving in its course a number of left ventricular tributaries. The middle cardiac vein accompanies the posterior interventricular artery and opens near the termination of the coronary sinus. The small cardiac vein accompanies the marginal branch of the right coronary artery (if that vessel really is at the lower margin of the heart) and is usually said to open into the lower end of the coronary sinus. However, it frequently drains directly into the right atrium through its anterior wall, in which case the vein can be said merely to be the lowest anterior cardiac vein. The posterior vein of the left ventricle joins the sinus to the left of the middle cardiac vein, and the small oblique vein of the left atrium runs downwards into the left end of the sinus.</p>
<p>The anterior cardiac veins are a series of parallel veins that run across the surface of the right ventricle to open into the right atrium (Fig. 4.29). They drain independently into the right atrium by dipping into the anterior atrioventricular groove. In this vertical groove it is common to find a vein (lying at right angles to the anterior cardiac veins) which receives two or more of the veins and itself opens into the right atrium.</p>
<p>The venae cordis minimae are small veins in the walls of all four chambers of the heart that open directly into the respective chambers. They appear to be most frequent in the right atrium; their numbers have been exaggerated in the past, and their contribution to venous return is negligible.</p>
<p>The lymphatics of the heart drain back along the coronary arteries, emerge from the fibrous pericardium along with the aorta and pulmonary trunk, and empty into the tracheobronchial lymph nodes and mediastinal lymph trunks.</p>
<p>The heart is innervated by the cardiac plexus, which has been described on page 259 together with the pathways for cardiac pain. There are baroreceptors in the wall of the aortic arch (p. 256) and in the carotid sinus (p. 438) for the reflex control of heart rate.</p>
<p>The earliest stages of cardiac development have been mentioned on page 44. Now that the adult heart has been described, some further details of development can be added.</p>
<p>The original single atrium becomes partitioned by the formation of two septa. The primary septum (septum primum) grows down towards the endocardial cushions at the atrioventricular orifice but does not immediately fuse with them; the gap remaining above the cushions is the primary foramen (foramen primum). Before this foramen becomes obliterated by further downgrowth of the septum, a new foramen (secondary foramen, foramen secundum) appears in the upper part of the primary septum. The right and left parts of the atrium thus still remain in communication. Now a further septum appears (secondary septum, septum secundum), on the right of the primary septum. It does not grow down as far as the cushions but ends at a curved posteroinferior border. The gap under the secondary septum which leads through to the secondary foramen in the primary septum is the foramen ovale, allowing fetal blood to flow from one side to the other. At birth when the lungs begin to function (p. 46), the pressure in the left atrium increases, forcing the two septa together so that they fuse, making a complete interatrial septum. The lower edge of the secondary septum remains as the limbus of the fossa ovalis; the floor of the fossa is the part of the primary septum not overlapped by the secondary septum. Note that the secondary foramen belongs to the primary septum, not the secondary septum.</p>
<p>The sinus venosus opens into the right atrium by a vertical opening (to the right of the secondary septum) guarded by flaps of tissue, the right and left venous valves (which in appearance resemble the lips of the ileocecal valve). The upper ends of the valves fuse together forming a small ridge (the septum spurium). The rest of the left venous valve fuses with the interatrial septum. The septum spurium and the upper part of the right venous valve persist as the crista terminalis, and the lower part becomes the valve of the inferior vena cava and the valve of the coronary sinus. These two veins have come to open into the right atrium because the part of the sinus venosus into which they originally opened (the right horn) has become incorporated into the wall of the atrium, forming its smooth part; the rough part with the pectinate muscles (which includes the auricle) represents the original atrium. The rest of the sinus venosus persists as the coronary sinus, with the left horn being represented by the oblique vein of the left atrium (vein of Marshall).</p>
<p>The left atrium incorporates the ends of the pulmonary veins to such an extent that only the auricle represents the original atrium.</p>
<p>The channel between the original atrium and ventricle (atrioventricular canal) becomes constricted by internal dorsal and ventral swellings, the endocardial cushions, and these meet to convert what was a single passage into the two atrioventricular orifices. Subendocardial tissue at these sites produces the mitral and tricuspid valves.</p>
<p>In the floor of the original ventricle, a partition grows upwards to become the muscular part of the interventricular septum. However, it does not grow as far as the endocardial cushions, but leaves a gap (interventricular foramen), which will become filled in by the fibrous part of the septum. It is important to appreciate that the muscular part of the septum does not grow up in the middle of the primitive ventricle but really at the junction of the ventricle and the bulb, so that the original ventricle becomes the left ventricle and the adjacent part of the bulb becomes the rough (trabecular) part of the right ventricle. The distal part of the bulb forms the smooth (outflow) part of the right ventricle, which continues upwards into the part of the bulb called the truncus arteriosus. This becomes divided into two by internal swellings, the right and left bulbar ridges, which meet to form the aorticopulmonary septum, so that the single tube becomes the ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk. The bulbar ridges are not vertical but assume a spiral form, possibly because of the pattern of blood flow, hence the way the aorta and pulmonary trunk curl round one another. It is the fusion of the lower ends of the bulbar ridges with the posterior endocardial cushion which creates the fibrous part of the interventricular septum.</p>
<p><strong>Congenital defects.</strong> Among the commoner congenital defects of cardiac development are malformations of the interatrial and interventricular septa, and Fallot&rsquo;s tetralogy. Defects of the interatrial septum range from pinholes of no significance to large gaps due to failure of closure of the foramen ovale or associated maldevelopment of the primary or secondary septa. Interventricular septal defects are commonly in the fibrous part. Fallot&rsquo;s tetralogy is due to unequal division of the truncus arteriosus, giving a small pulmonary trunk and a large ascending aorta, and hence the tetrad of (1) pulmonary stenosis, (2) right ventricular hypertrophy, (3) a defect of the fibrous part of the interventricular septum, and (4) an over-riding aorta (sitting astride both ventricles because of the septal defect).</p>
<p>Other anomalies, such as patent ductus arteriosus and coarctation of the aorta, although commonly classified as cardiac defects, are strictly speaking anomalies of the great vessels, and are considered on page 40.</p>

  Surgical Approach
  <a class="anchor" href="#surgical-approach">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Many operations on the heart are carried out through a median sternotomy (p. 254), although some require a left thoracotomy. In the former, after splitting the sternum and dividing the thymus into its two lobes, the pericardium is incised in the lines of an inverted T, with the vertical incision extending as high as the pericardial reflection from the aorta and the transverse incisions along the reflections from the diaphragm. For cardiopulmonary bypass (to keep the circulation going during open heart surgery), the superior and inferior venae cavae are cannulated through the wall of the right atrium, in order to deliver blood to the oxygenating machine. The oxygenated blood is delivered to the aorta through a cannula in the aortic arch proximal to the brachiocephalic trunk. Some of this blood will pass downwards into the ascending aorta and so perfuse the coronary vessels whose openings are just above the aortic valves (kept closed by the pressure of the incoming blood).</p>
<p>In earlier coronary artery bypass operations, a suitable length of great saphenous vein was anastomosed at one end to the ascending aorta and at the other to the appropriate coronary vessel distal to the site of blockage. The vein, of course, must be turned upside down so that any valves in the chosen segment do not obstruct the arterial flow. Current opinion now often favors the use of the internal thoracic artery; the proximal end remains intact at its subclavian origin and the cut lower end is anastomosed to the coronary vessel.</p>
<p>For the repair of atrial septal defects, the right atrium is incised along its right border, avoiding the region of the SA node. For ventricular septal defects the front of the right ventricle can be incised vertically or transversely avoiding any obvious arteries or veins. For operations on the mitral valve, the left atrium is entered from the right through an incision behind the interatrial groove and in front of the two pulmonary veins.</p>
<p>incisions through the aorta, pulmonary trunk and both atria. The incision line through the right atrium leaves the two venae cavae, the posterior wall of the atrium and the region of the SA node in situ. The posterior part of the left atrium with the four pulmonary vein orifices is also left intact. The donor heart is trimmed through the atria to match up with the remains of the patient&rsquo;s atria, although the lower end of the donor superior vena cava remains attached to the right atrium so that the donor heart retains its own SA node. For combined heart-lung transplantation, the donor block is removed through the trachea, right atrium and aorta, and sutured to the recipient in that order.</p>
<p>The posterior mediastinum is the space posterior to the pericardium and to the diaphragm. It is continuous directly, via the posterior part of the superior mediastinum, with the tissue spaces behind the pretracheal fascia and in front of the prevertebral fascia, that is, with the retropharyngeal space and the spaces lateral to trachea and esophagus, between these tubes and the carotid sheaths. It is bounded posteriorly by thoracic vertebrae 4-12 and anteriorly above by the pericardium (left atrium) and below by the posterior sloping fibers of the diaphragm (Fig. 4.11). It contains some structures proper to itself and others that pass between the superior mediastinum and the abdomen. These latter structures will be described as a whole during their intrathoracic course.</p>
<p>This great arterial trunk commences at the lower border of T4 vertebra, where the arch of the aorta ends (Fig. 4.15). At first to the left of the midline, the vessel slants gradually to leave the posterior mediastinum in the midline at the level of T12 vertebra by passing behind the diaphragm between the crura (i.e. behind the median arcuate ligament). It gives off from each side nine posterior intercostal arteries (p. 248), a subcostal artery (p. 360), bronchial arteries (p. 285) and some small esophageal vessels (see below).</p>
<p>This muscular tube extends from the cricoid cartilage (at the level of C6 vertebra) to the cardiac orifice of the stomach (at the level of T10 vertebra and the left seventh costal cartilage). It is 25 cm (10 in) long.</p>
<p>The cervical portion of the esophagus (p. 434), lying in front of the prevertebral fascia, inclines slightly to the left of the midline, but enters the thoracic inlet in the midline in front of the body of T1 vertebra. Passing downwards now through the superior mediastinum (Fig. 4.14) the tube is slightly to the left of the midline behind the left bronchus, which may indent it slightly, as seen radiographically. The esophagus, all this time in contact with the vertebral bodies, now inclines forward with a concavity more marked than that of the vertebral column, passes in front of the descending thoracic aorta (Fig. 4.15), in contact with the pericardium, and pierces the diaphragm 2.5 cm (1 in) to the left of the midline, opposite the body of T10 vertebra. This level can be indicated on the anterior body wall on the seventh left costal cartilage a thumb&rsquo;s breadth from the side of the sternum. Fibers from the right crus of the diaphragm sweep around the esophageal opening in a sling-like loop (p. 249). The intraabdominal part of the esophagus varies in length according to the tone of its muscle and the degree of distension of the stomach. It averages 1-2 cm.</p>
<p>In the superior mediastinum the esophagus is crossed by the arch of the aorta on its left side, and the vena azygos on its right (Figs 4.14 and 4.15). Just below the bifurcation of the trachea, in the posterior mediastinum, it is crossed anteriorly by the left main bronchus and the right pulmonary artery (Fig. 4.31). The thoracic duct lying at first behind it to the right, ascends with an inclination to the left, and in the superior mediastinum lies on the prevertebral fascia to the left of the esophagus. The mediastinal pleura touches the esophagus in places, particularly on the right side, where low down there is a pocket of pleura between the esophagus and the aorta, but nowhere is the pleura attached to the esophagus.</p>
<p>Above the esophageal opening in the diaphragm, firm connective tissue connects the posterior surface of the esophagus to the aorta; it is the loosening of this attachment which allows the esophagus to rise in the sliding type of hiatus hernia (p. 251). At the level of the esophageal opening, the anterior wall of the esophagus is only very loosely attached to the margin of the opening, so allowing for diaphragmatic movement during respiration and the opening and closing of the cardia.</p>
<p><strong>Constrictions.</strong> The narrowest part of the esophagus is its commencement at the cricopharyngeal sphincter (p. 488), 15 cm (6 in) from the incisor teeth. Other sites where slight constrictions may be expected are where it is crossed by the aortic arch 22 cm (9 in) from the teeth, by the left principal bronchus (at 27 cm or 11 in), and where it passes through the opening in the diaphragm (38 cm or 15 in). Although the left atrium is in front of the lower part below the left bronchus, it is only when enlarged that the atrium causes an indentation in the esophagus.</p>
<h2 id="blood-supply-3">
  Blood Supply
  <a class="anchor" href="#blood-supply-3">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The upper esophagus, from the cricoid cartilage down to the level of the arch of the aorta in the superior mediastinum, is supplied by the inferior thyroid arteries, the middle portion by esophageal branches from the aorta, and the lower part by the esophageal branches of the left gastric artery. Venous return from the upper part is to the brachiocephalic veins, from the middle part to the azygos veins, and from the lower reaches by esophageal tributaries of the left gastric vein, which empties into the portal vein. Thus there exists, in the lower part of the esophagus, an anastomosis between portal and systemic venous systems. This anastomosis lies level with the central tendon (T8 vertebra) well above the esophageal hiatus in the diaphragm. In cases of portal obstruction varicosities of these veins occur, and their rupture may give rise to serious or fatal hemorrhage.</p>
<p>Lymph channels from the esophagus follow the arteries, and so lead to deep cervical nodes near the origin of the inferior thyroid artery, to the tracheobronchial group, and to the pre-aortic nodes of the celiac group. However, within the esophageal walls there are lymphatic channels which enable lymph to pass for long distances within the viscus so that drainage to one particular group of nodes from any given area cannot be relied upon.</p>
<p>The upper part of the esophagus is supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve and by sympathetic fibers from cell bodies in the middle cervical ganglion running in on the inferior thyroid arteries. The lower part receives fibers from the sympathetic trunks and greater splanchnic nerves, while the parasympathetic supply is from the vagus nerves which form anterior and posterior esophageal plexuses on the respective surfaces. These plexuses, which form a wide-meshed network that encircles the tube below the level of the lung roots, are essentially parasympathetic and their fibers become collected together over the last few centimeters of the thoracic esophagus as the anterior and posterior vagal trunks (p. 334). The anterior trunk contains predominantly left vagal fibers and the posterior mainly right fibers, but both trunks have fibers from both vagi.</p>
<p>the nucleus ambiguus for the upper striated-muscle part, and from the dorsal motor nucleus with relay in plexuses in the wall for the lower visceral muscle part. The glands also receive secretomotor fibers from the vagus but these are derived from cell bodies in the inferior salivary nucleus. There are also afferent fibers in the vagi with cell bodies in the inferior vagal ganglia, but pain fibers appear to run with both the vagal and the vasomotor sympathetic supply, since (like cardiac pain) esophageal pain can be referred to the neck, arm and thoracic wall.</p>
<h2 id="structure-1">
  Structure
  <a class="anchor" href="#structure-1">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The muscular wall consists of an inner circular and an outer longitudinal layer which are of skeletal muscle in the upper third and visceral muscle in the lower two-thirds of the tube. There is no sharp line of demarcation between these two areas; there is considerable overlap of the two types of muscle. The skeletal muscle provides rapid contraction so that the bolus is quickly passed well into the esophagus, and the larynx may safely open to resume breathing. Except for the short intraabdominal segment, there is no serous covering of the tube. The mucous membrane is thick and in the collapsed state thrown into longitudinal folds. There is a thick muscularis mucosae. The surface epithelium of the mucous membrane is stratified squamous. The mucosa contains scattered lymphoid follicles. In the submucosa are mucous glands that are rather sparse and found for the most part at the upper and lower ends of the tube. The outer longitudinal layer of muscle is attached by fibrous strands to the midline ridge on the back of the lamina of the cricoid cartilage, and to the arytenoid cartilages. The inner circular layer is in direct continuity with the circopharyngeus muscle (p. 488). Although there is no anatomical thickening of muscle at the lower end of the esophagus, the last 5 cm or so (2 in) undoubtedly acts as a physiological sphincter.</p>
<h2 id="surgical-approach-1">
  Surgical Approach
  <a class="anchor" href="#surgical-approach-1">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The cervical part of the esophagus is approached in the neck by opening up the interval between the trachea and the carotid sheath. In the thorax, a long length of esophagus is readily accessible on the right side in front of the vertebral column, especially after transecting the azygos arch (Fig. 4.14). The posterior intercostal vessels and thoracic duct are at risk when mobilizing the esophagus posteriorly. The lower part is more easily approached from the left side, above the diaphragm (Fig. 4.15) in the interval between the heart in front and the aorta behind.</p>
<h2 id="lymph-nodes-of-the-thorax">
  Lymph Nodes of the Thorax
  <a class="anchor" href="#lymph-nodes-of-the-thorax">#</a>
</h2>
<p>In the posterior mediastinum the nodes are arranged in series with those of the abdomen. The visceral preaortic nodes lie in front of the aorta and drain the middle reaches of the esophagus. The somatic paraaortic nodes lie alongside the aorta and extend laterally into the posterior intercostal spaces, where they are known as the posterior intercostal nodes. They drain the parietes (intercostal spaces). The anterior ends of the intercostal spaces drain into parasternal nodes along the internal thoracic artery; they may become involved in cancer of the breast, and drain directly into the brachiocephalic veins.</p>
<p>Heart and lungs drain into the tracheobronchial lymph nodes, which lie around the trachea and its bifurcation. These send their efferents to a right and left mediastinal lymph trunk, which may join the thoracic duct but usually open directly into the brachiocephalic vein of their own side.</p>
<p>There are thus three upgoing lymph channels on each side, namely the parasternal alongside the sternum, the thoracic duct and right lymphatic duct alongside the vertebrae (these drain the thoracic wall) and between them the mediastinal lymph trunks alongside the trachea (these drain lungs, midpart of esophagus, and heart). All six trunks communicate freely with each other.</p>
<p>This, the longest lymphatic channel, commences at the upper end of the cisterna chyli, on a level with the body of T12 vertebra between the aorta and the azygos vein. From behind the right crus it passes upwards to the right of the aorta and comes to lie against the right side of the esophagus. Inclining up to the left, alongside the aorta, it passes behind the esophagus to reach its left side at the superior mediastinum. It lies anterior to the intercostal branches of the aorta. Passing now vertically upwards it finally arches forwards across the dome of the left pleura to enter the point of confluence of the left internal jugular and subclavian veins (Fig. 4.12). It normally divides into two or three separate branches, all of which open at the angle between these two veins. There are no valves at the termination, and blood flows to and fro in the duct as pressures alter with respiratory movements. At autopsy it is common to find the terminal inch or two of the thoracic duct full of blood, because the last of the valves, of which there are many, is a little proximal to the venous junction.</p>
<p>Commencing with the accumulated lymph from the lower half of the body, the duct receives in its course through the thorax lymph from the left posterior intercostal nodes (posterior half of the left thoracic wall). In the neck it receives the left jugular and subclavian lymph trunks and thus finally comes to drain all the lymph of the body except that from the right arm and the right halves of thorax and the head and neck.</p>
<p>Lymph from the posterior right thoracic wall enters the right lymphatic duct. The right upper limb drains into the right subclavian trunk and the right side of the head and neck drains into the right jugular lymph trunk. These three trunks may join together and open into the commencement of the right brachiocephalic vein or they may remain separated and open independently into the great veins (jugular and subclavian).</p>
<p>The thoracic wall and upper lumbar region are drained by the posterior intercostal and lumbar veins into the azygos veins. These consist of longitudinal trunks on right and left sides, similar to the posterior cardinal veins of the embryo. There is a single trunk on the right. On the left side the posterior cardinal vein disappears (p. 45) and is replaced by longitudinal veins that persist from the embryonic prevertebral venous plexuses; these are the hemiazygos veins.</p>
<p>This vessel represents the persistent right posterior cardinal vein of the embryo. Thus it begins embryologically at the inferior vena cava just above the renal veins, but this part is usually an avascular fibrous cord. The union of the ascending lumbar vein with the subcostal vein of the right side is the functional (blood-containing) commencement of the azygos vein. The vessel goes through the aortic opening of the diaphragm under shelter of the right crus (Fig. 4.33) and passes upwards lying on the sides of the vertebral bodies, on a plane posterior to that of the esophagus (Fig. 4.14). Descent of the heart and pericardium in the embryo caused the right posterior cardinal vein to arch over the right bronchus. This the azygos vein does at the level of T4 vertebra and passing forward of the esophagus the vessel enters the superior vena cava. It receives the lower eight posterior intercostal veins and at its convexity the superior intercostal vein joins it. It receives the bronchial veins from the right lung and some veins from the middle third of the esophagus. The two hemiazygos veins join it at the levels of T8 and 9 vertebrae.</p>
<p>These two veins lie longitudinally on the left side of the bodies of the thoracic vertebrae. They may communicate with each other, but characteristically drain separately from their adjoining ends behind the esophagus into the azygos vein. They receive the lower eight posterior intercostal veins, four each. The inferior vein is the hemiazygos vein, and the superior one is the accessory hemiazygos vein. The latter receives the bronchial veins from the left lung and some veins from the middle third of the esophagus.</p>
<p>Lying on the necks of the ribs, just lateral to their heads, and anterior to the intercostal vessels and nerves, is the thoracic part of the sympathetic trunk (Fig. 4.3). It is described as possessing 12 ganglia, one for each intercostal nerve, but characteristically there are fewer, the result of fusion of adjacent ganglia. Thus the first ganglion is commonly fused with the inferior cervical ganglion to form the cervicothoracic (stellate) ganglion. It is simplest, however, to describe them as though they consisted of 12 discrete ganglia. Each receives a white ramus from its corresponding spinal nerve, and this emerges from the anterior ramus of the nerve. After relay in the ganglion a postganglionic gray ramus is given to each thoracic nerve, and this usually lies medial to the white ramus (Fig. 1.21, p. 30).</p>
<p>The heart is supplied with sympathetic fibers from the cervical and upper thoracic ganglia through the cardiac plexus (coronary and cardiac parts, p. 259). The pulmonary part supplies the lungs (p. 286). The trachea and esophagus receive branches from trunk ganglia, but note that the esophageal plexuses (p. 278) are vagal (parasympathetic) plexuses.</p>
<p>The splanchnic nerves, three in number, come from the lower eight ganglia. The lowest, or least splanchnic nerve leaves the twelfth ganglion; the lesser splanchnic nerve comes from the tenth and eleventh. The greater splanchnic nerve is formed by branches from the fifth to the ninth ganglia. Each pierces the crus of its own side to relay in the celiac ganglia (p. 365).</p>
<p>The thoracic trunk is continued upwards over the neck of the first rib as the cervical sympathetic trunk. It crosses the neck of the first rib well on the medial side, near the head. The main part of the first thoracic nerve, passing out of the thorax into the neck to join the brachial plexus, crosses the neck of the first rib more laterally. Between the two at this level lie the supreme intercostal vein medially, and the superior intercostal artery laterally. Classical description of the ganglia consists of describing the first thoracic ganglion as lying below the neck of the first rib, and the inferior cervical ganglion lying in the root of the neck just above the neck of the rib, posteromedial to the vertebral artery. More often than not, however, these two ganglia are fused into a single mass, the cervicothoracic or stellate ganglion, overlying the neck of the first rib (Fig. 4.5). It is very variable in size, and may measure as much as 2 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter.</p>
<p>The thoracic trunk is continued downwards into the abdomen by passing behind the medial arcuate ligament of the diaphragm, lying on the front of the fascia of the upper part of the psoas muscle. It makes an abrupt step forwards from the neck of the eleventh (or even the tenth) rib to the front of the body of L1 vertebra, and this part of the trunk is very slender.</p>
<p>In the cervical approach (p. 32) from above the clavicle, scalenus anterior and the suprapleural membrane are divided (avoiding damage to the phrenic nerve) and the subclavian artery is displaced downwards so that the pleura can be stripped off the vertebral column and adjacent parts of the ribs to expose the trunk. The second and third thoracic ganglia and the intervening trunk are removed. In the axillary approach the pleural cavity is entered through the bed of the third rib and the pleura incised over the trunk.</p>
<p>Like peritoneum, the pleura is a membrane of fibrous tissue surfaced by a single layer of very flat cells (mesothelium) to make it slippery. It clothes each lung and lines the containing cavity.</p>
<p>wall (rib cage), to which it is attached by areolar tissue named the endothoracic fascia. It covers the thoracic surface of the diaphragm, from which it ascends over the pericardium to cover the mediastinum and to cling to the suprapleural membrane at the thoracic inlet. This is one continuous sheet. From its mediastinal layer a cuff of membrane is projected around the lung root and passes on to invest the surface of the lung. This is the visceral layer of the pleura; it extends into the depths of the interlobar clefts. The pleural cavity is a completely closed space. The visceral pleura on the lung surface is in contact with parietal pleura, but the anterior and inferior reflections of the parietal pleura extend further than the lung edge, to allow space for lung expansion. In these situations the costal parietal pleura is in contact anteriorly with mediastinal and inferiorly with diaphragmatic parietal pleura.</p>
<p>Outside the pleura, and lining the thoracic wall, is a layer of loose areolar tissue similar to the transversalis fascia of the abdomen, which binds the parietal pleura to the inner side of the chest wall and transversus thoracis group of muscles where these exist. This loose areolar tissue has been named the endothoracic fascia; it is almost unworthy of anatomical description, being nowhere membranous, and consisting merely of the fibrous tissue that attaches the pleura to the chest wall. A similar layer binds the pleura to the diaphragm. No such arrangement exists on the fibrous pericardium. Here the slippery pleura is thin, and so adherent that the two cannot be separated.</p>
<p>The parietal pleura is supplied by somatic nerves, namely the intercostals, segmentally in zones on its costal extent; the diaphragmatic pleura is supplied by the phrenic nerve over the domes, and by intercostal nerves around its periphery. The mediastinal pleura is supplied by the phrenic nerve. The visceral pleura has only an autonomic (i.e. vasomotor) supply - it is insensitive to ordinary stimuli.</p>
<h2 id="surface-markings">
  Surface Markings
  <a class="anchor" href="#surface-markings">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The parietal pleura lines the costal walls of the thorax; seen from in front its lateral surface marking is the horizon of the thoracic cage (Fig. 4.30). It projects above the medial third of the clavicle for nearly 3 cm (over an inch). This convexity, well seen in radiographs of the chest, is due to the obliquity of the thoracic inlet (Fig. 4.9). The neck of the first rib lies well above the clavicle, and the surface marking of the dome of the pleura (and the apex of the lung) is merely the projection of the inner border of the first rib. There is normally no encroachment of lung or pleura above the oblique plane of the thoracic inlet except for a minor amount of bulging above the subclavian groove, beneath the suprapleural membrane just in front of the neck of the first rib (Fig. 4.5).</p>
<p>Tracing the pleura now (Fig. 4.30) from behind the sternoclavicular joint, downwards behind the sternum and around the costodiaphragmatic gutter, there is a point to be noted at each of the even-numbered ribs (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12) as follows. The line of pleural reflection slopes downwards from the sternoclavicular joint to meet its fellow at the second rib level, that is, at the sternal angle. Lying together or even overlapping, with the right pleura perhaps to the left of the midline they pass vertically behind the sternum down to the fourth costal cartilage. Here the right pleura continues vertically, but the left arches out and descends lateral to the border of the sternum, halfway to the apex of the heart. Each turns laterally at the sixth costal cartilage, and passing around the chest wall crosses the midclavicular line at the eighth rib, and the midaxillary at the tenth rib. This lower border is the costodiaphragmatic recess; it falls somewhat short of the costal margin between sternum and midaxillary line. It crosses the twelfth rib at the lateral border of erector spinae and passes in horizontally to the lower border of the twelfth thoracic vertebra. There is thus a triangle of pleura in the costovertebral angle below the twelfth rib, behind the upper pole of the kidney, a fact to be noted in incisions and wounds in this region (Fig. 5.46, p. 367).</p>
<p>The anatomy of an intercostal space determines the route for removing fluid (or air) from the pleural cavity. Aspiration needles or drainage tubes are passed through the chest wall close to the upper border of a rib (lower part of an intercostal space) to avoid the vessels and nerve which course along the lower border of a rib (upper part of a space) (Fig. 4.4). The choice of space may be determined by the localization of fluid, e.g. a walled-off abscess, but for general purposes the fourth space in or just in front of the midaxillary line is often chosen. A needle, trocar and cannula or drainage tube inserted here is not near any major structure and is high enough to avoid the dome of the diaphragm.</p>
<p>Each lung, consisting of two lobes on the left and three on the right, lies within its own side of the thoracic cavity and is surrounded by the visceral layer of the pleura. Each has a principal or main bronchus, one pulmonary artery and two pulmonary veins, all of which undergo subdivisions within the lung substance, together with bronchial vessels, nerves and lymphatics. The region where the lung is connected to the mediastinum, largely by the bronchus and pulmonary vessels, is the root of the lung, and the region of the lung where these structures enter or leave is the hilum. The lung surface is mottled, and in color is pink or gray according to the atmosphere in which it has lived. It is crepitant to the touch. The lung conforms to the shape of the cavity which contains it. It has a convex costal surface and a concave diaphragmatic surface, separated from each other by a sharply-angled inferior border. The posterior border of each lung is generously rounded to fit the paravertebral gutter, and is continued up to the convex apex. The anterior border is thin and sharp; on the left side the lower part of this border is deeply concave — the cardiac notch. The mediastinal surfaces differ somewhat. On the left side the cardiac notch is seen to be the anterior margin of a deep concavity produced by the pericardium in front of the hilum; the arch and ascending aorta make a deep groove on the lung surface around the hilum. Above the aortic arch are vertical impressions made by the subclavian artery and (behind the artery) the esophagus. On the right the cardiac impression is much shallower; a groove for the azygos vein curves over the hilum to meet the impression made by the superior vena cava. Above the azygos arch and behind the vena cava are grooves for the trachea and esophagus. The apices are grooved by the subclavian arteries (Figs 4.5 and 4.12). The other relations of the apices are best studied with the root of the neck (p. 442).</p>
<p>When a lung is removed by a clean cut at the side of the mediastinum, the cut surface on the mediastinum is the lung root; the corresponding cut surface on the lung is the hilum. The left and right lung roots are similar but not identical.</p>
<p>In the left lung root (Fig. 4.15) the upper part is occupied by the left pulmonary artery lying within the concavity of the arch of the aorta. Below and behind it is seen the left bronchus as it slopes downwards from the bifurcation of the trachea. There are two pulmonary veins, one in front of and the other below the bronchus. These structures are enclosed in a sleeve of pleura - a sleeve that is too big for the lung root, as a coat cuff is too big for a wrist, so that it hangs down in an empty fold, the pulmonary ligament. It is, of course, not a ligament, neither is it concerned with the lung; it provides the necessary freedom or dead space for the structures of the lung root. Its two layers separate on descent of the lung root in inspiration and on enlargement of the pulmonary veins during increased pulmonary blood flow.</p>
<p>In the right lung root (Fig. 4.14) the general arrangement of structures is similar to that on the left, but the bronchus to the upper lobe (the eparterial bronchus) and the branch of the pulmonary artery to the upper lobe leave the main bronchus outside the lung. Thus the upper lobe bronchus and its accompanying artery are found above the level of the main bronchus in the root. The two pulmonary veins are disposed as on the left side, in front of and below the main bronchus. The root of the right lung lies within the curve of the azygos vein and is surrounded by a sleeve of pleura with a dependent pulmonary ligament, as on the left.</p>
<p>The left pulmonary artery (p. 372) attached to the under surface of the aortic arch by the ligamentum arteriosum, quickly spirals over the top of the left bronchus to reach the back of the bronchus and enter the hilum of the lung. The right pulmonary artery, longer than the left, passes below the carina anterior to the esophagus, and at the lung root is held anterior to the right main bronchus by the upper lobe bronchus (Fig. 4.31). It gives off its branch to the upper lobe and then enters the hilum.</p>
<h2 id="fissures">
  Fissures
  <a class="anchor" href="#fissures">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The oblique fissure (Figs 4.35 &amp; 4.36) extends from the surface of the lung to the hilum and divides the organ into separate upper and lower lobes which are connected only by the lobar bronchi and vessels. In 50% of lungs the fissure may not be complete. On the right lung a horizontal fissure (Fig. 4.35) passes from the anterior margin into the oblique fissure to separate a wedge shaped middle lobe from the upper lobe. The visceral pleura, clothing the surface of the lung, extends inwards to line the depths of the fissures. The middle lobe of the right lung is completely separate from the upper lobe in only about one-third of individuals; in the remainder the fissure separating it from the upper lobe is incomplete or even absent (10%). On the left lung the lowest and most medial part of the upper lobe that overlaps the front of the pericardium is the lingula and forms the boundary of the cardiac notch; it corresponds to the middle lobe of the right lung but is never separate.</p>
<p>The oblique fissure of each lung makes a slippery surface between the two halves. This promotes easier and more uniform expansion of the whole lung. Movements of the chest wall and diaphragm are of greater range towards the base of the lung. The great elasticity of the lung encourages equal expansion throughout, but the apex is greatly helped to expand by the lower part of the upper lobe being so near the diaphragm and lower chest wall. Descent of segments 4 and 5 improves expansion of segments 1, 2 and 3 (Figs 4.35, 4.36). Thus the obliquity of the great fissure is functional, for if the lung were divided into two halves by a horizontal fissure this would have less effect on apical expansion.</p>
<p>On upper costal walls and the supraclavicular region, the surface markings of the lungs coincide with those of the pleura (Fig. 4.30). The anterior border of the right lung falls very little short of the pleura, lying within the lateral margin of the sternum; that of the left lung in contrast curves laterally to uncover the area of superficial cardiac dullness from the fourth costal cartilage out to the apex beat in the fifth intercostal space just medial to the midclavicular line. From these points the lower border of the lung lies nearly horizontally around the chest wall, but two ribs higher than the pleural reflection, i.e. in the midclavicular line at the sixth rib, midaxillary line at the eighth rib, and at the lateral border of erector spinae at the tenth rib.</p>
<p>The oblique fissures of each lung are indicated by a line joining the spine of T3 vertebra (which is opposite the posterior end of the fifth rib) to the sixth rib in the midclavicular line. More simply, this is approximately the line of the fifth rib, or level with the vertebral border of the scapula when the arm is fully abducted above the head. On the right the fourth costal cartilage overlies the horizontal fissure between the upper and middle lobes; continued horizontally this line meets the oblique fissure in the midaxillary line.</p>

  Lobar and Segmental Bronchi
  <a class="anchor" href="#lobar-and-segmental-bronchi">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Because the left lung grows into a smaller cavity than the right, the way bronchi divide to supply segments of lung is not identical on the two sides, although there are close similarities.</p>
<p>From the bifurcation of the trachea (p. 260) each main bronchus (Figs 4.32-4.34) passes downwards and laterally to enter the hilum of the lung. They are approximately 5 cm (2 in) long, but the right is slightly shorter and more vertical than the left. At the bifurcation an anteroposterior internal ridge, the carina, lies to the left of the midline, so that foreign bodies that fall down the trachea are more likely to enter the right bronchus.</p>
<p>Each main bronchus gives rise to lobar bronchi (Fig. 4.32) that supply the lobes of the lung. The right main bronchus gives off the upper lobe bronchus outside the hilum and ends within the hilum by dividing into middle and lower lobe bronchi. The left main bronchus divides within the hilum into upper and lower lobar bronchi. The tissues of the bronchi are supplied by the bronchial arteries. The veins of the right main bronchus drain to the azygos vein and those of the left to the accessory hemiazygos vein.</p>
<p>Each lobar bronchus gives rise to further branches, the segmental bronchi (Fig. 4.32), for each segment of the lung. There are typically 10 bronchopulmonary segments in each lung and therefore 10 segmental bronchi are to be expected. Ten individual segmental bronchi can usually be distinguished on the right, but on the left it is usual for one or more segmental bronchi to share a common stem. Each lung segment is roughly pyramidal in shape, with its apex towards the hilum and base towards the surface of the lung. The bronchopulmonary segments are given the same names and numbers as the segmental bronchi, which are listed as follows:</p>

<p>posterior surface of the bronchial tree, so that when lying on the back it is the highest bronchus into which fluid can gravitate.</p>
<p>The bronchial tree receives its own arterial supply by the bronchial arteries. There are usually three: two on the left which are direct branches from the aorta, and one on the right coming from the third right posterior intercostal artery. They supply the bronchi from the carina to their ultimate ramifications (respiratory bronchioles) and nourish also adjacent lymph nodes and the visceral pleura. The bronchial veins fall into a superficial system draining from the hilar region and visceral pleura into the azygos vein on the right and the accessory hemiazygos on the left, and a deep system from the deeper lung substance draining to a main pulmonary vein or directly into the left atrium (thus mixing venous with arterial blood). The alveoli contain within their walls a rich capillary plexus which is fed with deoxygenated blood by the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery divides with the bronchi; every bronchus is accompanied by a branch of the artery. The artery supplies no bronchus but it does supply the alveoli, giving them all they need except oxygen, of which they have more than enough. There is some anastomosis between the bronchial and pulmonary arteries at precapillary level, though peripherally there is some overspill of bronchial capillaries into the alveolar capillaries. The pulmonary veins are formed from tributaries which do not closely follow the bronchi but tend to run in the intersegmental septa. Two pulmonary veins leave each hilum, one from above and one from below the oblique fissure.</p>
<h2 id="lymph-drainage-2">
  Lymph Drainage
  <a class="anchor" href="#lymph-drainage-2">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Lymphatic channels run towards the hilum, from the pleura along the bronchi and pulmonary artery. Lymphatic tissue occurs as isolated follicles beneath the pleura and in the mucous membrane of the bronchi, usually straddling the bifurcations. Lymph nodes in the hilum lie just within and just without the lung substance. These hilar nodes drain to the tracheobronchial group, thence upwards by mediastinal lymph trunks to the brachiocephalic veins.</p>
<p>The pulmonary plexus (from the cardiac plexus — p. 259) at the hilum of each lung sends its autonomic fibers along the bronchial tree. The parasympathetic fibers (vagus nerve) are afferent (cell bodies in the inferior ganglion) and efferent (cell bodies in dorsal nucleus, with relay in the bronchial mucosa). They provide the afferent fibers for the cough reflex (p. 503), important for clearing excess secretions and inhaled substances from the tracheobronchial tree; the receptors are unmyelinated endings in the epithelium. The vagi also provide the pathway for the response to bronchial stimulation by a catheter passed down the trachea (one of the tests for brainstem death - p. 616). Included among the afferent fibers are those subserving pain. The vagal efferents are motor to the smooth muscle of the bronchi and the pulmonary arterioles, shutting both down for economy of effort. The sympathetic fibers relay in the upper four thoracic ganglia; their connector cells lie in the lateral horn of T2-6 segments of the cord. The sympathetic efferents are dilator to the pulmonary arterioles and to the bronchi, to accommodate the higher cardiac output and increased pulmonary ventilation that accompany storming the citadel.</p>
<h2 id="structure-2">
  Structure
  <a class="anchor" href="#structure-2">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Bronchi have smooth muscle and hyaline cartilage in their walls and are lined by the typical respiratory type of epithelium - pseudostratified columnar ciliated, with mucous glands. By successive divisions they become smaller and smaller; when cartilage disappears (at a diameter of about 1 mm) bronchi become bronchioles. The more distal divisions of bronchioles, where cilia begin to disappear, are respiratory bronchioles, so called because some alveoli (air sacs) open off them. The bronchioles just proximal to respiratory bronchioles are rather confusingly called terminal bronchioles, but they are not the end of the line as far as tubule division is concerned; they are the most peripheral bronchioles that do not bear any alveoli, and there are about 25,000 in each lung. There can be as many as 27 generations of divisions beyond the main bronchi; the first 19 are conducting airways, as far as terminal bronchioles, with no gaseous exchange, but often there are no more than five or six divisions before the terminal bronchioles are reached. Each terminal bronchiole with its subsequent branches constitutes a lung acinus. Beyond the respiratory bronchioles are the respiratory ducts, with many alveoli opening off them, and these continue into alveolar ducts which have a lining of cubical epithelium (but no cilia) and also many alveoli. Finally there are the alveolar sacs which become cubicalized into alveoli; the alveolar sacs may be likened to the central area of a room in a library or museum, with cubicles (alveoli) arranged round the sides (but also through the floor and ceiling!). Do not confuse alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs and alveoli.</p>
<p>The walls of the alveoli contain capillaries and various cells such as fibroblasts, macrophages and mast cells. The lining of the alveoli consists of two kinds of epithelial cells. The commonest (95%) are the squamous cells, flattened like vascular endothelium and sometimes called pneumocytes type I, through which gaseous exchange can occur. The other 5% are the secretory cells (type II) containing the characteristic whorl-like lamellar bodies with a high phospholipid content; when discharged from the cell they produce the surfactant effect (reducing surface tension).</p>
<p>Each lung develops from a bud at the lower end of the laryngotracheal tube that grows down from the floor of the primitive pharynx (Fig. 1.29, p. 37). These epithelial (endodermal) buds form only the epithelial part of the lung; the connective tissue, cartilage and muscle of the bronchial tree are derived from the surrounding mesoderm. By the fifth month the lung has a glandular appearance, with clumps of epithelial cells and hardly any recognizable lumina, but the cell groups become expanded and lie adjacent to a multitude of capillaries so that by the seventh month there are sufficient alveoli to sustain a viable infant following premature birth at this time. Surfactant begins to be secreted about the sixth month.</p>
<p>In the fetus the lungs are not just a mass of collapsed air spaces but are full of fluid, largely secreted by the lungs but with a contribution from swallowed amniotic fluid. At the time of birth some is squeezed out by thoracic pressure and the rest escapes into blood capillaries and lymphatics, assisted by surfactant action. After birth there is no new development of any kind of bronchioles, but perhaps 90% of the adult number of alveoli are budded off during about the first 8 years of life.</p>
<h2 id="surgical-approach-2">
  Surgical Approach
  <a class="anchor" href="#surgical-approach-2">#</a>
</h2>
<p>For pneumonectomy the approaches on each side are similar, although the order in which the principal structures are dealt with may differ. On the left, after a posterolateral thoracotomy through the bed of the sixth rib, the lung is displaced downwards and forwards so that, after visualizing the pleura behind the hilum, the vagus can be divided distal to the recurrent laryngeal branch, and the pulmonary artery divided distal to the ligamentum arteriosum. This is followed by division of the upper pulmonary vein with the lung displaced backwards, and the lower pulmonary vein and the main bronchus with the lung pushed forwards again. The nearness of the aortic arch may make closure of the bronchus difficult.</p>
<p>On the right the pleura is incised in front of the hilum, and the upper pulmonary vein and the pulmonary artery are divided first, then the lower vein is divided with the lung reflected forwards, and finally the main bronchus is divided working from the front again. The arch of the azygos vein is preserved if possible since it affords collateral circulation if the superior vena cava is obstructed. The latter may have to be displaced forwards to allow satisfactory ligation of the pulmonary artery.</p>
<p>Study the general features in an articulated skeleton (Fig. 4.30), remembering that cartilage cannot be preserved dry. Make allowances for costal cartilages that may be distorted. The cage is convex, narrow above and below like a barrel, but flattened from front to back. In conformity with the general convexity of the thoracic wall the first rib has an upper surface and a sharp external border; its pleural surface looks downwards, instead of inwards like the others. The vertebral column projects into the cage, leaving a deep paravertebral gutter on either side. A cross-section is shaped like a kidney, with the vertebral body making the hilum. The ribs slope down from the vertebral column towards the sternum at an angle of 45°; note this, and remember it later when handling individual ribs.</p>
<p>The angles of the ribs show as a line of ridges, one at the posterior convexity of each rib, lateral to the transverse processes of the thoracic vertebrae. An angle scarcely exists on the first rib, where it coincides with the tubercle, but from here down the angle lies progressively farther laterally. The ridge at the angle lies vertically across the obliquity of the rib (Fig. 4.38). It is made by the attachment of the thoracolumbar fascia that encloses erector spinae; this muscle is widest behind the twelfth rib and narrows as it passes upwards (Fig. 6.74, p. 545).</p>
<p>The term angle always refers to the posterior angle of a rib (Fig. 4.38). There is what might be called unofficially an anterior angle, but this is much less pronounced, and cannot be made out on every rib. It lies a few centimeters from the anterior extremity of the rib and consists of a low plateau, triangular in shape (apex up). It is for the origin of external oblique (hence absent from the upper four ribs) and is usually best seen on the sixth and seventh ribs (Fig. 4.37).</p>
<p>seven cartilages become progressively longer from the first to the seventh. The upper three cartilages lie nearly horizontal, but below this the cartilages, themselves bent, pass progressively more obliquely upwards as they converge towards the lower end of the sternum (Fig. 4.30). The costal margin is made by the seventh to tenth cartilages. Below this the eleventh and twelfth ribs, each capped by an apex of cartilage, float free in muscles.</p>
<p>Like the ribs, most of the sternum is made of cancellous bone which throughout life is filled with hematopoietic marrow. The thin layer of compact bone on the surface is scored and perforated by multiple minute vessels. The main parts, manubrium and body, are connected by a secondary cartilaginous joint that normally never ossifies and contributes to movement of the ribs. The small third part, the xiphoid process, projects down from the lower end of the body.</p>
<p>The manubrium is a flat four-sided bone broader above than below (Fig. 4.5). Its upper margin is concave, the jugular notch, and this receives the interclavicular ligament. It is spanned by the investing layer of deep cervical fascia, attached to the anterior and posterior borders of the notch (p. 422). Each upper angle of the manubrium is scooped out into a concavity for the sternoclavicular joint. The articular surface, covered mostly by fibrocartilage rather than hyaline cartilage, lies in contact with the disc, while the capsule and synovial membrane are attached to the articular margin. Below the clavicular surface the lateral border is excavated for about 2 cm to receive the first costal cartilage (a primary cartilaginous joint). At the inferior angle is a demifacet, a small cartilage-covered area for articulation (synovial) with the upper part of the second costal cartilage. The inferior border of the manubrium is irregular and undulating; like the reciprocal upper border of the body it is coated with hyaline cartilage for the manubriosternal secondary cartilaginous joint. The anterior surface gives origin to pectoralis major alongside the lateral border, and more medially the tendon of sternocleidomastoid is attached; neither of these marks the bone. Posteriorly sternohyoid arises from a strip of bone alongside the clavicular margin while below this the origin of sternothyroid curves alongside the border of the bone below the facet for the first costal cartilage. Most of the posterior surface is bare. It lies against the lung margins in their pleural sacs, between which the left brachiocephalic vein touches the bone unless thymic remnants lie between.</p>
<p>The body of the sternum (gladiolus) carries articular facets along its lateral border. The lower part of the second costal cartilage articulates with a demifacet at the upper angle, making a synovial joint separate from that with the manubrium. Below this the border of the sternum is indented by five more cartilage-covered facets. These make single synovial joints with the costal cartilages (Fig. 4.2). The facets for the sixth and seventh costal cartilages may coalesce, especially in the female. Between the costal facets the lateral border of the sternum gives attachment to the anterior intercostal membrane and the internal intercostal muscle. The bone of this lateral border receives nutrient branches from the internal thoracic artery. Three faint ridges cross the anterior surface between the facets for the third, fourth and fifth cartilages; they mark the lines of fusion of adjacent sternebrae (p. 294). Pectoralis major arises widely from the anterior surface almost to the midline, and transversus thoracis arises from the posterior surface low down. From the posterior surface the weak sternopericardial ligaments pass, above and below, into the fibrous pericardium.</p>
<p>From the posterior margin of the body the xiphoid process (xiphisternum) projects downwards for attachment of the linea alba. It represents the unossified lower end of the body, with which it usually forms a symphysis. The process may ossify late in life.</p>
<p>The ossification of the sternum is dealt with on page 293, and its movements on page 252.</p>
<p>Note the multiple attachments of large sheets of muscle. Lateral to the sternum, pectoralis major has slips of origin from the upper six costal cartilages. Serratus anterior is attached to the upper eight ribs; the first rib has only a thin external border available, so the first digitation spans the intercostal space along a fibrous band and is attached, with the second digitation, to a rough plateau which characterizes the second rib. The next digitations arise behind pectoralis minor, and the last four interdigitate with external oblique. So the eight digitations at the border of serratus anterior form a bold forward convexity. Pectoralis minor is attached to the third to fifth ribs (often also to the second) just in front of serratus anterior. External oblique arises from the anterior angles of the lower eight ribs; below serratus anterior it interdigitates with latissimus dorsi on the last four ribs. Rectus abdominis is attached to the anterior surfaces of the fifth to seventh costal cartilages and the lower border of the seventh. Lateral to this the lower borders of the last six costal cartilages receive the internal oblique. Transversus abdominis and the diaphragm interdigitate on the internal surfaces of the lower six costal cartilages. The serratus posterior muscles, lying on the thoracolumbar fascia, are inserted just lateral to the ridges at the posterior angles of their respective ribs - the second to fifth for the superior and the last four ribs for the inferior muscle. Between the angles and the transverse processes (i.e. the tubercles of the ribs) the iliocostalis and longissimus parts of erector spinae are attached, and a levator costae is inserted into the upper border of each rib just lateral to its tubercle. The scalene muscles and quadratus lumborum are attached to the thoracic cage, above and below; they belong with the intercostal muscles to the various layers of the body wall (p. 242). Their attachments will be noted in the study of the individual ribs. On the internal surfaces of the ribs the subcostal muscles lie in the paravertebral gutter, and the innermost intercostals lie in the lateral curve of the thoracic wall; each sheet widens from above down, but neither leaves any mark on the ribs. Between these sheets of muscle parietal pleura clothes the ribs and costal cartilages, except at the cardiac notch alongside the sternum behind the fifth and sixth left costal cartilages. Transversus thoracis is attached behind the medial ends of the second to sixth costal cartilages.</p>

  Surface Markings
  <a class="anchor" href="#surface-markings-1">#</a>
</h2>
<p>In the living the sternal angle is visible and palpable. The second costal cartilage can be easily felt at either side of the angle; the ribs must be counted down from here as the only certain guide to their numerical identification. The downward inclination of the ribs is indicated by the vertebral levels of the sternum. The jugular notch lies at the level of the upper border of the third, the sternal angle at the lower border of the fourth, and the lower end of the sternum at the lower border of the eighth thoracic vertebrae. The surface markings of the heart (p. 266), pleura and lungs (p. 281 and 284) have already been studied. Movements of the ribs are considered on page 252.</p>
<h2 id="ribs">
  Ribs
  <a class="anchor" href="#ribs">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The first, eleventh and twelfth ribs are atypical (and perhaps the tenth). A typical rib from the middle of the rest of the series has a head, a neck and a shaft (Fig. 4.38). A tubercle projects posteriorly from the end of the neck. The shaft slopes down and laterally to an angle and then curves forward. The upper border of the shaft is blunt. Lateral to the angle (p. 288) the lower border projects down as a sharp ridge sheltering a costal groove. These features identify right from left ribs. They will be studied soon, but first lay the separate ribs in order on a table. The upper six lie reasonably flat, but the seventh to ninth show a degree of torsion at their angles that lifts the posterior end of each in a slope of 30° from the table. The tenth, eleventh and twelfth lie flat. The upper six ribs are bent into a tight curve, so that the end of the shaft has turned parallel with the neck of the rib (as in Fig. 4.7) to reach the front of the chest at a relatively short costal cartilage. The lower six ribs show an opening out of the curve, which in their case is completed by the long costal cartilages at the front of the chest.</p>
<p>The necks of the ribs are of equal length (except in the eleventh and twelfth), but the distance from tubercle to angle increases from above down as already noted in the articulated thoracic cage. This distance becomes equal to the neck length at the fifth and sixth rib. The tubercles of the typical ribs carry two oval facets. The medial one (for a synovial joint) of the upper six ribs is convex and projected backwards but in the next four ribs is flat and faces backwards and slightly downwards.</p>
<p>From all the above features it is easy to identify a rib of the upper, middle or lower part of the series.</p>
<p>The rib lies on the table in an unnatural position. Pick it up and hold it in its anatomical position; the shaft slopes down at 45° and the ridge at the angle is almost vertical. The angle is the most posterior part of the rib. Study the rib in this position (Fig. 4.38).</p>
<p>The head is beveled by two articular facets that slope away from a dividing ridge. The lower facet is vertical; it articulates with the upper border of its own vertebra. The upper facet faces up to an overhanging facet on the lower border of the vertebra above. Each makes a synovial joint, and the cavities are separated by a ligament attached to the ridge on the head. The capsule and synovial membrane of each separate joint are attached to the articular margin. The head projects forward a little as it expands from the neck. The radiate ligament is attached here, to the front of the head, and the sympathetic trunk lies in contact (Fig. 4.3), plastered in position by the adherent parietal pleura. Ribs atypical as to the head are the first, eleventh and twelfth (and perhaps the tenth); each makes a single synovial joint, with only its own vertebra.</p>
<p>The neck is flattened, with the upper border curving up into a thin, prominent ridge, the crest. The two laminae of the superior costotransverse ligament are attached to the crest, whence they pass up to the transverse process of the vertebra above (Fig. 4.1). The costotransverse ligament (p. 243) is attached between the back of the neck and the transverse process of its own vertebra. The front of the neck is clad in pleura. The neck of the rib inclines backwards when traced from head to tubercle.</p>
<p>The tubercle shows two smooth facets (Fig. 4.38). In the anatomical position they lie medial and lateral. The medial facet is covered with hyaline cartilage and makes a synovial joint with the transverse process of its own vertebra. Its shape and direction vary in upper and lower levels as already noted. The joint capsule and synovial membrane are attached to the articular margin. The lateral facet, smooth-surfaced, receives the lateral costotransverse ligament from the tip of its own transverse process. Ribs atypical as to the tubercle are the eleventh and twelfth (sometimes the tenth); no synovial joint exists here, only the ligament, and usually there is no tubercle on the rib.</p>
<p>The shaft slopes down and back to the angle and there twists forward in its characteristic curvature. The upper border is blunt. It gives attachment in its whole length to the external intercostal muscle from the rib above. Deep to this the internal intercostal muscle arises from the upper border between the anterior extremity and the angle, while between angle and tubercle the internal intercostal membrane is attached. Deep to this layer the subcostal and innermost intercostals sweep across the internal surface of the shaft, some of the fibers attaching themselves to the upper border. Elsewhere the internal surface of the shaft is in contact with parietal pleura. The lower border of the shaft is sharp, especially lateral to the angle, where it hangs down to produce a well-marked costal groove. Further forward the costal groove dies away, and the lower border of the rib becomes blunt like the upper border. The external intercostal muscle arises from the sharp lower border and the internal intercostal is attached in front of the angle to the costal groove; anteriorly they are together attached to the blunt lower border. Between angle and tubercle the internal intercostal muscle is replaced by the posterior intercostal membrane. The neurovascular bundle lies just below its own rib, deep to the posterior intercostal membrane and muscle, high up in the space under shelter of the projecting sharp lower border of the rib. In front of the angle, the external surface of the shaft is bare, and serratus anterior plays over it on the upper eight ribs. The anterior end of the rib is excavated into a concave fossa; cancellous bone comes to the surface here. The fossa is plugged by the costal cartilage in an immovable primary cartilaginous joint.</p>
<p>The borders and pleural surface of this rib (Fig. 4.39) form part of the study of the thoracic cage, but its upper surface can be understood only when the anatomy of the root of the neck is known. The shaft is curved on the flat and, in conformity with the general convexity of the thoracic cage, the neck slopes down a little towards the head from the plane of the shaft. This can be seen, but if in doubt lay the rib on the table; head and anterior extremity both touch the surface. Laid upside down the neck slopes up to the head, which lies above the table. Thus can right and left sides be identified. Lift the rib from the table and study it in its anatomical position. The plane of the shaft is at 45°, and the tubercle is the most posterior and the highest part of the rib.</p>
<p>The head is small and carries a single facet for the synovial joint it makes with the upper part of the body of T1 vertebra. Capsule and synovial membrane are attached to the articular margin. A radiate ligament attached to the head reinforces the anterior part of the capsule. A slender neck slopes backwards and upwards to join the shaft. The anterior rami of nerves C8 (above) and T1 (below) lie in contact with the medial part of the neck. The sympathetic trunk (or cervicothoracic ganglion) lies in contact with the anterior border of the neck alongside the head. Lateral to it the supreme intercostal vein and then the superior intercostal artery lie in contact, and more lateral still the first thoracic nerve lies in front of the neck and inner border of the shaft (Fig. 4.5). The cervical dome of the pleura and the apex of the lung hold these vessels and nerves against the front of the neck of the rib.</p>
<p>and here a prominent tubercle projects back to form the most posterior convexity of the rib. It is a fusion of tubercle and angle. Medially it has a cylindrical facet for a corresponding concavity on the first transverse process. The usual synovial joint exists here, with capsule and synovial membrane attached to the articular margins. The lateral prominent part of the tubercle receives the lateral costotransverse ligament and the costalis and longissimus parts of erector spinae.</p>
<p>The under surface of the shaft, crossed obliquely by the small first intercostal nerve and vessels is covered by adherent parietal pleura. The external and internal intercostal muscles are attached together to the outer rim of this surface. Some undulations in the shaft often produce broad grooves that can be mistaken for the subclavian grooves on the upper surface; if the surfaces are reversed the rib will be allotted to the opposite side. This mistake can be avoided by remembering the slope of the neck already studied. The outer border is blunt between the tubercle and subclavian groove. The anterior end of this blunt part is at the most lateral part of the convexity of the rib; this gives origin to part of the first digitation of serratus anterior. The posterior end of the blunt border is bare bone, and here scalenus posterior slides across the rib deep to serratus anterior. Forward of the subclavian groove the sharp external border is encroached on by the external intercostal muscle. The concave internal border of the shaft gives attachment to the suprapleural membrane in front of the subclavian groove (Fig. 4.5).</p>
<p>The upper surface of the shaft, sloping down at 45°, is at the root of the neck. It is grooved obliquely at its greatest lateral convexity (Fig. 4.5). Called the groove for the subclavian artery, it lodges the lower trunk of the brachial plexus (Fig. 4.39). The fibers in contact with the rib are all T1, and the C8 fibers lie above them, not yet intermingled. Note the direction of the groove; prolonged backwards it leads up to the neck of the rib, along the line of T1 nerve. The subclavian artery has its upward convexity lying more transversely. The artery does not lie in the groove, and it touches only the outer border of the rib. Between the groove and the tubercle the large quadrangular area of the upper surface gives attachment to scalenus medius. At the front of the groove the inner border is projected into a spur, the scalene tubercle. The ribbon-like tendon of scalenus anterior is attached to the tubercle and extends along a ridge across the upper surface halfway to the external border. In front of the subclavian groove, down the slope of the rib, is a second groove in which the subclavian vein lies in contact with the bone. The anterior end of the shaft expands into a concavity for the first costal cartilage. From the upper surface of this junction subclavius arises from both bone and cartilage.</p>
<p>This has a more slender shaft, and it makes a much larger curvature than the first (Fig. 4.40). It lies with its head slightly above the table. In the anatomical position its concave surface faces inwards as well as downwards. It possesses an angle about 1.5 cm (½ in) from its tubercle. The angle, not the tubercle, is the most posterior part of its curvature. The most lateral part of the curve shows a characteristic bump - a rough tuberosity on the outer surface of the shaft, which in some bones resembles the callus of an old fracture. This is for the second and part of the first digitation of serratus anterior. Further back, about 3 cm (more than 1 in) lateral to the angle, the upper border is drawn up into a smaller bump for the attachment of scalenus posterior. The other features of the second rib are as those of a typical rib; the costal groove is present but poorly developed.</p>
<p>This is usually a typical rib, but is sometimes atypical in having a single facet for the head and no articular facet on the tubercle.</p>
<p>This has a single facet for the head and a short neck with no tubercle, but it retains a well-marked costal groove.</p>

In conformity with the barrel-shaped contour of the thoracic cage the concavity of the shaft looks up a little instead of directly inwards like the others. The head has a single facet for T12 vertebra; the capsule and synovial membrane are attached to the articular margins. A short constriction forms a neck which passes imperceptibly into the shaft. There is no tubercle, no angle and no costal groove. A wide area of ridges on the convex surface of the shaft shows the attachment of erector spinae; lateral to this external oblique and latissimus dorsi arise and diverge from each other. The thin upper part of quadratus lumborum is attached to the medial part of the lower border; its markings may be difficult to identify. It does not extend as far out as erector spinae. The upper ends of the anterior and middle layers of the lumbar fascia are attached to the rib around the muscle. At the lateral limit of quadratus (and one may have to guess where this is) the lateral arcuate ligament is attached. From here to the tip of the costal cartilage the diaphragm and transversus abdominis arise from the inner surface. From the diaphragm origin to the rib head the inner surface is clad by pleura which dips below the shaft in the costodiaphragmatic recess (p. 366). Lateral to quadratus the internal oblique is attached to the lower border. The external and internal intercostal muscles are attached along the upper border; there is commonly no posterior intercostal membrane in the eleventh intercostal space.</p>

<p>Cartilage is laid down in mesoderm at the sixth week and a bony center appears at the angle at the eighth week of fetal life. The head and tubercle remain cartilaginous and secondary centers appear at both places at about 15 years and fuse late (say 25 years).</p>
<h2 id="ossification-of-the-sternum">
  Ossification of the Sternum
  <a class="anchor" href="#ossification-of-the-sternum">#</a>
</h2>
<p>In two longitudinal cartilaginous plates that fuse in the midline, a variable number of primary centers appear at about the fifth fetal month and later. There are one or two in the manubrium, and one or two in each of the four pieces (sternebrae) that will form the body of the sternum. The double centers coalesce, and fusion between sternebrae occurs between puberty and 25 years. Sternal foramina (bullet holes) in the adult sternum are the result of incomplete fusion of double centers. The cartilaginous xiphoid process may ossify any time after the third year but often not until later life.</p>
<h2 id="costal-cartilages">
  Costal Cartilages
  <a class="anchor" href="#costal-cartilages">#</a>
</h2>
<p>These form primary cartilaginous joints at the extremities of all twelve ribs. The first is short and thick, and forms also a primary cartilaginous joint with the manubrium. It articulates with the clavicle and gives attachment to the sternoclavicular disc and joint capsule and, lateral to this, the costoclavicular ligament. The suprapleural membrane is attached to its upper border.</p>
<p>Below this the cartilages increase in length down to the seventh, which is the longest. From the fifth to the tenth they are bent from a downward slope in line with the rib to an upward slope towards the sternum (Fig. 4.3). Their medial ends form synovial joints (p. 243). On the eleventh and twelfth ribs there is a pointed tip of cartilage. All cartilages, especially the first, tend to calcify and even ossify in patches after middle age. The costal cartilages give attachment to the anterior intercostal membranes and the internal intercostal muscles of their spaces, and the lower six give origin to the diaphragm and transversus abdominis from their inner surfaces. The attachments of transversus thoracis behind the second to sixth, and of pectoralis major in front of the upper six costal cartilages have already been noted.</p>
