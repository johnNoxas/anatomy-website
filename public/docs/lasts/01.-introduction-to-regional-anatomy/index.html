There are, of course, different kinds of these tissues depending on the differing functional requirements of the various organs and parts of the body, and the details of cell types and intercellular substances are dealt with in texts on histology. This chapter brings together some notes on certain body tissues and structures to form a relevant introduction to regional anatomy.</p><p>Skin consists of two elements: epithelium and connective tissue. The epithelium of the skin, which is given the special name of epidermis, is of the stratified squamous keratinizing variety. The various skin appendages—sebaceous glands, sweat glands, nails and hair—are specialized derivatives of this epidermis, which is ectodermal in origin. The connective tissue part of the skin, which is mesodermal in origin, is the dermis, consisting mainly of bundles of collagen fibres together with some elastic tissue, blood vessels, lymphatics and nerve fibres, all embedded in ground substance. When dried, the dermis makes greenhide; when tanned, it makes leather.</p><p>The uppermost layer of the epidermis is the stratum corneum (Fig. 1.1), the cornified or horny layer, consisting of dead cells (keratin) that have lost their nuclei and that are constantly being rubbed off and replaced by cells moving up from deeper layers. In the scalp, scaly flakes of the horny layer may be trapped by hairs instead of falling off invisibly, so forming dandruff.</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.1</strong> Sections of thick skin, on the left, and thin skin on the right. The definition of thick and thin depends on the thickness of the keratinized layer; the overall depth of the combined epidermis and dermis is the same.</p><p>The horny layer is normally softened by the greasy secretion of sebaceous glands and moistened somewhat by the watery secretion of the sweat glands. Fat solvents or emulsifiers remove the grease and leave the horny layer stiff and harsh. Undue contact with water macerates the keratin which, by imbibition, becomes thick, soft and white (washerwoman&rsquo;s fingers).</p><p>The terms thick skin and thin skin refer to the thickness of the cornified layer (Fig. 1.1). In thick skin, such as on the sole of the foot, the stratum corneum is thick and paradoxically the dermis is relatively thin. In thin skin, such as on the front of the forearm, the stratum corneum is thin but the dermis relatively thick.</p><p>While partly due to its thickness and blood flow, the main factor determining the colour of skin is the degree of pigmentation produced by melanocytes which are mainly found in the basal layer of the epidermis. These cells manufacture melanin granules which are liberated from the melanocytes and ingested by other epidermal cells; thus the presence of melanin granules within a cell does not necessarily imply that the cell has.</p><p>Skin contains about 3 million sweat glands, which are distributed all over the skin except on the margins of the lips, glans penis and tympanic membranes. The greatest concentration is in the thick skin of the palms and soles, and on the face including the forehead. Structurally they resemble coiled test-tubes that extend below the dermis into the subcutaneous tissue, with ducts that are reasonably straight as they pass through the dermis but which pursue a spiral, corkscrew-like course through the epidermis. There are two types of gland—eccrine and apocrine—although the mode of secretion is the same in both. The vast majority are eccrine glands whose purpose is to deliver water to the body surface and so assist in temperature regulation, although those on the palms, soles and forehead respond to emotional stress—as is well known to students in oral examinations! The apocrine glands are larger and confined to the axillae, areolae of the breasts and urogenital regions (breasts themselves are modified apocrine glands). They correspond to the scent glands of animals where they are important for recognition in the breeding season, and even in humans they are under the control of sex hormones, becoming active at puberty. Their ducts, like those of sebaceous glands (see below), open into hair follicles. Although human apocrine secretion is odourless, it may make its presence felt because of the action of skin surface bacteria which degrade it into less appreciated by-products.</p><p>Sebaceous glands are usually confined to hairy skin where they open by a very short duct into the side of a hair follicle; only in a few sites do they open directly on to the skin surface—eyelids, lips, papillae of the breasts and labia minora. There are none on the palms or soles. Structurally the glands form a grape-like cluster beside a hair follicle.</p><p>Hair: the keratin of the skin surface is soft keratin, but hair and nails are a hard type of keratin. There is no new development of hair follicles after birth. Each hair is formed from the hair matrix, a region of epidermal cells at the base of the hair follicle. As the cells move up inside the tubular epidermal sheath of the follicle they soon lose their nuclei and become converted into the hard keratin rod that is the hair. Melanocytes in the hair matrix impart pigment to the hair cells. The differing colours of hair are due to a mixture of three kinds of pigment. The change with age is due to decreasing melanocyte activity. Most follicles have an arrector pili muscle attached to the connective tissue of the base of the follicle and passing obliquely to the upper part of the dermis. Composed of smooth muscle with a sympathetic innervation, it is on the same side of the follicle as the sebaceous gland, so that when contracting to make the hair stand on end, it may also squeeze the gland.</p><p>Hair follicles do not grow continually, and growth periods vary in different sites. Those on the scalp have a growing phase of 2–3 years followed by a few months in a resting phase, during which time the hair becomes detached from the base of the follicle and falls out before the matrix starts to make a new hair. Adjacent follicles are out of phase with one another so that the constant renewal and replacement are not obvious. In the eyebrows the growing phase is only a month or two, with a longer resting period.</p><p>Nails: a finger- or toe-nail is formed from a nail matrix, a similar epidermal specialization to hair matrices.</p><p>Surface area: in skin damage by burns, an estimate of the affected surface area is important in assessing the need for fluid replacement therapy, and the Rule of Nines gives a guide to the size of body parts in proportion to the whole: head 9%; upper limb 9%; lower limb 18%; front of thorax and abdomen 18%; back of thorax and abdomen 18%.</p><p>Tension lines and wrinkle lines of skin, due to the pattern of fibre bundles in the dermis, run as indicated in Figure 1.2. Skin creases such as those near joints run parallel with tension lines, but they and the wrinkles of ageing do not necessarily correspond to the cleavage lines originally described by Langer in 1861. Incisions made along creases and wrinkle lines heal with a minimum of scarring; hence incisions should preferably not be made across these lines, and certainly never across the flexure creases on the flexor surfaces of joints.</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.2</strong> Tension lines of the skin, front and back.</p><p>The skin is connected to the underlying bones or deep fascia by a layer of areolar tissue that varies widely in character in different species. In hairy mammals it is loose and tenuous with a minimum of fat, so that it is a simple matter to skin the animal. In others, including man, fat is plentiful and fibrous bands in the fat tether the skin to the deep fascia. Such an animal is more difficult to skin; it has a blanket of fat beneath the skin, called the panniculus adiposus. The panniculus adiposus is well developed in man, and in it nerves, blood vessels and lymphatics pass to the skin. The panniculus adiposus is a substitute for a fur coat in hairless mammals (e.g. man, pig, cetacea).</p><p>The term superficial fascia is so ingrained in nomenclature that there is no hope of discarding it. Yet the tissue bears no possible resemblance to the other so-called deep fasciae, and the names panniculus adiposus, subcutaneous tissue or subcutaneous fat are greatly to be preferred.</p><p>In the panniculus adiposus are flat sheets of muscle, the panniculus carnosus. The degree of their development varies widely in different animals. In domestic quadrupeds such as sheep and horses the sheet is present over most of the body wall. It can be seen on the carcass in a butcher&rsquo;s shop, lying on the surface of the fat, generally incised in parallel slits to make an attractive pattern. It can be seen in action when a horse twitches the skin over its withers. The essential point about the panniculus carnosus is that one end of each muscle fibre is attached to the skin, the other end being usually attached to deep fascia or bone.</p><p>In man the sheet is well developed and highly differentiated to form the muscles of the scalp and face including the platysma, and remnants persist in such subcutaneous muscles as the palmaris brevis and as unstriped muscle in the corrugator cutis ani, in the dartos sheet of the scrotum and in the subareolar muscle of the nipple.</p><p>The limbs and body wall are wrapped in a membrane of fibrous tissue, the deep fascia. It varies widely in thickness. In the iliotibial tract of the fascia lata, for example, it is very well developed, while over the rectus sheath and external oblique aponeurosis of the abdominal wall it is so thin as to be scarcely demonstrable and is usually considered to be absent. In other parts, such as the face and the ischioanal fossa, it is entirely absent. A feature of the deep fascia of the body and limbs is that it never passes freely over bone but is always anchored firmly to the periosteum. A pin thrust into a muscle will pass through skin, subcutaneous tissue and deep fascia; one thrust into a subcutaneous bone will pass through skin, panniculus adiposus and periosteum only (Fig. 1.3).</p><p>The deep fascia serves for attachment of the skin by way of fibrous strands in the subcutaneous tissue. In a few places it gives attachment to underlying muscles, but almost everywhere in the body the muscles are free to glide beneath it as they lengthen and shorten.</p><p>Deep fascia is very sensitive. Its nerve supply, and that of subcutaneous periosteum where no deep fascia exists, is that of the overlying skin. The nerves to muscles do not supply the investing layer of deep fascia, but only the fibrous tissue of deep intermuscular spaces, and deep periosteum.</p><p>As well as the investing layer of deep fascia on the surface of the body there are many other fascial layers in deeper parts, of widely differing character. In general it may be said that where fasciae lie over non-expansile parts (e.g. muscles of the pelvic wall, prevertebral muscles) they are well developed membranes readily demonstrable, able to be sutured after incision; but where they lie over expansile parts (e.g. muscles of the pelvic floor, cheek, pharynx) they are indefinite and thin collections of loose areolar tissue, nothing more nor less than the epimysium of the underlying muscle (p. 5).</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.3</strong> Deep fascia blending with periosteum in a transverse section of the tibia.</p><h2 id=ligaments>LIGAMENTS
<a class=anchor href=#ligaments>#</a></h2><p>Ligaments are composed of dense connective tissue, mainly collagen fibres (white fibrous tissue) and they attach bone to bone. They have the physical property of being non-elastic and unstretchable. Only if subjected to prolonged strain will collagen fibres elongate, and undue mobility is then possible in the joints (e.g. in flat feet, contortionists). White fibrous tissue ligaments are so arranged that they are never subjected to prolonged strain, with the curious exception of the sacroiliac ligaments and the intervertebral discs, which are never free from the strain of the whole weight of the body except in recumbency.</p><p>A second type of ligament is composed of elastic tissue, which regains its former length after stretching. It is yellow in colour, hence the name of the ligamenta flava between the laminae of the vertebrae. The capsular ligaments of the joints of the auditory ossicles are made of yellow elastic tissue.</p><h2 id=tendons>TENDONS
<a class=anchor href=#tendons>#</a></h2><p>Tendons have a similar structure to collagenous ligaments, and attach muscle to bone. They may be cylindrical or flat; even if flattened into sheet-like aponeuroses the histological structure is the same. Tendons have a blood supply from vessels which descend from the muscle belly and anastomose with vessels ascending from the periosteum at the bony attachment. In long tendons intermediate vessels from a neighbouring artery reinforce the longitudinal anastomosis.</p><h2 id=synovial-sheaths>Synovial sheaths
<a class=anchor href=#synovial-sheaths>#</a></h2><p>Where tendons bear heavily on adjacent structures, and especially where they pass around loops or pulleys of fibrous tissue or bone which change the direction of their pull, they are lubricated by being provided with a synovial sheath. The parietal layer of the sheath is firmly attached to the surrounding structures, the visceral layer is firmly fixed to the tendon, and the two layers glide on each other, lubricated by a thin film of synovial fluid secreted by the lining cells of the sheath. The visceral and parietal layers join each other. Usually they do not enclose the tendon cylindrically; it is as though the tendon were pushed into the double layers of the closed sheath from one side (Fig. 1.4). In this way blood vessels can enter the tendon to reinforce the longitudinal anastomosis. In other cases blood vessels perforate the sheath and raise up a synovial fold like a little mesentery—mesotendon or vinculum—as in the flexor tendons of the digits (Fig. 2.54C, p. 118).</p><h2 id=raphes>RAPHES
<a class=anchor href=#raphes>#</a></h2><p>A raphe is an interdigitation of the short tendinous ends of fibres of flat muscle sheets. It can be elongated passively by separation of its attached ends. There is, for example, no such structure as a pterygomandibular ligament; if there were, the mandible would be fixed, since ligaments do not stretch. The buccinator and superior constrictor interdigitate in the pterygomandibular raphe, the length of which varies with the position of the mandible. The mylohyoid raphe, pharyngeal raphe and anococcygeal raphe are further examples.</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.4</strong> Arterial supply to a long tendon, with the vessel passing through a gap in the synovial sheath.</p><p>Cartilage is a type of dense connective tissue in which cells and fibres are embedded in a firm ground substance or matrix, and there are three types. The commonest is hyaline cartilage, which covers the articular surfaces of typical synovial joints and forms the epiphyseal growth plates of growing bones. The usual histological sections of cartilage give no idea of the amount of collagen fibres that it contains, because the fibres and ground substance both have the same refractive index. Unlike bone, cartilage is avascular and capable of a small amount of deformation; it therefore has a certain resistance to fracture, but when it is damaged it is usually repaired by the formation of fibrous tissue, not new cartilage. However, there are circumstances in which new cartilage can develop, not from surviving cartilage cells but by the differentiation of osteochondrogenic cells—the name sometimes now given to cells of the osteogenic layer of the periosteum which appear capable of becoming osteoblasts or chondroblasts depending on the vascularity of the area (p. 9).</p><p>Fibrocartilage resembles ligament and tendon but contains small islands of cartilage cells and ground substance between the collagen bundles. It is found in intervertebral discs and the discs or disc-like structures of some joints, such as the labrum of the shoulder and hip joints and the menisci of the knee joint. It also occurs on the articular surfaces of the clavicle and mandible, and at those attachment sites of tendon to bone epiphyses, which leave a smooth marking on the bone. Both hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage tend to calcify and even ossify in old age.</p><p>The third type, elastic cartilage (epiglottis and pinna), has a ground substance that contains large numbers of elastic fibres. It can be easily distorted, and just as easily springs back to its original shape when at rest. It is functionally ideal for the skeletal framework of the human pinna, the auditory tube and the epiglottis. It never calcifies or ossifies.</p><p>Fibrocartilage has an ordinary blood supply (rather sparse because its metabolic rate is low) but hyaline and elastic cartilage have no capillaries, their cells being nourished by diffusion through the ground substance.</p><p>There are three kinds of muscle—skeletal, cardiac and visceral—although the basic histological classification is into two types: striated and non-striated. This is because both skeletal and cardiac muscle are striated, a structural characteristic due to the way the filaments of actin and myosin are arranged. The term striated muscle is usually taken to mean skeletal muscle. Visceral muscle is non-striated and so is usually called smooth muscle (although it too contains filaments of actin and myosin, but they are arranged differently). The terms muscle cell and muscle fibre are the same thing. Smooth and cardiac muscle fibres, like most cells, usually have a single nucleus, but skeletal muscle fibres are multinucleated cells; in fibres that are several centimetres long there are thousands of nuclei, characteristically situated just beneath the cell membrane.</p><p>Smooth muscle consists of narrow spindle-shaped cells usually lying parallel. In tubes that undergo peristalsis they are arranged in longitudinal and circular fashion (as in the alimentary canal and ureter). In viscera that undergo a mass contraction without peristalsis (such as urinary bladder and uterus) the fibres are arranged in whorls and spirals rather than demonstrable layers. Contractile impulses are transmitted from one cell to another at sites called nexuses or gap junctions, where adjacent cell membranes lie unusually close together. Innervation is by autonomic nerves and because of the gap junctions many muscle fibres do not receive nerve fibres.</p><p>Cardiac muscle consists of much broader, shorter cells that branch. Part of the boundary membranes of adjacent cells make very elaborate interdigitations with one another (at the intercalated discs of light microscopy) to increase the surface area for impulse conduction. The cells are arranged in whorls and spirals; each chamber of the heart empties by mass contraction, not peristalsis. Innervation, like that of visceral muscle, is by autonomic nerves.</p><p>Skeletal muscle (the red meat of the butcher) consists of non-branching fibres bound together by loose areolar tissue containing the usual complement of cells such as fibroblasts and macrophages. This connective tissue is condensed like the skin of a sausage on the surface of all muscles, forming a membrane of varying thickness and density well known to every dissector; it is the material dissected away and discarded in the process of cleaning a muscle for demonstration purposes. The membranous envelope, or epimysium, is impervious to the spread of fluid such as pus. It is seldom of such a nature as to warrant special description as a named fascia, but one such in the neck is the buccopharyngeal fascia (p. 488).</p><p>Skeletal muscle fibres can be shown by histochemical and other means to be of two types, often called red and white, and, while in animals there are some whole skeletal muscles which consist of a single type, all human muscles are a mixture of both types and all appear red, although one type may predominate. The red fibres, slow twitch in physiological terms with aerobic respiration, have a high content of mitochondria, myoglobin, succinic dehydrogenase and other oxidative enzymes, and low myosin ATPase. White fibres, fast twitch and anaerobic, are characterized by the reverse of the above features and have a high glycogen and phosphorylase content. The fibres of a single motor unit (the fibres supplied by the branches of a single neuron) are all of the same type, but if the nerve supply is altered (as by regeneration of nerve fibres after injury) the type becomes altered. In contrast to smooth and cardiac muscle, each individual skeletal muscle fibre receives a motor nerve fibre.</p><p>Embedded among the ordinary skeletal muscle cells are groups of up to about 10 small specialized muscle fibres that constitute the muscle spindles. The spindle fibres are held together as a group by a connective tissue capsule and hence are called intrafusal fibres (lying within a cigar-shaped or fusiform capsule), in contrast to ordinary skeletal muscles fibres which can be called extrafusal. Muscle spindles are constant in position in any given muscle and are most numerous (relative to the muscle bulk) in muscles concerned with fine movements (e.g. 368 in latissimus dorsi, 80 in abductor pollicis brevis). The intrafusal fibres are innervated by the γ motor neurons of the anterior horn, in contrast to ordinary (extrafusal) fibres which receive their motor supply from the large α cells. Spindles act as one type of sensory receptor, transmitting to the central nervous system information on the state of contraction of the muscles in which they lie. The afferent fibres (types Ia and II, p. 17) come from primary (annulospiral) and secondary (flowerspray) endings which wrap themselves round parts of the spindle cells.</p><h2 id=skeletal-muscles>SKELETAL MUSCLES
<a class=anchor href=#skeletal-muscles>#</a></h2><p>The disposition of the individual fibres in a muscle can be in one of only two ways, namely, parallel or oblique to the line of pull of the whole muscle. In the former, maximum range of mobility is assured; in the latter, the range of mobility is less but increased force of pull of the muscle is correspondingly gained. A good example of a muscle with parallel fibres is provided by sartorius. In flexing the knee and hip and laterally rotating the hip, the muscle is contracted to its shortest length; reversing the movements elongates the muscle by 30%. Other examples of muscles with parallel fibres are rectus abdominis, the infrahyoid group, the extrinsic eye muscles, the anterior and posterior fibres of deltoid, the flank muscles of the abdomen, and the intercostals.</p><p>Muscles whose fibres lie oblique to the line of pull of the whole muscle fall into several patterns:</p><p>(1) Unipennate muscles. The tendon forms along one margin of the muscle and all the fibres slope into one side of the tendon, giving a pattern like a feather split longitudinally. A good example is flexor pollicis longus.</p><p>(2) Bipennate muscles. The tendon forms centrally, usually as a fibrous septum which enlarges distally to form the tendon proper. Muscle fibres slope into the two sides of the central tendon, like an ordinary feather. An example is rectus femoris (in which muscle the fibres slope upwards towards the central septum).</p><p>(3) Multipennate muscles. These are of two varieties: a series of bipennate masses lying side by side, as in the acromial fibres of deltoid, subscapularis, etc.; and a cylindrical muscle within which a central tendon forms. Into the central tendon the sloping fibres of the muscle converge from all sides. An example is the tibialis anterior. A further variety, unique, is provided by soleus. The main bulk of this powerful muscle consists of short fibres that slope between two aponeuroses, downwards from the deep to the superficial.</p><p>In a muscle whose fibres run parallel with its line of pull, a given shortening of muscle fibres results in equal shortening of the whole muscle. In unipennate and multipennate muscles, a given shortening of muscle fibres results in less shortening of the whole muscle. The loss of shortening is compensated by a corresponding gain in force of pull. Obliquity of pull of a contracting fibre involves a loss of mechanical efficiency. But the number of oblique fibres is much greater than the number of longitudinal fibres required to fill the volume of a long muscle belly. The greater number of oblique fibres, though each fibre loses some efficiency, results in an overall gain of power in the muscle as a whole. Such muscles are found where great power and less range of movement are needed.</p><p>Some muscles are wholly fleshy, some largely aponeurotic, while many have a quite characteristic mixture of the two. Such variations provide an illustration of the relation of form to function. If the surface of a muscle bears heavily on an adjacent structure it will be covered by a glistening aponeurosis; where there is no pressure there is usually flesh. Examples are manifold, and in this book the surface appearances of many muscles are described. Here rectus femoris may be cited as a good example. The anterior surface of this bipennate muscle is fleshy where it lies beneath the fascia lata, being aponeurotic only at its upper end, where it plays against a fibrofatty pad that separates it from sartorius. Its deep surface is exactly the reverse. At the upper end is flesh, but the remainder of the posterior surface is wholly aponeurotic, where the muscle plays heavily on a corresponding aponeurosis of the anterior surface of vastus intermedius. The advantage of knowing the surface characteristics of muscles should be obvious to both physician and surgeon. For the physician, for example, the diagnosis of rheumatic pain or tenderness will often hinge on whether the site is over aponeurosis or flesh, for where there is an aponeurosis there is a bursa. Such bursae are often very extensive and are usually open at one end, so that effused fluid never distends them, but a dry inflammation comparable to dry pleurisy will produce pain on movement and tenderness on pressure over these aponeuroses. The surgeon sees muscles far more often than bones, and instant recognition of a muscle by its surface appearance gives great confidence and accuracy at operation.</p><h2 id=origins-and-insertions>Origins and insertions
<a class=anchor href=#origins-and-insertions>#</a></h2><p>There is no reality in these terms, though the sanctity of long usage forces their continued use. Attachment seems the best alternative for both origin and insertion, and is rightly gaining in popularity. The upper attachment is usually the origin and the lower attachment the insertion, but sometimes the lower end is considered the origin (rectus abdominis, popliteus). But which end of a muscle remains fixed and which end moves depends on circumstances and varies with most muscles.</p><p>The insertion of a tendon when, as usually, it is near a joint, is almost always into the epiphysis. An exception is the tendon of adductor magnus, the insertion of which into the adductor tubercle is bisected by the epiphyseal line of the femur.</p><h2 id=bone-markings>Bone markings
<a class=anchor href=#bone-markings>#</a></h2><p>Fleshy origins generally leave no mark on the bone, though often the area is flattened or depressed and thus visible on the dried bone (e.g. pectoralis major on the clavicle). Contrary to usual teaching, insertions of pure tendon, like the attachments of ligaments, almost always leave a smooth mark on the bone, though the area may be raised into a plateau or depressed into a fossa (spinati, tibialis anterior, patellar ligament, cruciate ligaments on femur, psoas, obturator tendons on femur, etc.). Rough marks are made where there is an admixture of flesh and tendon, or where there is a lengthy insertion of aponeurosis (e.g. ulnar tuberosity, gluteal crest, linea aspera).</p><p>A characteristic of flat muscles that arise from flat bones and play over their surfaces is that the muscle origin does not extend to the edge of the flat bone. The origin of the muscle is set back from the edge of the bone in a curved line. Between the edge of the bone and the curved line is a bare area, over which the contracting muscle slides. This allows a greater range of movement of the contracting muscle fibres. The bare area is invariably occupied by a bursa, and such bursae are always of large size. The bursa may communicate with the nearby joint (e.g. subscapularis, iliacus) in which case infection of one cavity necessarily involves the other. Some of these bursae remain separate from the nearby joint (e.g. supraspinatus, usually infraspinatus, obturator internus). The temporalis muscle is an exception to this rule, for its fibres arise from the whole of the temporal fossa down to the infratemporal crest, and there is no bursa beneath it.</p><h2 id=muscle-action>Muscle action
<a class=anchor href=#muscle-action>#</a></h2><p>Movements are the result of the co-ordinated activity of many muscles, usually assisted or otherwise by gravity. Bringing the attachments of a muscle (origin and insertion) closer together is what is conventionally described as the action of a muscle (isotonic contraction, shortening it). If this is the desired movement the muscle is said to be acting as a prime mover, as when biceps is required to flex the elbow. A muscle producing the opposite of the desired movement—triceps in this example—is acting as an antagonist; it is relaxing but in a suitably controlled manner to assist the prime mover. Two other classes of action are described: fixators and synergists. Fixators stabilize one attachment of a muscle so that the other end may move, e.g. muscles holding the scapula steady are acting as fixators when deltoid moves the humerus. Synergists prevent unwanted movement; the long flexors of the fingers pass across the wrist joint before reaching the fingers, and if finger flexion is the required movement, muscles such as flexor and extensor carpi ulnaris act as synergists to stabilize the wrist so that the finger flexors can act on the fingers. A muscle that acts as a prime mover for one activity can of course act as an antagonist, fixator or synergist at other times. Muscles can also contract isometrically, with increase of tension but the length remaining the same. They can be assisted by gravity, and may contract paradoxically, as in paying out rope, e.g. when biceps (a flexor) controls extension of the elbow. Many muscles can be seen and felt during contraction, and this is the usual way of assessing their activity, but sometimes more specialized tests such as electrical stimulation and electromyography may be required.</p><p>Muscles have a rich blood supply. The arteries and veins usually pierce the surface in company with the motor nerve. From the muscle belly vessels pass to supply the adjoining tendon. Lymphatics run back with the arteries to regional lymph nodes.</p><p>Skeletal muscle is supplied by somatic nerves (p. 16) through one or more motor branches which (in spinal nerves) also contain afferent and autonomic fibres. The efferent fibres in spinal nerves are the axons of the large α anterior horn cells of the spinal cord which pass to extrafusal fibres, and of the small γ cells which supply the spindle (intrafusal) fibres (p. 6). The motor nuclei of cranial nerves provide the axons for those skeletal muscles supplied by cranial nerves. The pathways for neuromuscular control are considered on page 623.</p><p>The flat muscles of the body wall are perforated by cutaneous nerves on their way to the skin. Such nerves do not necessarily supply the muscles. However, in the limbs it is a fact that whenever a nerve pierces a muscle it supplies that muscle, and the motor branch leaves the nerve proximal to the muscle. As a matter of morphological fact, limb nerves do not pierce muscles at all, but pass actually in planes between distinct morphological masses that have fused together. Whenever a nerve pierces a muscle, suspect a morphological pitfall (e.g. coracobrachialis, supinator, sternocleidomastoid).</p><p>Note that all muscles in a limb are supplied by branches of the limb plexus, and that flexor muscles derive their nerve supply from anterior divisions and extensor muscles from posterior divisions of the nerves of the plexus (p. 21).</p><p>The nerve to a muscle in the body wall or in a limb contains some 40% of afferent fibres. These innervate muscle spindles and mediate proprioceptive impulses. They are indispensable to properly co-ordinated muscle contraction.</p><p>The nerves supplying the ocular and facial muscles (third, fourth, sixth and seventh cranial nerves) contain no sensory fibres. Proprioceptive impulses are conveyed from the muscles by local branches of the trigeminal nerve. The spinal part of the accessory nerve and the hypoglossal nerve likewise contains no sensory fibres. Proprioceptive impulses are conveyed from sternocleidomastoid by C2 and 3 and from the trapezius by C3 and 4, and from the tongue muscles probably by the lingual nerve (from the trigeminal).</p><p>Sensory pathways form an essential background to coordinated voluntary movements. They mediate proprioceptive information from the muscle, its tendon, and the capsule and ligaments of the joint being acted upon. These pathways are stimulated in the clinical investigation of tendon reflexes (p. 28).</p><p>Bone is a type of dense connective tissue with cells and fibres embedded in a calcified ground substance commonly called bone matrix. For a tissue that seems so dense and hard perhaps one of its most surprising features is its vascularity. The cells of hyaline cartilage, and indeed of other connective tissues, obtain their nutrition by diffusion through the surrounding intercellular substance, but the cells of bone, lying in their calcified matrix through which diffusion is impossible, have been deprived of this facility. A system of minute channels therefore developed in bone matrix so that each osteocyte (bone cell) can still receive nutritive substances. The smallest channels are the bone canaliculi which communicate with larger spaces, the Haversian canals, containing the blood capillaries from which plasma can diffuse. During bone development the matrix is laid down in concentric layers (lamellae) around the capillaries. Volkmann&rsquo;s canals are channels that usually run at right angles to the Haversian canals and contain anastomosing vessels between Haversian capillaries.</p><p>Macroscopically bone exists in two forms, compact and cancellous. Compact bone is hard and dense, and resembles ivory, for which it is often substituted in the arts. True ivory is dentine. Cancellous bone consists of a spongework of trabeculae, arranged not haphazardly but in a very real pattern best adapted to resist the local strains and stresses. If for any reason there is an alteration in the strain to which cancellous bone is subjected there is a rearrangement of the trabeculae. The moulding of bone results from the resorption of existing bone by phagocytic osteoclasts and the deposition of new bone by osteoblasts; but it is not known how these activities are controlled and co-ordinated. Although adult bone exists in both cancellous and compact forms, there is no microscopic difference between the two.</p><p>The marrow cavity in long bones and the interstices of cancellous bone are filled with marrow, red or yellow as the case may be. This marrow apparently has nothing whatever to do with the bone itself, being merely stored there for convenience. At birth all the marrow of all the bones is red, active haemopoiesis going on everywhere. As age advances the red marrow atrophies and is replaced by yellow, fatty marrow, with no power of haemopoiesis. This change begins in the distal parts of the limbs and gradually progresses proximally. By young adult life there is little red marrow remaining in the limb bones, and that only in their cancellous ends; ribs, sternum, vertebrae and skull bones contain red marrow throughout life.</p><h2 id=periosteum-and-endosteum>Periosteum and endosteum
<a class=anchor href=#periosteum-and-endosteum>#</a></h2><p>The outer surfaces of bones are covered with a thick layer of fibrous tissue, in the deeper parts of which the blood vessels run. This layer is the periosteum and the nutrition of the underlying bone substance depends on the integrity of its blood vessels. The periosteum is itself osteogenic, its deeper cells differentiating into osteoblasts when required; hence the deeper part is known as the osteogenic layer. In the growing individual new bone is laid down under the periosteum, and even after growth has ceased the periosteum retains the power to produce new bone when it is needed, e.g. in the repair of fractures. The periosteum is united to the underlying bone by Sharpey&rsquo;s fibres, particularly strongly over the attachments of tendons and ligaments. Periosteum does not, of course, cover the articulating surfaces of the bones in synovial joints; it is reflected from the articular margins, to join the capsule of the joint.</p><p>The single-layered endosteum that lines inner bone surfaces (marrow cavity and vascular canals) is also osteogenic and contributes to new bone formation. The mass of inflammatory tissue and bone-forming cells at a fracture site constitutes the fracture callus, and it is more accurate to refer to osteogenic cells as osteochondrogenic: in a well-vascularized area they are indeed osteogenic and produce new bone, but in areas that become avascular the cells are chondrogenic and form hyaline cartilage. Excessive cartilage formation instead of bone is characteristic of fracture sites that remain mobile.</p><p>Subcutaneous periosteum is supplied by the nerves of the overlying skin. In deeper parts the local nerves, usually the motor branches to nearby muscles, provide the supply. Periosteum in all parts of the body is very sensitive.</p><p>In the adult the nutrient artery of the shaft of a long bone usually supplies little more than the bone marrow. The compact bone of the shaft and the cancellous bone of the ends are supplied by branches from the periosteum, especially numerous beneath muscular and ligamentous attachments. Before union with the shaft an epiphysis is supplied from the circulus vasculosus of the joint (p. 12). Veins are numerous and large in the cancellous red marrow bones (e.g. the basivertebral veins) and run with the arteries in Volkmann&rsquo;s canals in compact bone. Lymphatics are present, but scanty; they drain to the regional lymph nodes of the part.</p><h2 id=development>Development
<a class=anchor href=#development>#</a></h2><p>Bone develops by two main processes, intramembranous and endochondral ossification (ossification in membrane and cartilage). In general the bones of the vault of the skull, the face and the clavicle ossify in membrane, while the long bones of the skeleton ossify in cartilage.</p><p>In intramembranous ossification, osteoblasts simply lay down bone in fibrous tissue; there is no cartilage precursor. As well as the bones of the skull vault, face and the clavicle, it should be noted that growth in the thickness of other bones (subperiosteal ossification) is also by intramembranous ossification.</p><p>In endochondral ossification a pre-existing hyaline cartilage model of the bone is gradually destroyed and replaced by bone (Fig. 1.5). Most bones are formed in this way. It is essential to appreciate that the cartilage is not converted into bone; it is destroyed and then replaced by bone. During all the years of growth there is constant remodelling with destruction (by osteoclasts) and replacement (by osteoblasts), whether the original development was intramembranous or endochondral. Similarly endochondral ossification, subperiosteal ossification and remodelling occurs in the callus of fracture sites (see above).</p><p>The site where bone first forms is the primary centre of ossification, and in long bones is in the middle of the shaft (diaphysis), the centre first appearing about the eighth week of intrauterine life. The ends of the bone (epiphyses) remain cartilaginous and only acquire ossification centres much later, usually after birth. The dates of commencement of ossification in epiphyses (secondary centres of ossification) and of their fusion with the diaphysis were much loved of the older anatomists (and examiners). Although students are no longer required to memorize long lists of dates, which in any case are rather variable, it is still important in radiographs of the young and adolescent to be able to recognize the sites of epiphyseal lines (where an epiphyseal plate of cartilage remains between epiphysis and diaphysis) in order to distinguish them from fracture lines.</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.5</strong> Endochondral ossification in the epiphysis at the end of a long bone.</p><h2 id=secondary-cartilage>Secondary cartilage
<a class=anchor href=#secondary-cartilage>#</a></h2><p>This is the name given to a special type of cartilage that develops in certain growing membrane bones (head of the mandible and the ends of the clavicle). Both these bones are primarily ossified in membrane. Their articular surfaces are covered with fibrocartilage, identical with the intra-articular disc in structure. Between the bundles of fibrous tissue are many cells. At some distance beneath the articular surface the cells divide, enlarge, and come to lie close together in a groundwork of cartilage that contains many fibres. This secondary cartilage differs in appearance from hyaline cartilage in that its cells are larger and more tightly packed and the matrix is much more fibrous (Fig. 1.6). The secondary cartilage in the neck of the mandible persists until growth of the mandible is complete. It is rather like the epiphysis at the end of a long bone, but unlike the clavicle it has no secondary centre of ossification.</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.6</strong> Ossification in secondary cartilage, as in the head of the mandible.</p><p>(see below). It provides a cartilage surface for membrane bones that would otherwise have no cartilaginous ends.</p><p>Sesamoid bones (meaning seed-like) are usually associated with certain tendons where they glide over an adjacent bone. They may be fibrous, cartilaginous or bony nodules, or a mixture of all three, and their presence is variable. The only constant examples are the patella, which is by far the largest, and the one in each of the two tendons of flexor pollicis brevis in the hand and the foot. Occasional sesamoids in the hand may be found in any of the flexor tendons in front of the metacarpophalangeal joints. In the foot they can occur as in the hand flexor tendons, and other possible sites include the peroneus longus tendon over the cuboid, the tibialis anterior tendon against the medial cuneiform, the tibialis posterior tendon opposite the head of the talus, in any of the tendons at the medial and lateral malleoli, and one in the lateral head of gastrocnemius (where it is known as the fabella, an example not associated with tendon). The reasons for the presence of sesamoids are obscure. Sometimes they appear to be concerned in altering the line of pull of a tendon (patella in the quadriceps tendon) or with helping to prevent friction (as in the peroneus longus tendon moving against the cuboid bone).</p><p>Union between bones can be in one of three ways: by fibrous tissue, by cartilage or by synovial joints.</p><p>Fibrous joints exist between bones or cartilages. The surfaces are simply joined by fibrous tissue (Fig. 1.7A) and movement is negligible. Fibrous joints unite the bones of the vault of the skull at the sutures; these gradually ossify (from within outwards) as the years pass by. A fibrous joint unites the lower ends of tibia and fibula; this does not ossify.</p><p>Cartilaginous joints are of two varieties, primary and secondary. A primary cartilaginous joint is one where bone and hyaline cartilage meet (Fig. 1.7B). The junction of bone and cartilage in ossifying hyaline cartilage provides an example. Thus all epiphyses are primary cartilaginous joints, as are the junctions of ribs with their own costal cartilages. All primary cartilaginous joints are quite immobile and are very strong. The adjacent bone may fracture, but the bone-cartilage interface will not separate.</p><p>A secondary cartilaginous joint (symphysis) is a union between bones whose articular surfaces are covered with a thin lamina of hyaline cartilage (Fig. 1.7C). The hyaline laminae are united by fibrocartilage. There is frequently a cavity in the fibrocartilage, but it is never lined with synovial membrane and it contains only tissue fluid. Examples are the pubic symphysis and the joint of the sternal angle (between the manubrium and the body of the sternum). An intervertebral disc is part of a secondary cartilaginous joint, but here the cavity in the fibrocartilage contains a gel (p. 537).</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.7</strong> Fibrous and cartilaginous joints in section. A Fibrous joint. B Primary cartilaginous joint. C Secondary cartilaginous joint.</p><p>A limited amount of movement is possible in secondary cartilaginous joints, depending on the amount of fibrous tissue within them. In spite of the name cartilaginous they have nothing in common with the primary cartilaginous joint.</p><p>Fully developed synovial joints, which include all limb joints, are characterized by six features: the bone ends taking part are covered by hyaline cartilage and surrounded by a capsule enclosing a joint cavity, the capsule is reinforced externally or internally or both by ligaments and lined internally by synovial membrane, and the joint is capable of varying degrees of movement.</p><p>The joint capsule is properly called the capsular ligament; do not forget to include it if being questioned about the ligaments of a joint. In the fetus the epiphyseal line gives attachment to the capsule, but this attachment may later wander on to either the epiphysis or the shaft, causing the adult epiphyseal line to be intracapsular or extracapsular (Fig. 1.8). The synovial membrane lines the capsule and invests all non-articulating surfaces within the joint, i.e. it is attached round the articular margin of each bone. Certain cells of the membrane secrete a hyaluronic acid derivative which is responsible for the viscosity of the fluid, whose main function is lubrication. It has the extraordinary capacity of being able to vary its viscosity, becoming thinner with rapid movement and thicker with slow. However, synovial joints should not be compared with machine bearings which require hydrodynamic lubrication. Under slow-moving weight bearing, hyaline cartilage on joint surfaces possesses an inherent slipperiness greater than that of a skate on ice. Do not imagine that there are large amounts of synovial fluid in joints; in normal joints the fluid is a mere film. The largest joint of all, the knee, only contains about 0.5 ml, but of course injury or disease may cause large effusions.</p><p>The extent to which the cartilage-covered bone-ends make contact with one another varies with different positions of the joint. When the surfaces make the maximum possible amount of contact the joint is said to be close-packed (as in the knee joint in full extension); the capsule and its reinforcing ligaments are at their tightest. When the surfaces are less congruent (as in the partly flexed knee), the joint is loose-packed and the capsule looser, at least in part. The varying degrees of contact enable the sites of maximal stress to vary, so spreading the load.</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.8</strong> Migration of joint capsules from the epiphyseal line. The epiphysis of the head of the femur becomes intracapsular, while that of the lower end becomes extracapsular.</p><p>Intra-articular fibrocartilages. Discs or menisci of fibrocartilage are found in certain joints, usually but not always in contact with bones that have developed in membrane. They may be complete or incomplete. They occur characteristically in joints in which two separate movements take place, each movement occurring in its own compartment (elevation and depression at the sternoclavicular joint, rotation at the knee).</p><p>Fatty pads are found in some synovial joints, occupying spaces where bony surfaces are incongruous. Covered in synovial membrane, they probably function as swabs to spread synovial fluid. Examples occur in the hip (the Haversian fat pad, p. 167) and the talocalcaneonavicular joint (p. 205) and in the infrapatellar fold and alar folds of the knee joint (p. 182).</p><h2 id=blood-supply>Blood supply
<a class=anchor href=#blood-supply>#</a></h2><p>Hyaline cartilage is bloodless, bone is a bloody structure. As a centre of ossification appears, blood vessels grow in from any convenient artery. The nutrient vessel to the shaft of a long bone branches generally from the main artery of the particular limb segment concerned and, as elongation of the bone proceeds, the artery gets carried obliquely away from the growing end of the bone. The end of the shaft in contact with the epiphyseal plate of cartilage is the metaphysis. In the metaphysis the terminal branches of the nutrient artery of the shaft are end arteries, subject to the pathological phenomena of embolism and infarction; osteomyelitis in the child most commonly involves the metaphysis for this reason (Fig. 1.9).</p><p>The cartilaginous epiphysis has, like all hyaline cartilage, no blood supply. The synovial membrane, joint mesenchyme and its derivatives are supplied from a vascular plexus that surrounds the epiphysis and sends branches to the joint structures. It lies between the capsule and the synovial membrane at their attachment to the epiphyseal line. It was described by William Hunter (John&rsquo;s brother) as the circulus vasculosus. As ossification of the cartilaginous epiphysis begins, branches from the vascular circle penetrate to the ossification centre. They have no communication across the epiphyseal plate with the vessels of the shaft. Not until the epiphyseal plate ossifies, at cessation of growth, are vascular communications established. Now the metaphysis contains no end arteries and is no longer subject to infarction from embolism; osteomyelitis, once common in the child in this region before the days of antibiotics, no longer has any particular site of election in the bone.</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.9</strong> Blood supply of a synovial joint. Part of the capsule is removed and the upper bone is shown in longitudinal section.</p><p>The capsule and other ligaments are supplied by numerous afferent nerve endings, including thinly myelinated pain fibres. Synovial membrane contains relatively few pain fibres, but there are no afferent fibres in articular cartilage; joint pain is poorly localized. Hilton&rsquo;s Law: The motor nerve to a muscle tends to give a branch of supply to the joint which the muscle moves and another branch to the skin over the joint.</p><p>Factors contributing to the stability of joints may be conveniently analysed under the headings bony, ligamentous and muscular. Atmospheric pressure is a negligible factor in most joints. The importance of the three factors is nearly always in the ascending order of bone, ligament and muscle.</p><p>Bony contours. In such a firm ball and socket joint as the hip, or a mortise joint like the ankle, bony contours play an important part; but in most joints (e.g. sacroiliac, shoulder, knee, mandibular, arches of foot) they contribute nothing at all to stability.</p><p>Ligaments. Ligaments are an important factor in most joints, acting for the most part in preventing over-movement and in guarding against sudden accidental stresses. However, they are usually of no avail in guarding against continuous stress (e.g. in supporting the arches of the foot), since they are composed of white fibrous tissue (collagen) which, once stretched, tends to remain elongated. This is well seen in double-jointed contortionists, in whom the usually restricting ligaments are kept permanently elongated by practice. Elastic tissue in ligaments gives a different picture, since such ligaments shorten after elongation. The ligamenta flava and the ligaments of the joints of the auditory ossicles are composed of yellow elastic tissue, an important factor in maintaining stability of the joints concerned. Yellow elastic fibres compose the nuchal ligament of long-necked animals, but not of man, whose skull is balanced on the vertical cervical spine and whose nuchal ligament consists merely of a thin sheet of fibrous tissue, a median intermuscular septum.</p><p>Muscles. In almost all joints muscles are the most important, and in many an indispensable factor in maintaining stability. Such joints as the knee and shoulder are very unstable without their muscles; wasting of vastus medialis after synovial effusion, for example, is followed by a feeling of insecurity in the knee in a matter of hours. The short muscles of the scapula are indispensable as fixators of the shoulder joint in all movements of the upper limb. Muscles are essential to the maintenance of the arches of the foot. There are many other examples. The matter of stability is discussed under individual joints.</p><h2 id=mucous-membranes>MUCOUS MEMBRANES
<a class=anchor href=#mucous-membranes>#</a></h2><p>A mucous membrane is the lining of an internal body surface that communicates with the exterior. This definition must not be taken to imply that all mucous membranes secrete mucus; many parts of the alimentary and respiratory tracts do but most of the urinary tract does not. Mucous membranes consist of two and sometimes three elements: always an epithelium and an underlying connective tissue layer, the lamina propria, which in much of the alimentary tract contains a thin third component of smooth muscle, the muscularis mucosae. The whole mucous membrane, often called mucosa, usually lies on a further connective tissue layer, the submucous layer or submucosa. The epithelium of a mucous membrane varies according to the site and functional needs, e.g. stratified squamous in the mouth, columnar in the intestine, ciliated in the trachea.</p><h2 id=serous-membranes>SEROUS MEMBRANES
<a class=anchor href=#serous-membranes>#</a></h2><p>A serous membrane (serosa) is the lining of a closed body cavity—pericardial, pleural and peritoneal—and consists of connective tissue covered on the surface by a single layer of flattened mesothelial cells (derived from the mesoderm of the coelomic cavity). The part of the serosa that lines the wall of the cavity (the parietal layer of pericardium, pleura or peritoneum) is directly continuous with the same membrane that covers or envelops the mobile viscera within the cavity (the visceral layer). The peritoneal, pericardial and pleural cavities are thus potential slit-like spaces between the visceral layer that clothes the viscus and the parietal layer that lines the walls of the cavity. The two layers slide readily on each other, lubricated by a film of tissue fluid (lymph). There are no glands to produce a lubricating secretion. The serous membranes are usually very adherent to the viscera, from which they can be stripped only with some difficulty. The parietal layer is attached to the wall of the containing cavity by loose areolar tissue and in most places can be stripped away easily. The word serosa is a diminutive of serous membrane. Although the female peritoneal cavity theoretically communicates with the exterior via the uterine tubes, uterus and vagina, it must still be classified with its male counterpart as having a serous lining.</p><p>The parietal layer of all serous membranes is derived from the somatopleure, and is supplied segmentally by spinal nerves. The visceral layer, developed from the splanchnopleure, possesses no sensory supply (p. 36).</p><h2 id=blood-vessels-and-lymphatics>BLOOD VESSELS AND LYMPHATICS
<a class=anchor href=#blood-vessels-and-lymphatics>#</a></h2><p>Perhaps more than any other arrangement in the body vascular patterns vary within extremely wide limits. This is not surprising when one thinks for a moment of the way in which the adult pattern is reached. The embryo is little more than a bloody sponge, possessing a vast and intricate network of anastomosing veins. Arteries are sprouting, new vessels replacing the old, while the venous pattern is reached by the disappearance of most of the network of veins in the embryo. The wonder is that such uniformity of pattern is ever attained. The site of origin of a branch from the parent trunk is very variable; the field of supply is much less variable (this applies to peripheral nerves, too).</p><p>An interesting feature of embryology is found in the fate of the vessels supplying an organ that migrates far from the site of its original appearance. In one case the vessels may persist, merely elongating to reach the organ, as in the gonads; in another case a series of new vessels appear, replacing the old as the organ migrates, as in the kidney. The kidney is developed at the pelvic brim, where it is supplied by the prolongation of the dorsal aorta known as the median sacral artery. As the kidney climbs up the posterior abdominal wall it is supplied successively from the internal iliac and common iliac arteries and then by a series of branches from the abdominal aorta until the definitive adult position is reached. One or more aortic branches may persist as abnormal renal arteries.</p><p>It is true of all parts of the body that veins are bigger than their corresponding arteries, for the simple hydrodynamic reason that the rate of flow is so much slower in them. For the same reason they are often double, as the venae comitantes of peripheral limb arteries. Note that in both the hand and the foot most of the venous return is by way of the dorsum, to escape the pressure of the palm and sole which would constrict the veins. In the proximal parts of limbs the venae comitantes unite into a single large vein (axillary, popliteal).</p><p>Large veins have dead space around them, to allow for the great dilatation that takes place during increased blood flow. The axillary vein lies in front of the prevertebral and axillary fasciae where it has adequate room to expand, the femoral vein lies alongside the femoral canal, into which it can readily expand. The internal jugular vein has a loose part of the carotid sheath around it, unlike the dense part over the carotid artery. The pulmonary veins lie in the lower part of the lung root, where they can expand between the two lax layers of the pulmonary ligament. The dead space alongside large veins commonly contains the regional lymph nodes (e.g. deep inguinal nodes alongside the femoral vein, lateral axillary nodes medial to the axillary vein, deep cervical nodes along the internal jugular vein).</p><h2 id=structure>Structure
<a class=anchor href=#structure>#</a></h2><p>The very smallest vessels, the capillaries, consist only of very flattened endothelial cells, but others are made up of three layers of tissue. The tunica intima has an endothelial lining with a variable amount of underlying connective tissue which, in arteries, includes the internal elastic lamina, giving the characteristic crenated appearance to the lumen of an artery in transverse histological section. The tunica media contains circular smooth muscle fibres, and there is an external elastic lamina at the junction of this and the outer connective tissue layer, the tunica adventitia. The largest vessels like the aorta and its branches have a large amount of elastic tissue mixed with the muscle fibres of the tunica media. Veins have a much thinner media than their corresponding arteries, and have no internal elastic lamina. Some vessels have special characteristics. The inferior vena cava has no media. In the umbilical arteries the media is arranged in two layers, inner longitudinal and outer circular, with no elastic laminae. Because of the thickness of their walls the larger vessels have their own penetrating vessels, the vasa vasorum.</p><h2 id=venous-valves>Venous valves
<a class=anchor href=#venous-valves>#</a></h2><p>Many veins of moderate calibre, both superficial and deep, possess valves whose closure prevents a reversal of bloodflow, especially in the lower limb (the great saphenous vein has about 15). They usually consist of two apposed cusps, rather like miniature cusps of the aortic and pulmonary valves. Their presence in the superficial veins of the arm was a major factor in Harvey&rsquo;s discovery of the circulation of the blood. Among those veins that have no true valves are the superior and inferior venae cavae, veins of the head and neck (including the ophthalmic veins and the dural sinuses), vertebral, cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic and pelvic veins, and the portal vein and its tributaries.</p><h2 id=anastomosis-of-arteries>Anastomosis of arteries
<a class=anchor href=#anastomosis-of-arteries>#</a></h2><p>The anastomoses between various arteries of the body are of great importance in medicine and surgery alike. They are of two types.</p><p>(1) Actual, where arteries meet end to end. The test for such an anastomosis is that the cut vessel spurts from both ends. Examples are found in the labial branches of the facial arteries, the intercostal arteries, the uterine and ovarian arteries, and the arteries of the greater and lesser curvatures of the stomach, the arterial arcades of the mesentery, the marginal artery of the colon, etc.</p><p>(2) Potential. Here the anastomosis is by terminal arterioles. Given sufficient time the arterioles can dilate to take sufficient blood, but with sudden occlusion of a main vessel the immediate anastomosis may be inadequate to nourish the part. Examples are seen in the coronary arteries, most of the limb anastomoses in the region of joints, and the cortical arteries of the cerebral hemispheres.</p><p>INTRODUCTION TO REGIONAL ANATOMY</p><p>Short-circuiting channels (shunts or arteriovenous anastomoses) between terminal arterioles and primary venules have been demonstrated in many parts of the body; in fingertips they are complex structures called glomus bodies. They can short-circuit arteriolar blood directly into venules, bypassing the capillary bed, and so causing variations in regional blood flow. In skin they may have a role in temperature regulation, but in general the reasons for their existence and the mechanisms of their control are not understood.</p><h2 id=lymphatic-vessels>Lymphatic vessels
<a class=anchor href=#lymphatic-vessels>#</a></h2><p>In considering the blood supply to any organ or part it makes for a more complete picture if arterial input is always linked with venous and lymphatic return. Not all the blood entering a part returns by way of veins; much of it becomes tissue fluid and returns by way of lymphatics.</p><p>There is a simple principle that clarifies the whole picture of the lymphatics of the body. It is that superficial lymphatics (i.e. in subcutaneous tissues) follow veins while deep lymphatics follow arteries. This is true of almost any part of the body except the tongue, which is quite exceptional. The fact that lymphatics accompany arteries seems to be beneficial, for it is probable that the pulsations of arteries compress the nearby lymphatics and so milk the lymph along. If this is so it would certainly account for the multitude of valves with which lymphatics are provided.</p><p>It must be realized that tissue fluid first enters an intricate plexus of minute lymphatic vessels (capillaries) from which there are usually alternative routes to regional lymph nodes. A given drop of lymph may go by one of several paths, depending on local and even distant pressures, and it is only when it reaches a definitive lymphatic vessel with its valves that its subsequent route becomes unalterable. Thus accounts and illustrations of lymphatic drainage vary in different textbooks and atlases. The question, &ldquo;Which description is correct?&rdquo; has no answer, since all may be correct under different circumstances.</p><p>Clinical spread of disease (e.g. infection, neoplasm) by lymphatics does not necessarily follow strictly anatomical pathways. Lymph nodes may be bypassed by the disease process. If lymphatics become dilated by obstruction their valves may be separated and reversal of lymph flow can then occur. Lymphatics communicate with veins freely in many parts of the body; the termination of the thoracic duct may be ligated with impunity, for the lymph finds its way satisfactorily into more peripheral venous channels.</p><h2 id=lymphoid-tissue>LYMPHOID TISSUE
<a class=anchor href=#lymphoid-tissue>#</a></h2><p>The defence mechanisms of the body include phagocytosis, which is a non-specific engulfing process, and the immune response which is a specific reaction to micro-organisms and foreign proteins (antigens). The immune response may occur in two ways: (1) by the humoral antibody response, with production of antibodies which are protein molecules that circulate in the blood and attach themselves to the foreign protein so that the combination of antigen and antibody can be destroyed by phagocytosis; and (2) by the cell-mediated immune response, with the production of specific cells that circulate in the blood and destroy the antigen or stimulate its phagocytosis. Two types of lymphocyte produce these reactions: T cells are responsible for cell-mediated immunity and B cells for humoral antibody production. The B cells become transformed into plasma cells which produce the antibody molecules (the various immunoglobulins—IgG, IgM, etc.). This ability to produce large quantities of one particular antibody has led to the development of the monoclonal antibody technique for identifying specific antigens.</p><p>All lymphocytes arise from common stem cells in bone marrow (in the embryo, from yolk sac and liver). Some of them circulate to and settle in the thymus where they proliferate. After release into the bloodstream as T cells they colonize the spleen, lymph nodes and other lymphoid follicles by passing through the postcapillary venules of those structures. Other stem cells become B cells and similarly colonize lymphoid follicles. The T cells are so named because they depend on the Thymus for their development; cell-mediated immunity thus depends on this organ. The B cells were not named because they developed from bone marrow, although in man this does happen to be a convenient aid to memory; the name is from the Bursa of Fabricius in birds, for it was in chickens that this organ (near the cloaca) was first found to be the source of humoral antibodies. Although at one time the Peyer&rsquo;s patches of the gut were thought to be the human equivalent of this bursa, bone marrow is currently considered to be the likeliest source. The main types of T cell are at present known as T helper, T suppressor, T killer (cytotoxic) and T memory, while B cells can either form plasma cells or become B memory cells. The discovery of these various subgroups of lymphocytes and the interactions between themselves and macrophages has made immunology one of the most rapidly developing fields of medical research.</p><p>The lymphoid organs of human anatomy consist of the thymus, lymph nodes, tonsils and spleen. All have an internal connective tissue framework to support the cellular elements. In all except the thymus the characteristic structural feature is the lymphoid nodule or follicle, which is typically a spherical collection of lymphocytes with a pale central area, the germinal centre (paler than the periphery of the follicle in stained sections because the lymphocytes are more loosely packed centrally). Isolated lymphoid follicles occur in the mucosa and submucosa of all parts of the alimentary and respiratory tracts; collections of follicles in the ileum form the aggregated lymphoid follicles or Peyer&rsquo;s patches. The gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is collectively the largest mass of lymphoid tissue in the body. The special enterocytes (M cells) overlying mucosal lymphoid follicles absorb antigenic material which is then exposed to intraepithelial and follicular lymphocytes and macrophages so that an appropriate immune response can occur.</p><p>In the thymus the lymphocytes are not concentrated in rounded follicles but form a continuous dense band of tissue at the outer region or cortex of the lobules into which the organ is divided. The inner (paler) regions of the lobules form the medulla which contains the characteristic thymic corpuscles (of Hassall); these are remnants of the epithelium of the third pharyngeal pouches from which the thymus developed. The continuous cortex and the thymic corpuscles immediately identify a typical thymus histologically (although in the ageing adult there is usually much replacement by fibrofatty tissue).</p><p>In a typical lymph node the rounded follicles of lymphocytes are concentrated at the periphery (cortex), but these are not the only lymphocytes in the node. There are others (not collected into follicles) in regions adjacent to the cortex—the paracortical areas—and also in the medullary region at the hilum of the node where the efferent lymphatic vessels leave. B lymphocytes are found in the follicles (in whose germinal centres they proliferate) and medulla, and T lymphocytes in the paracortical areas (the thymus-dependent zone) and in the cortex between follicles. The nodes receive afferent lymph vessels as well as draining by efferent channels; they act as filters as well as being a source of lymphocytes. (Thymus and spleen have no afferent lymphatics).</p><p>tissue the tonsils have on their inner surfaces a covering of stratified squamous epithelium that dips down deeply to form the tonsillar crypts. The presence of this epithelium distinguishes tonsils from lymph nodes histologically.</p><p>The lymphoid follicles of the spleen which collectively form its white pulp are scattered among the sinusoids or red pulp. The splenic follicles have a unique identifying feature: an arteriole courses through them, near but not through their germinal centres. Of course, in random histological sections not every follicle will be cut in a plane that displays the arteriole, but when seen it is pathognomonic of spleen, which also has a thick connective tissue capsule with trabeculae extending inwards from it. T cells are found in the immediate periarteriolar region of the follicle, with B cells in the germinal centre and other parts.</p><p>Apart from lymphocytes, all lymphoid organs contain phagocytic cells (macrophages, histiocytes) as part of the reticuloendothelial (monocyte-macrophage) system.</p><p>For convenience of description the nervous system is divided into the central nervous system, which consists of the brain and spinal cord (spinal medulla), and the peripheral nervous system composed of cranial and spinal nerves and their associated ganglia. The central and peripheral parts each have somatic and autonomic components; the somatic are concerned with the innervation of skeletal muscle (along efferent pathways) and the transmission of sensory information (along afferent pathways), and the autonomic are concerned with the control of cardiac muscle, smooth muscle and glands (involving afferent and efferent pathways). The term autonomic nervous system, which can be applied collectively to all autonomic components, i.e. those that control the internal environment of the body, is again a descriptive term of convenience and must not be taken as implying something anatomically separate. Indeed, functionally there is only one nervous system, with a basically simple plan of afferent (sensory) and efferent (motor) pathways, together with interconnexions (which in the central nervous system can be highly complex).</p><p>The central nervous system is described on page 577 and the peripheral and autonomic parts are considered with the appropriate regions of the body. Here some basic principles of neural organization are dealt with.</p><p>The structural and functional unit of the nervous system is the nerve cell or neuron. It consists of a part containing the nucleus, the cell body, and a variable number of processes commonly called nerve fibres. A single cytoplasmic process, the axon (often very long), conducts nerve impulses away from the cell body, and may give off many collaterals and terminal branches to many different target cells. Other multiple cytoplasmic processes, the dendrites (usually very short), expand the surface area of the cell body for the reception of stimuli. In everyday medical parlance the word neuron is often used to mean the cell body of the nerve cell, but it should be remembered that such use is not strictly correct since the word properly means not only the cell body but all its processes as well.</p><p>Pathways are established in the nervous system by communications between neurons at synapses, which are sites on the cell body or its processes where chemical transmitters enable nerve impulses to be handed on from one neuron to another. Often, in sympathetic ganglia for example, there are many more synapses on dendrites than on the cell bodies. The small number of classical transmitters such as acetylcholine and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) has been vastly supplemented in recent years by many others which may not only be neurotransmitters but have endocrine functions as well, and may be found in many parts of the body apart from the nervous system. They are variously grouped as neuroendocrine cells, neuromediators or APUD cells (amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation), and may collectively form a diffuse neuroendocrine system. Specialist texts and journals must be consulted for the current status of their components and functions.</p><p>Cell bodies with similar function show a great tendency to group themselves together, forming nuclei within the central nervous system and ganglia outside it. Similarly processes from such aggregations of cell bodies tend to run together in bundles, forming tracts within the central nervous system and nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. The fibres of peripheral nerves are often loosely called axis cylinders or axons despite the fact that functionally many of them may be dendrites.</p><p>Apart from neurons the nervous system contains other cells collectively known as neuroglial cells (neuroglia, or simple glia or glial cells), which have supporting and other functions, but which do not have the property of excitability or conductivity possessed by neurons. The main types of neuroglial cell are astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, which like neurons are developed from ectoderm of the neural tube. A third type of neuroglial cell is the microglial cell (microglia) which is the phagocytic cell of the nervous system, corresponding to the macrophage of connective tissue and which is derived from mesoderm. The satellite cells of ganglia outside the central nervous system and the Schwann cells of peripheral nerves are derived from ectoderm of the neural tube and constitute the glial cells of the peripheral nervous system.</p><p>Nerve fibres may be myelinated or unmyelinated. In the central nervous system myelin is formed by oligodendrocytes, and in peripheral nerves by Schwann cells (still the commonly used name for what are now properly called neurolemmocytes). In myelinated fibres, the regions where longitudinally adjacent Schwann cells or oligodendrocyte processes adjoin one another are the nerve fibre nodes (of Ranvier). The white matter of the nervous system is essentially a mass of nerve fibres and is so called because of the general pale appearance imparted by the fatty myelin, in contrast to grey matter which is darker and consists essentially of cell bodies. Further details of the cellular composition of nervous tissue will be found in textbooks of histology, but it is relevant to regional anatomy to note the varying sizes of peripheral nerve fibres and the functions that can be associated with them (with an alternative classification for afferent fibres):</p><p>Group A: up to 20 µm diameter, subdivided into -
α: 12–20 µm. Motor and proprioception (Ia and Ib)
β: 5–12 µm. Touch, pressure and proprioception (II)
γ: 5–12 µm. Fusimotor to muscle spindles (II)
δ: 1–15 µm. Touch, pain and temperature (III).
Group B: up to 3 µm diameter. Myelinated. Preganglionic autonomic.
Group C: up to 2 µm diameter. Unmyelinated. Postganglionic autonomic, and touch and pain (IV).</p><p>Unfortunately, as can be seen from the above, it is not possible to make a precise prediction of function from mere size. Thus the largest myelinated fibres may be motor or proprioceptive and the smallest, whether myelinated or unmyelinated, are autonomic or sensory.</p><p>There are 31 pairs of spinal nerves—8 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral and 1 coccygeal. Each spinal nerve is formed by the union of an anterior (ventral) and posterior (dorsal) root which emerge from the side of the spinal cord. The union does not take place adjacent to the cord but within the intervertebral foramen of the appropriate nerve, immediately distal to the swelling on the posterior root which indicates the site of the posterior root ganglion and which is also within the foramen. The anterior root of every spinal nerve contains motor (efferent) fibres for skeletal muscle; those from T1 to L2 inclusive and from S2 to S4 also contain autonomic fibres. Although hitherto regarded as containing only efferent fibres, it is now known that the anterior root also contains a small number of unmyelinated afferent pain fibres which have doubled back from their cells of origin in the posterior root ganglion to enter the spinal cord by the anterior root instead of by the expected posterior root. The posterior root of every nerve contains sensory (afferent) fibres whose cell bodies are in the posterior root ganglion. There are no synapses in these ganglia; it is simply the site of the cell bodies.</p><p>Immediately after its formation the spinal nerve divides into an anterior and a posterior ramus (formerly known as primary rami, but since there is nothing called a secondary ramus the unnecessary adjective has been dropped). The great nerve plexuses—cervical, brachial, lumbar and sacral—are formed from anterior rami; posterior rami do not form plexuses. Very often the posterior ramus appears to be a direct branch from the posterior root ganglion, so that macroscopically there appears to be no spinal nerve proper; at best it is only a millimetre or two long.</p><p>Connective tissue binds the individual fibres of spinal nerves together to form the single nerve. In all but the very smallest nerves the fibres are collected together into several rounded bundles or fascicles, each surrounded by perineurium, a condensation of connective tissue easily seen in transverse histological sections. The epineurium is the rather looser tissue which binds the fascicles into a single nerve, while endoneurium is the name given to the very finest fibrils (visible only with the electron microscope) which surround every single nerve fibre. In the largest nerve, the sciatic, only about 20% of the cross-sectional area is nerve, so 80% is connective tissue, but in smaller nerves the amount of neural tissue is proportionally greater. In the same way that the larger blood vessels have their own vessels in their walls (vasa vasorum), so the larger nerves have their own nerves, the nervi nervorum, in their connective tissue coverings. The presence of these neglected structures in, for example, the sciatic nerve explains the distribution of pain in some inflammatory affections of the nerve.</p><h2 id=blood-supply-of-nerves>Blood supply of nerves
<a class=anchor href=#blood-supply-of-nerves>#</a></h2><p>Peripheral nerve trunks in the limbs are supplied by branches from local arteries. The sciatic nerve in the buttock and the median nerve at the elbow have each a large branch from the inferior gluteal and common interosseous arteries respectively, each the former axial artery of the limb. Elsewhere, however, regional arteries supply nerves by a series of longitudinal branches which anastomose freely within the epineurium, so that nerves can be displaced widely from their beds without risk to their blood supply. The phrenic nerve, finding no regional artery in its course through the mediastinum, takes its own artery with it (the pericardiacophrenic artery, p. 261).</p><h2 id=general-principles-of-nerve-supply>GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF NERVE SUPPLY
<a class=anchor href=#general-principles-of-nerve-supply>#</a></h2><p>Once the nerve supply to a part is established in the embryo it never alters thereafter, unlike the vascular supply. However far a structure may migrate in the developing fetus it always drags its nerve with it. Conversely, the nerve supply to an adult structure affords visible evidence of its embryonic origin.</p><p>Skeletal muscles are innervated from motor neuron pools—groups of motor nerve cell bodies in certain cranial nerve nuclei of the brainstem and anterior horns of the spinal cord. The pool supplying any one muscle overlaps the pools of another, e.g. the anterior horn cells of spinal cord segments C5 and 6 that supply deltoid are intermixed with cells of the same segments supplying subscapularis and other muscles. The only exceptions to the overlapping of neuronal pools are the brainstem nuclei of the fourth and sixth cranial nerves, since they are the only motor nerve cell groups supplying only one muscle (superior oblique and lateral rectus of the eye respectively).</p><p>The branches of spinal nerves that are called somatic motor nerves (e.g. to limb muscles) are not purely motor, since they also contain afferent fibres from those muscles and from joints and ligaments, i.e. fibres of postural sensibility or proprioception. It follows that mixed nerves with motor and cutaneous fibres must also contain proprioceptive fibres, but purely cutaneous nerves which carry touch, pain and temperature fibres do not have those of proprioceptive sensibility. Lesions of motor and mixed nerves will therefore cause proprioceptive as well as motor loss, but lesions of cutaneous nerves will not cause proprioceptive loss.</p><p>The body wall is supplied segmentally by spinal nerves (Fig. 1.10). The posterior rami pass backwards and supply the extensor muscles of the vertebral column and skull, and to a varying extent the skin that overlies them. The anterior rami supply all other muscles of the trunk and limbs and the skin at the sides and front of the neck and body.</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.10</strong> Neurovascular plane of the body wall, between the inner and middle of the three muscle layers. Where the spinal nerve and segmental artery cross, the nerve lies nearer the skin. The segmental nerve enters rectus abdominis (usually behind rather than in front of the epigastric arteries, as shown here) and passes to the overlying skin, but the segmental artery ends in the flank muscles. The sympathetic trunk lies vertically within the circle of the segmental artery.</p><p>In the trunk all the muscles of the erector spinae and transversospinalis groups that lie deep to the thoracolumbar fascia, and the levator costae muscles of the thorax (which belong morphologically to the extensor groups) are supplied segmentally by the posterior rami of spinal nerves. In the neck splenius and all muscles deep to it are similarly supplied.</p><p>The cutaneous distribution of the posterior rami extends further out than the extensor muscles—almost to the posterior axillary lines. It is to be remembered that:</p><p>(1) Each posterior ramus divides into a medial and a lateral branch (Fig. 1.10). Both branches of all the posterior rami supply muscle, but only one branch, either medial or lateral, reaches the skin.</p><p>(2) C1 has no cutaneous branch, and the posterior rami of the lower two nerves in the cervical and lumbar regions of the cord likewise fail to reach the skin. All 12 thoracic and 5 sacral nerves reach the skin.</p><p>(3) In the upper half of the body the medial branches, and in the lower half the lateral branches, of the posterior rami provide the cutaneous branches (Fig. 1.11).</p><p>(4) No posterior ramus ever supplies skin or muscle of a limb in any vertebrate.</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.11</strong> Distribution of posterior rami. On the right the cutaneous distribution is shown (medial branches down to T6, to clear the scapula, and lateral branches below this); the stippled areas of skin are supplied by anterior rami. On the left the muscular distribution is shown, to erector spinae and to splenius and the muscles deep to it.</p><h2 id=anterior-rami>Anterior rami
<a class=anchor href=#anterior-rami>#</a></h2><p>The anterior rami supply the prevertebral flexor muscles segmentally by separate branches from each nerve (e.g. longus capitis, scalene muscles, psoas, quadratus lumborum, piriformis). The anterior rami of the 12 thoracic nerves and L1 supply the muscles of the body wall segmentally. Each intercostal nerve supplies the muscles of its intercostal space, and the lower six nerves pass beyond the costal margin to supply the muscles of the anterior abdominal wall. The first lumbar nerve (iliohypogastric and ilioinguinal nerves) is the lowest spinal nerve to supply the anterior abdominal wall.</p><p>In the trunk the skin is supplied in strips or zones in regular sequence from T2 to L1 inclusive. The intercostal nerves have each a lateral branch to supply the sides and an anterior terminal branch to supply the front of the body wall (Fig. 1.12). The lower six thoracic nerves pass beyond the costal margin obliquely downwards to supply the skin of the abdominal wall. Each nerve throughout the whole of its course supplies a strip of skin that overlies it (a dermatome, p. 22). On the body wall adjacent dermatomes overlap considerably, so that interruption of a single segment produces no anaesthesia (Fig. 1.12).</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.12</strong> Overlap of dermatomes on the body wall. On the right side the supraclavicular and thoracic nerves are shown; on the left the anterior axial line is indicated.

<a class=anchor href=#sympathetic-fibres>#</a></h2><p>Every spinal nerve without exception, from C1 to the coccygeal, carries postganglionic (unmyelinated, grey) sympathetic fibres which hitch-hike along the nerves and accompany all their branches. They leave the spinal nerve only at the site of their peripheral destination. They are in the main vasoconstrictor in function, though some go to sweat glands in the skin (sudomotor) and to the arrectores pilorum muscles of the hair roots (pilomotor). In this way the sympathetic system innervates the whole body wall and all four limbs. This is chiefly for the function of temperature regulation. The visceral branches of the sympathetic system have a different manner of distribution (p. 31).</p><h2 id=nerve-supply-of-limbs>NERVE SUPPLY OF LIMBS
<a class=anchor href=#nerve-supply-of-limbs>#</a></h2><p>The body wall has been seen to be supplied segmentally by spinal nerves (Fig. 1.10). A longitudinal strip posteriorly is supplied by posterior rami, a lateral strip by the lateral branches of the anterior rami, and a ventral strip by the anterior terminal branches of the anterior rami. In all vertebrates the limb buds grow out from the lateral strip supplied by the lateral branches of the anterior rami (Fig. 1.13) and these lateral branches, by their anterior and posterior divisions, form the plexuses for supply of the muscles and skin of the limbs (Fig. 1.14). The posterior divisions supply extensor muscles and skin of the limbs. The anterior divisions generally represent fusion of the anterior division of the lateral branch with the anterior terminal branch. They supply flexor muscles and skin of the limbs.</p><p>Each limb consists of a flexor and an extensor compartment, which meet at the preaxial and postaxial borders of the limb. These borders are marked out conveniently by veins. In the upper limb the cephalic vein lies at the preaxial and the basilic vein at the postaxial border. In the lower limb extension and medial rotation, which replace the early fetal position of flexion, have complicated the picture. The great saphenous vein marks out the preaxial and the small saphenous vein the postaxial borders of the limb.</p><p>In all vertebrates the skin and muscles of the limbs are supplied by plexuses. The plexuses are formed from the anterior rami, never from the posterior rami, of spinal nerves. The spinal nerves entering into a limb plexus</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.13</strong> Origin of the limb buds. The body wall is innervated in three longitudinal strips, and the embryonic limb bud grows out from the lateral (middle) strip, supplied by lateral branches of the anterior rami.</p><p>22 LAST&rsquo;S ANATOMY</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.14</strong> Typical body wall nerve and its incorporation into a limb plexus. The numbers in the two diagrams indicate corresponding structures. 1—Posterior ramus, 2—anterior ramus, 3—posterior branch of lateral branch of spinal nerve in body wall and posterior division of limb plexus in limb bud, 4—anterior branch of lateral branch of spinal nerve in body wall and anterior division of limb plexus in limb bud, 5—anterior terminal branch of spinal nerve in body wall, incorporated into the anterior division of the limb plexus.</p><p>Because of the way nerve fibres become combined and rearranged in plexuses, any one spinal nerve can contribute to more than one peripheral nerve and peripheral nerves can receive fibres from more than one spinal nerve. It follows that the area of skin supplied by any one spinal nerve or spinal cord segment (dermatome—see below) is not the same as the area supplied by the particular spinal nerve. It is therefore necessary to learn two kinds of skin maps or charts—one showing segmental innervation and the other showing peripheral nerves. The segmental supplies are reviewed below; the peripheral nerves of the upper and lower limbs are summarized on pages 120 and 212.</p><p>The flexor compartment has a richer nerve supply than the extensor compartment; this applies to both skin and muscle supplies. The richer innervation, both sensory and motor, of the flexor compartment shows in the fact that the most caudal root of a limb plexus is distributed entirely to the flexor compartment of the limb. This is T1 in the brachial plexus (apart from a small area of skin innervated by the posterior cutaneous nerve of the arm none of this segment supplies the extensor compartment) and S3 in the sacral plexus—no S3 enters the extensor compartment of the lower limb (peroneal nerve). Note the composition of the two parts of the sciatic nerve:</p><h2 id=double-innervation-of-muscles>Double innervation of muscles
<a class=anchor href=#double-innervation-of-muscles>#</a></h2><p>In a few cases muscles near the preaxial or postaxial border of a limb receive a double nerve supply. Generally they are flexor muscles that receive a supply from the nerve of the extensor compartment. This apparent contradiction is due to embryological causes, namely that the muscle concerned was developed in the extensor compartment of the fetal limb but lies, for functional reasons, in the flexor compartment of the adult limb, bringing its nerve with it. The lateral portion of brachialis (supplied by the radial nerve) and the short head of biceps femoris (supplied by the peroneal part of the sciatic nerve) are examples of flexor muscles supplied by extensor compartment nerves, and in each case the remainder of the muscle is, in fact, supplied by a flexor compartment nerve.</p><p>In the arm the intermuscular septum between the flexor and extensor compartments does not represent the fetal septum. In the fetus the ulnar nerve was in the flexor compartment, while brachioradialis, the lateral part of brachialis, and the radial nerve were in the extensor compartment (Fig. 1.15). The adult septum imprisons the ulnar nerve in the extensor compartment above the elbow and brachioradialis, the lateral part of brachialis and the radial nerve in the flexor compartment.</p><h2 id=segmental-innervation-of-the-skin>SEGMENTAL INNERVATION OF THE SKIN
<a class=anchor href=#segmental-innervation-of-the-skin>#</a></h2><p>The area of skin supplied by a single spinal nerve is called a dermatome. On the trunk adjacent dermatomes overlap considerably, and so it is on the limbs except at the axial lines. The skin that envelops a limb is drawn out over the developing limb from the trunk, and study of the trunk dermatomes near the root of a limb shows that here many of the dermatomes are missing; they lie out along the limb. The line of junction of two dermatomes supplied from discontinuous spinal levels is known as an axial line, and such axial lines extend from the trunk on to the limbs.</p><p>INTRODUCTION TO REGIONAL ANATOMY</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.15</strong> Cross-section of the arm above the elbow. The arrows indicate the site of the fetal intermuscular septum between the flexor and extensor compartments. In the fetus the radial nerve and its adjoining muscles lie in the extensor compartment, and the ulnar nerve in the flexor compartment.</p><p>In the upper limb (Fig. 1.16) the anterior axial line runs from the sternal angle across the second costal cartilage and down the front of the limb almost to the wrist. Similarly a posterior axial line is said to run from the vertebra prominens across the back and down the back of the arm only as far as the insertion of the deltoid muscle.</p><p>The central dermatome of the limb plexus (C7) clothes the peripheral extremity of the limb. More cranially disposed segments are distributed to dermatomes along the preaxial border of the limb and more caudally disposed dermatomes lie along the postaxial border. There is much overlap between adjacent dermatomes but no overlap across axial lines, a point of great clinical value to remember when investigating cutaneous paraesthesia of segmental origin. Always test across axial lines. Note that the dermatomes lie in orderly numerical sequence when traced distally down the front and proximally up the back of the anterior axial line (C5, 6, 7, 8, and T1) and that these dermatomes belong to the nerves of the brachial plexus. In addition, skin has been borrowed</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.16</strong> Approximate dermatomes and axial lines of the right upper limb. See text for explanation.</p><p>from the neck and trunk to clothe the proximal part of the limb (C4 over the deltoid muscle, T2 for the axilla). The borrowing of skin resembles the borrowing of a book by a friend (borrowed, never to be returned).</p><p>Considerable distortion occurs to the dermatome pattern of the lower limb (Fig. 1.17) for two reasons. Firstly the limb, from the fetal position of flexion, is medially rotated and extended, so that the anterior axial line is caused to spiral from the root of the penis (clitoris) across the front of the scrotum (labium majus) around to the back of the thigh and calf in the midline almost to the heel. Secondly, a good deal of skin is borrowed from the trunk, and it is all borrowed on the cranial side (there is no skin caudal to the limb except a small area of perianal skin). In the upper limb there has been symmetrical cranial and caudal borrowing of skin (a little of C4 and a little of T2) but in the lower limb four dermatomes, all on the cranial side, have been borrowed from beyond the limits of the limb plexus (from T12, L1, 2 and 3). The anterior axial line has been described. The posterior axial line is said to run from the fourth lumbar interspace (the site of a lumbar puncture) in a bold convexity to the back of the thigh down to the head of the fibula and thence halfway down the calf.</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.17</strong> Approximate dermatomes and axial lines of the right lower limb. See text for explanation.</p><p>As in the upper limb the central root of the limb plexus is most peripheral, extending on to the lateral side of the sole, but it is joined on the medial side of the foot by L5. One walks on L5 and S1 and sits on S3, for it lies around the anus in a wide semicircle between the axial lines (S4 supplies the immediate perianal skin). S2 is the narrow strip up the middle of the calf and hamstrings joining S1 and S3 and limited by the axial lines. L4 is over the tibia and L5 over the fibula but extends also to include the big toe. The other dermatomes are as shown in Figure 1.17, they are borrowed skin from the trunk. Note that, as in the upper limb, the dermatomes can be traced in numerical sequence down in front and up behind the anterior axial line (L1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and S1, 2, 3).</p><p>Thus each anterior ramus, passing through the ramifications of its limb plexus, is paid off into the appropriate cutaneous nerves and finally reaches its allotted area of skin (i.e. the dermatome). The sympathetic grey ramus that joins each spinal nerve accompanies it to its dermatome (where it is temperature-regulating). Thus knowledge of the segmental supply of an area of skin tells also the site of the cell body of the sympathetic nerve in that area (p. 32).</p><p>A practical application of the anterior axial line arises in spinal analgesia. A low spinal (caudal) anaesthesia anaesthetizes skin of the posterior two-thirds of the scrotum or labium majus (S3), but to anaesthetize the anterior one-third of the scrotum or labium L1 must be involved, an additional seven spinal segments higher up.</p><p>It must be remembered that a single chart cannot indicate individual variations or the differing findings of several groups of investigators, and that such charts are a compromise between the maximal and minimal segmental areas which experience has shown can occur. Original charts, such as those made by Sherrington, Head and Foerster, are being modified by the continuing accumulation of new information. Thus T1 nerve, for example, is not usually considered to supply any thoracic skin but has sometimes been considered to do so, and L5 and S1 have been reported to extend to buttock skin although this is not usually expected. It is probable that posterior axial lines do not exist, but evidence for anterior axial lines is more convincing. Difficulty in investigation arises in the main from the blurring of patterns due to overlap from adjacent dermatomes, and is enhanced by the rarity of a lesion that is complete in one single root without involving others. Despite these complications a chart of dermatomes must be learned, on the understanding that it must be interpreted with flexibility. The following summary (which for the reasons stated above is not necessarily identical with the information given in Figs 1.16 and 1.17) offers selected guidelines that are clinically useful:</p><p>C1—no skin supply

The regular sequence of myotomes in the trunk (p. 18) appears at first sight to be broken up into a bewildering complexity of myotomes in the limbs. Knowledge is required on two points: (1) what is the segmental supply of this particular limb muscle, and (2) what is the total muscular distribution of this particular spinal segment? It is an enormous task to attempt the memorizing of muscle and nerve lists and, what is more, it is unnecessary, since the underlying plan of segmental innervation is very simple. It is based on the following four facts:</p><p>(1) Most muscles are supplied equally from two adjacent segments (but some, especially in the upper limb, are predominantly unisegmental).</p><p>(2) Muscles sharing a common primary action on a joint irrespective of their anatomical situation are all supplied by the same (usually two) segments.</p><p>(3) Their opponents, sharing the opposite action, are likewise all supplied by the same (usually two) segments and these segments usually run in numerical sequence with the former.</p><p>(4) For joints distal in the limbs the spinal centre lies lower in the cord. For a joint one segment more distal in the limb the centre lies en bloc one segment lower in the cord.</p><p>Thus there are in effect spinal centres for joint movements, and these centres tend to occupy continuous segments in the cord. The upper one or two segments innervate one movement, and the lower one or two innervate the opposite movement (although sometimes the same segment may innervate both movements, but of course from different anterior horn cells). Thus the spinal centre for the elbow is in C5, 6, 7, 8 segments and C5, 6 supply the flexors and C7, 8 the extensors of the joint. If the elbow be flexed while the numbers 5, 6 are recited, and extended to the numbers 7, 8, one only needs to perform this simple movement to the numbers 5–6 and 7–8 a few times to learn that biceps, brachialis and brachioradialis (the prime flexors of the elbow) are supplied by C5, 6 and that triceps (the prime extensor of the elbow) is supplied by C7, 8.</p><p>It is cumbersome to print all this in black and white, but very easy to demonstrate it (similar, for instance to teaching the steps of a dance or the movements of an exercise).</p><p>The above are simple flexion-extension movements and, indeed, cover all knee- and ankle-moving muscles. At the hip, however, movements other than flexion extension are possible, but all innervated by the same four segments. Thus:</p><p>Adduction or medial rotation (same as flexion) L2, 3
Abduction or lateral rotation (some as extension) L4, 5</p><p>There remains one other movement of the lower limb, namely inversion and eversion of the foot, the formula being:</p><p>Note that tibialis anterior and tibialis posterior invert the foot and both are innervated by L4 segment. Tibialis anterior is also a dorsiflexor and L4, 5 (from the formula already given for dorsiflexion) is approximately correct. Tibialis posterior, however, lies deep among the plantar flexors of the ankle (S1, 2) and it is illuminating to find this solitary muscle innervated from quite a different level from its neighbours—but a level that coincides with its inverting partner, the anterior tibial.</p><p>Only one more point need be explained about the lower limb; it concerns the muscles of the buttock. The simple formula given above shows extension, abduction and lateral rotation of the hip as L4, 5 and this covers all the muscles of the buttock. It is, indeed, accurate enough for most purposes in clinical investigation, but for those readers who require more detailed information the following analysis has greater precision:</p><p>INTRODUCTION TO REGIONAL ANATOMY</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.19</strong> Segmental innervation of movements of the upper limb.</p><p>supplied by 5, 1, 2, all the other buttock muscles by 4, 5, 1.</p><p>The upper limb movements, with the segments involved (Fig. 1.19), are as follows:</p><p>In the upper limb the two-and-two segment pattern is not as regular as in the lower limb, probably because in the upper limb much more precise movements are constantly being employed, and the spinal centres have broken up into separate nuclei to control these. Thus, below the elbow the plan does not conform to the basic pattern of four spinal segments for each joint. Flexion and extension share the same two segments; these are C6, 7 for the wrist and C7, 8 for the digits. But the rule holds that the more distal joints are innervated from lower centres in the cord.</p><p>The motor spinal centres for the joints of the limbs lie in cell aggregates in the lateral parts of the anterior grey horns in the cervical and lumbar enlargements of the cord. The medial parts of the anterior grey horns in the limb enlargements are in line with the slender grey horns of the thoracic region and, like them, supply segmentally the extensor and flexor muscles of the vertebral column and have nothing to do with the muscles of the limbs.</p><p>appropriate regional anatomy. Here it is convenient to summarize segmental or root supplies, indicating a single muscle or movement for which the segment concerned is mainly responsible, thus providing a slightly different but complementary approach to the information given in Figures 1.18 and 1.19. An exhaustive list of many muscles may be necessary for the neurological specialist, but the notes below, on muscles that can be tested easily or are otherwise clinically important, give a suitable indication of the control exerted on different parts of the body by the various levels of the spinal cord, and could be used for example as a guide to the level of spinal cord injury.</p><p>C4 Diaphragm.

In lesions of the nerve roots proper, sweating in the distribution of the appropriate nerves is normal, but in more peripheral lesions sweating is reduced, because the postganglionic sympathetic fibres from the sympathetic trunk join the nerves of plexuses distal to the nerve roots proper (Fig. 1.20C).</p><p>The nerve supplies of the head and neck are described with the appropriate regional anatomy, and on page 450.</p><h2 id=spinal-reflexes>SPINAL REFLEXES
<a class=anchor href=#spinal-reflexes>#</a></h2><p>What is commonly called the knee jerk and similar tendon reflexes are typical examples of spinal myotatic or stretch reflexes (deep tendon reflexes). They illustrate the simplest kind of reflex pathway and involve only two neurons with one synapse (monosynaptic reflex arc (Fig. 1.20A)); indeed the tendon reflexes are the only examples of monosynaptic reflex arcs, for all other reflexes involve two or more synapses (multisynaptic, Fig. 1.20B and 1.20C).</p><p>Tapping the tendon momentarily stretches the spindles within the muscle and this stimulates the afferent (Ia) fibres of the primary (annulospiral) nerve endings surrounding the intrafusal fibres to pass into the spinal cord by the posterior nerve root. These afferents synapse directly with the α motor neurons of the anterior horn whose axons form the efferent side of the arc, so causing the extrafusal fibres to contract and produce the jerk at the joint.</p><p>For most practical purposes the segments mainly concerned with the reflexes most commonly tested may be taken as: biceps jerk—C6, triceps jerk—C7, knee jerk—L3, ankle jerk—S1. (As noted above for dermatomes and myotomes, different textbook accounts may vary.)</p><p>Diminution or absence of the jerk usually indicates some kind of interruption of the arc or muscular defect, but exaggeration of the tendon reflexes is taken as evidence of an upper motor neuron lesion due to alterations in the supraspinal control of the anterior horn cells which are rendered unduly excitable. In this case the γ motor neurons of the anterior horn are stimulated by such fibres as the reticulospinal and vestibulospinal. The pathway (Fig. 1.20D) is from the γ motor neuron to the intrafusal muscle fibres of the spindle, then from the afferent fibres of the spindle to the α motor neuron and so to the extrafusal fibres. This is the γ reflex loop or fusimotor neuron loop.</p><p>In addition to the above deep tendon reflexes, there are superficial skin reflexes which are multisynaptic. Those most commonly tested are the plantar, abdominal, anal and bulbocavernosus reflexes.</p><p>Firm stroking of the lateral surface of the sole of the foot (as with the end of a key) to elicit the plantar reflex normally causes plantarflexion of the great toe and probably of the other toes as well. Extension of the great toe—the extensor response (Babinski&rsquo;s sign)—indicates an upper motor neuron lesion, and is one of the cardinal signs of clinical medicine (p. 625). Note</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.20</strong> Examples of spinal reflex pathways. A The two neurons of a stretch reflex (tendon jerk), which is monosynaptic. B A multisynaptic reflex arc; only one interneuron is shown but there may be several. C The three neurons of a sympathetic reflex, showing the different positions of cell bodies compared with B: that of the preganglionic cell in the lateral grey horn of the spinal cord (instead of the posterior horn), and that of the postganglionic cell in a sympathetic ganglion (instead of the anterior horn). Note that the sympathetic preganglionic fibre runs in the white ramus communicans (which is the more distal connexion of the ganglion) and the postganglionic fibre in the grey ramus. D The fusimotor neuron loop; the γ efferent neuron, under the influence of higher centres, stimulates the muscle spindle from which afferent fibres pass back to the spinal cord to synapse with the α motor neuron.</p><p>that in infants under 1 year old the extensor response is the normal response; only with myelination of the corticospinal tracts during the second year does the normal plantar reflex become flexor.</p><p>The abdominal reflex is elicited by lightly stroking across each quadrant of the anterior abdominal wall. Normally there is contraction of the underlying muscles, but the reflexes are absent in upper motor neuron lesions. Patients with paraplegia who are lying down may exhibit Beevor&rsquo;s sign: when trying to lift the shoulders, the umbilicus is displaced upwards, due to weakness of the muscles below the umbilicus.</p><p>The anal reflex (anal wink) is a visible contraction of the external anal sphincter following pinprick of the perianal skin, and the bulbocavernosus reflex is a contraction of this sphincter (palpable per rectum) on squeezing the glans penis. Both depend on intact sacral segments of the cord (mainly S3).</p><h2 id=autonomic-nervous-system>AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM
<a class=anchor href=#autonomic-nervous-system>#</a></h2><p>The topographical anatomy of the various parts of the autonomic nervous system will be considered in the appropriate regions of the body, but the system itself can best be understood by reviewing it as a whole.</p><p>The motor part of the somatic nervous system is concerned with the innervation of skeletal muscle. The cell bodies are either in the motor nuclei of cranial nerves or the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord, and the nerve fibres which leave the central nervous system run uninterruptedly to the muscles, ending as motor endplates on the muscle fibres. The motor part of the autonomic nervous system is concerned with the innervation of cardiac and smooth muscle and glands, and the great difference between this and the somatic system is that the pathway from nerve cells in the central nervous system to the target organ is interrupted by synapses in a ganglion. There are thus two sets of neurons which are logically called preganglionic and postganglionic. The preganglionic cell bodies are always within the central nervous system. If sympathetic, they are in the lateral horn cells of all the thoracic and the upper two lumbar segments of the spinal cord; this is the thoracolumbar part of the autonomic nervous system (the thoracolumbar outflow). If parasympathetic, they are in certain cranial nerve nuclei and in lateral horn cells of sacral segments of the spinal cord; this is the craniosacral part of the autonomic nervous system (the craniosacral outflow).</p><p>The postganglionic cell bodies are in ganglia in the peripheral nervous system. If sympathetic, the ganglia are either in the sympathetic trunk, where they are collectively called paravertebral ganglia, or in certain other ganglia collectively called collateral ganglia (such as the coeliac ganglia). If parasympathetic, the ganglia are collectively called terminal ganglia; they are usually within the walls of the viscera concerned, or, in the case of certain head and neck structures, in four ganglia which are some little distance from the structures innervated.</p><h2 id=sympathetic-nervous-system>Sympathetic nervous system
<a class=anchor href=#sympathetic-nervous-system>#</a></h2><p>Having reached a sympathetic trunk ganglion, the incoming preganglionic fibres have one of three possible synaptic alternatives. The commonest is for them to synapse with cell bodies in a trunk ganglion either in the one they entered (Fig. 1.22A), or to run up or down the trunk to some other trunk ganglion. The second alternative is to leave the trunk ganglion without synapsing and to pass to a collateral ganglion for synapse (Fig. 1.22B). The third possibility (which applies only to a small number of fibres) is that they leave the trunk (without synapsing) to pass to the suprarenal gland, where certain cells of the medulla can be regarded as modified ganglion cells (p. 372).</p><p>Because there is no sympathetic outflow from the cervical part of the cord, nor from the lower lumbar and sacral parts, those preganglionic fibres which are destined to synapse with cell bodies whose fibres are going to run with cervical nerves must ascend in the sympathetic trunk to cervical ganglia, and those for lower lumbar and sacral nerves must descend in the trunk to lower lumbar and sacral ganglia.</p><p>The segmental levels of the preganglionic cell bodies concerned with the innervation of the different regions of the body (via postganglionic neurons) are indicated in Figure 1.23. In general the body is represented upright from head to perineum but with overlaps and individual variations. Thus although the neurons concerned with the innervation of the upper limb are shown as being in the lateral grey horns of segments T1-6, those from T1 segment mostly pass to postganglionic cells which innervate head and neck structures; in only 10% of individuals are T1 cells involved in the sympathetic supply to the upper limb, but the lowest level involved may be as low as T10.</p><p>The sympathetic trunk extends alongside the vertebral column from the base of the skull to the coccyx. Theoretically there is a ganglion for each spinal nerve, but fusion occurs, especially in the cervical region where the upper four unite to form the superior cervical ganglion, the fifth and sixth form the middle cervical ganglion, and the seventh and eighth fuse as the inferior cervical ganglion (and often with the first thoracic ganglion as well to form the cervicothoracic or stellate ganglion). Elsewhere there is usually one ganglion less than the number of nerves: 11 thoracic, 4 lumbar and 4 sacral.</p><p>The fibres from the lateral horn cells of each segment of the spinal cord leave in the anterior nerve root (with the axons of anterior horn cells) to reach the spinal nerve and its anterior ramus. The connecting links to the sympathetic trunk and its ganglia are the rami communicantes. There are normally two rami; the white ramus communicans is the more distal of the two (Fig. 1.21), and this is the one containing the preganglionic fibres (which are myelinated, hence called white). The other, the grey ramus communicans, contains efferent postganglionic fibres (which are unmyelinated, hence grey). The fibres in the grey ramus are those that are distributed via the branches of the spinal nerve to blood vessels, sweat glands and arrector pili muscles</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.21</strong> Connexions of a typical sympathetic trunk ganglion. Every ganglion has a grey ramus and a visceral branch. Only those from T1 to L2 have a white ramus.</p><p>(i.e. they are vasomotor, sudomotor and pilomotor). Every spinal nerve receives a grey ramus. All the thoracic and the upper two lumbar nerves also give off white rami, but the cervical, lower lumbar and sacral nerves do not have white rami, because there is no sympathetic outflow from these segments of the cord. The ganglia with which these nerves are connected by their grey rami receive their preganglionic fibres from thoracolumbar lateral horn cells whose fibres after entering the sympathetic trunk have run up or down in it (see above). Because of the fusion of ganglia, the superior cervical ganglion gives off four grey rami, and the other cervical ganglia two each. Occasional other rami (both grey and white) may be duplicated.</p><p>Each sympathetic trunk ganglion has a collateral or visceral branch (Fig. 1.21), usually called a splanchnic nerve in the thoracic, lumbar and sacral regions but in the cervical region called a cardiac branch because it proceeds to the cardiac plexus. The visceral branches generally arise high up and descend steeply to form plexuses for the viscera (Fig. 1.22). Thus cardiac branches arise from the three cervical ganglia to descend into the mediastinum to the cardiac plexus, which is supplemented by fibres from upper thoracic ganglia. From the lower thoracic ganglia the three splanchnic nerves pierce the diaphragm to reach the coeliac plexus, from the upper lumbar ganglia the lumbar splanchnic nerves descend to the superior hypogastric plexus and this divides to enter the left and right inferior hypogastric plexuses. The inferior hypogastric plexuses (collectively forming the pelvic plexus) are joined by visceral branches from all the sacral ganglia (sacral splanchnic nerves). (Do not confuse sacral splanchnic nerves which are sympathetic with pelvic splanchnic nerves which are parasympathetic—p. 33).</p><p>The sympathetic visceral plexuses thus formed are joined by parasympathetic nerves (vagus down to the coeliac plexus, pelvic splanchnics (S2, 3, 4) to the inferior hypogastric plexuses; see Figs 5.45, p. 365 and 5.63, p. 399). The mixed visceral plexuses reach the viscera by branches that hitch-hike along the relevant arteries.</p><p>In addition to the visceral branches, which supply not only the smooth muscle and glands of viscera but also the blood vessels of those viscera, all trunk ganglia give off vascular branches to adjacent large blood vessels. The cervical ganglia give branches to the carotid arteries and their branches, including (from the superior cervical ganglion) the internal carotid nerve(s), running upwards on the artery of that name to form the internal carotid plexus on the artery as it enters the skull. The thoracic and lumbar ganglia give filaments to the various parts of the aortic plexus and its derivatives, including those along the common iliac and median sacral arteries, and branches from the sacral ganglia pass to the lateral and median sacral arteries. Note that although the head and neck arteries receive direct branches from cervical trunk ganglia, limb vessels get their sympathetic innervation by nerve fibres that run with the adjacent peripheral nerves before passing to the vessels; the fibres do not run long distances along the vessels themselves. Thus the nerve filaments to the vessels of the tip of a finger or toe run not with the digital arteries but with the digital nerves, and only leave the nerves near the actual site of innervation.</p><p>During development not all ganglion cells succeed in reaching trunk or collateral ganglia, and some may unexpectedly end up as intraneural ganglia in various nerve trunks (e.g. the accessory ganglion in Fig. 5.44, p. 364). Such ganglia may, at least in some cases, account for the anomalous results of some sympathectomies.</p><h2 id=afferent-sympathetic-fibres>Afferent sympathetic fibres
<a class=anchor href=#afferent-sympathetic-fibres>#</a></h2><p>Many afferent fibres hitch-hike along sympathetic efferent pathways. Some form the afferent limb for unconscious reflex activities; others are concerned with visceral pain. All have their cell bodies in the posterior root ganglia of spinal nerves (not in sympathetic ganglia), at approximately the same segmental level as the preganglionic cells (Fig. 1.23). The peripheral processes of the sensory cells, coming from whatever structure received the efferent innervation (usually its vascular supply), run through any plexus or collateral ganglion with which the efferent fibres were involved, and then enter the sympathetic trunk (Fig. 1.22C). From there the fibres reach the spinal nerve via the</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.23</strong> Spinal levels of sympathetic preganglionic cells. There may be considerable individual variations, especially for the upper limb. See text for explanation.</p><p>white ramus communicans and then join the posterior root ganglion, from which central processes enter the spinal cord by the posterior nerve root (like any other afferent fibres). Visceral pain fibres enter the posterior horn, and thereafter the pain pathway is the same as that for spinal nerve pain fibres (p. 624). Others concerned with reflex activities may synapse with interneurons in the cord or ascend to the hypothalamus and other higher centres by pathways that are not defined.</p><p>For the control of excessive sweating and vasoconstriction in the limbs, parts of the sympathetic trunk with appropriate ganglia can be removed to abolish the normal sympathetic influence. In cervical sympathectomy for the upper limb (so called because it is usually carried out through the neck, not because any cervical part of the trunk is removed), the second and third thoracic ganglia with their rami and the intervening part of the trunk are resected. The first thoracic ganglion is not removed, since the preganglionic fibres for the upper limb do not usually arise above T2 level (see above), and its removal would result in Horner&rsquo;s syndrome (p. 519). Cervical sympathectomy is described on page 280.</p><p>For lumbar sympathectomy the third and fourth lumbar ganglia and the intervening trunk are removed; preganglionic fibres do not arise below L2 level. The first lumbar ganglion should be preserved otherwise ejaculation may be compromised; the exact positions of the ganglia vary, and they have no constant relation to the lumbar vertebrae. Lumbar sympathectomy is described on page 365.</p><h2 id=parasympathetic-nervous-system>PARASYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM
<a class=anchor href=#parasympathetic-nervous-system>#</a></h2><p>Although all parts of the body receive a sympathetic supply, the distribution of parasympathetic fibres is wholly visceral and not to the trunk or limbs. However, not all viscera are so innervated; the suprarenal glands and the gonads appear to have only a sympathetic supply.</p><p>The preganglionic fibres of cranial origin (see below) have their cell bodies either in the accessory (Edinger-Westphal) oculomotor nucleus, the superior and inferior salivary nuclei, or the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. The postganglionic cells for the first three of the above groups are in the four parasympathetic ganglia, discussed below. The vagal fibres synapse with postganglionic cell bodies in the walls of the viscera supplied (heart, lungs and gut).</p><p>The preganglionic fibres of sacral origin arise from cells in the lateral grey horn of sacral segments 2–4 of the spinal cord, and constitute the pelvic splanchnic nerves. Leaving the anterior rami of the appropriate sacral nerves near the anterior sacral foramina they pass forwards to enter into the formation of the inferior hypogastric plexuses (pelvic plexus). From there they run to pelvic viscera and to the hindgut as far up as the splenic flexure. Fibres reach the viscera either by running along their blood vessels or making their own way retroperitoneally, and they synapse around postganglionic cell bodies in the walls of these viscera.</p><h2 id=cranial-parasympathetic-ganglia>Cranial parasympathetic ganglia
<a class=anchor href=#cranial-parasympathetic-ganglia>#</a></h2><p>The four ganglia—ciliary, pterygopalatine, submandibular and otic—are very similar in plan. Each has parasympathetic, sympathetic and sensory roots, and branches of distribution (Fig. 1.24). The roots and branches are described in general terms below; the topographical details of each ganglion are dealt with in the regions concerned, but a summary of</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.24</strong> Plan of connexions of cranial parasympathetic ganglia. Only the parasympathetic root relays in the ganglion.</p><p>their connexions is given here (for reference rather than memorizing at this stage) and illustrated in Figure 1.25.</p><p>The parasympathetic root carries the preganglionic fibres from the cells of origin in a brainstem nucleus. This is the essential functional root of the ganglion; its fibres synapse in it, whereas the fibres of all other roots simply pass through the ganglion without synapse. (This parasympathetic root is sometimes called the motor root, but the sympathetic fibres are of course also motor in their own way.)</p><p>The sympathetic root contains postganglionic fibres from the superior cervical ganglion, whose preganglionic cell bodies are in the lateral grey horn of cord segments T1-3.</p><p>The sensory root contains the peripheral processes of cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglion.</p><p>The branches of each ganglion carry the postganglionic parasympathetic fibres to the particular structure(s) requiring this kind of localized motor innervation: ciliary muscle and sphincter pupillae from the ciliary ganglion, salivary glands from the submandibular and otic ganglia, and lacrimal, nasal and palatal glands from the pterygopalatine ganglion.

<a class=anchor href=#parasympathetic-afferent-fibres>#</a></h2><p>As in the sympathetic nervous system, afferent fibres often accompany the parasympathetic supply to various structures. Such fibres that run with the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves have their cell bodies in the inferior ganglia of those nerves, and their central processes pass to the nucleus of the tractus solitarius, through which there are connexions with other parts of the brainstem and higher centres for the reflex control of respiration, heart rate, blood pressure, gastrointestinal activity, etc.</p><p>The pelvic splanchnic nerves also carry afferent fibres. Their cell bodies are in the posterior root ganglia of the second to fourth sacral nerves and the central processes enter the cord by the posterior nerve roots. Some make local synaptic connexions, e.g. for bladder reflexes, but others are pain fibres from pelvic viscera, which often seem to use both sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways for pain transmission, e.g. bladder and rectum.</p><p>The development of most of the organs and systems is touched upon in the text descriptions of the regions concerned. Here a very brief account of some important features of early development is included, simply to provide a background for the later notes, which are also brief; those who need further details must consult specialist texts.</p><h2 id=early-development>Early development
<a class=anchor href=#early-development>#</a></h2><p>For the first 8 weeks of the 40-week human gestation period the developing organism is an embryo; after that time it is a fetus. By the end of the embryonic period most organs have differentiated, and the changes during the fetal period are essentially those of maturation. Many but not all congenital defects are initiated in the embryo rather than the fetus.</p><p>The fertilized ovum or zygote undergoes repeated cell divisions (cleavage) to produce a mass of cells, the morula, which travels along the uterine tube towards the uterus. Further division enlarges the morula and a fluid-filled cavity (the extraembryonic coelom) appears in it; the whole structure is now a blastocyst. At this stage implantation into the uterine mucosa takes place, about 6 days after fertilization. The outer layer of cells in the blastocyst, the trophoblast, is destined to become placental. The remainder of the cells are concentrated at one end of the blastocyst to form the inner cell mass, attached to the inner layer of the trophoblast. Within this inner cell mass a further two cavities appear, amnion and yolk sac respectively (Fig. 1.26). These two bubbles within the original bubble are separated by a mass of cells, the embryonic plate, from which the tissues and organs of the embryo will differentiate. On the amniotic aspect of the embryonic plate is ectoderm, on the yolk sac aspect is endoderm. Between them is primary mesoderm, later to be added to by the appearance of so-called secondary mesoderm, derived from cells of the ectoderm. An axial rod of cells grows in from the ectoderm towards the endoderm; this is the notochord, and alongside it the embryo now possesses bilateral symmetry. On the dorsal (ectodermal, amniotic) surface of the embryonic plate the neural groove develops. Its edges unite to form the neural tube, which becomes depressed below the surface and from which the brain and spinal cord develop. Some of the cells derived from the edges of the</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.26</strong> Longitudinal section through an early embryo.</p><p>groove become isolated between the tube and the overlying ectoderm to form the neural crest. Its cells are destined to migrate to develop into a number of structures, in particular the posterior root ganglia of spinal nerves, the corresponding ganglia of cranial nerves, autonomic ganglia, the satellite cells of ganglia and the Schwann cells of peripheral nerves, and the chromaffin cells of the suprarenal medulla.</p><p>Alongside the notochord and neural tube the mesoderm lies in three longitudinal strips. That nearest the midline is the paraxial mesoderm; it becomes segmented into masses of cells called mesodermal somites (Fig. 1.27). The somites produce: (1) the sclerotome, medially, which surrounds the neural tube and notochord, producing the vertebrae and dura mater, and (2) the myotome or muscle plate, laterally, which produces the muscles of the body wall.</p><p>The intermediate strip of mesoderm is the intermediate cell mass and becomes segmented. It projects ventrally between the other two strips (Fig. 1.28). From its lateral side in craniocaudal sequence develop successively the pronephros, mesonephros and metanephros and their associated ducts—the progenitors of the urinary and genital systems. Its medial side gives rise to the gonad and the cortex of the suprarenal gland. The most lateral strip of mesoderm is the lateral plate and is unsegmented (Fig. 1.27).</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.27</strong> Dorsal view of the amniotic plate after removal of amnion (after Keith). At a slightly later stage a ventral view of this embryo would resemble Figure 1.37A.</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.28</strong> Cross-section through an embryo similar to that illustrated in Figure 1.27 but at a slightly later stage.</p><p>the more rapid growth of the dorsal (ectodermal) surface. The embryo becomes markedly convex towards the amnion and correspondingly concave towards the yolk sac. As the lateral plate curls around to enclose the yolk sac its mesoderm becomes split into two layers by a space that appears within it. The space is the beginning of the intraembryonic coelom or body cavity. The inner layer is the splanchnopleure; it is innervated by the autonomic nervous system. It encloses the yolk sac in an hourglass constriction; the part of the yolk sac outside persists in the umbilical cord as the vitellointestinal duct, the part inside the embryo becomes the alimentary canal. The outer layer of the lateral plate is the somatopleure; it is innervated by the somatic (spinal) nervous system. Into it the paraxial myotomes migrate in segments to produce the flexor and extensor muscle layers of the body wall. The coelomic cavity at first includes pleura and peritoneum in one continuum; they become separated later. The lining of the cavity is mesodermal; note that the parietal layer of these serous membranes is supplied by somatic nerves, while the visceral layer is innervated, if at all, by autonomic nerves.</p><p>The limb buds grow from the lateral plate mesoderm and their muscles develop in situ. Although the lateral plate mesoderm is unsegmented the motor fibres that grow into it from the spinal cord limb plexuses arrange their distribution in a very definite segmental pattern (p. 21).</p><p>The septum transversum consists of the mass of mesoderm lying on the cranial aspect of the coelomic cavity. Its cranial part contains the pericardial cavity, the walls of which develop into the pericardial membranes and part of the diaphragm (p. 251). It is invaded by muscles from cervical myotomes, mainly the fourth; they produce the muscle of the diaphragm. The caudal part of the septum transversum is invaded by the developing liver, which it surrounds as the ventral mesogastrium. The septum transversum later descends, taking the heart with it, to the final position of the diaphragm.</p><p>The folding of the embryo is impeded to some extent at the tail end by the presence of the body stalk, which later becomes the umbilical cord. The greatest amount of folding occurs at the head end of the embryo (Fig. 1.13). By the end of the first fortnight the forebrain capsule is folded down over the pericardium and a mouth pit, the stomodeum, shows as a dimple between the two. Within the body of the embryo the gut cavity extends headwards dorsal to the pericardium, as far forwards as the buccopharyngeal membrane, which closes the bottom of the mouth pit. The buccopharyngeal membrane breaks down and disappears so early (third week) that its former site cannot be made out with certainty in the later embryo or adult. Cranial to the site of the membrane the mouth pit is lined with ectoderm; this includes the region of all the mandibular and maxillary teeth, and probably the submandibular and sublingual glands, and perhaps even the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Rathke&rsquo;s pouch arises from this ectoderm and forms the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. Caudal to the buccopharyngeal membrane is the pharynx, lined with endoderm and lying dorsal to the pericardium.</p><p>Mesodermal condensations develop in the side walls of the primitive pharynx to form the branchial arches and they grow around towards each other ventrally, where they fuse in the midline. In this way a series of horseshoe-shaped arches (often called pharyngeal arches) comes to support the pharynx (Fig. 1.29). The most cranial arch, the mandibular, separates the mouth pit from the pericardium; as the latter moves caudally by a process of differential growth in the neck the floor of the pharynx elongates and comes successively to possess six of these arches, separated from each other at the side of the pharynx by the pharyngeal or branchial pouches (the name given to the internal grooves between the arches; the external grooves are the branchial clefts, Fig. 1.29). The fourth and fifth pouches open into the pharynx by a common groove on each side; thus there are but four pouches separating the six arches (Fig. 1.29). On the external aspect of the pharynx four ectodermal depressions correspond in</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.29</strong> Floor of the developing pharynx. The pharyngeal (branchial) arches are numbered. The foramen caecum lies in the midline between the first and second arches.</p><p>position with the four endodermal depressions within. The four thin parts, between the arches, break down in fishes to form the gill slits or gill clefts; in mammals, however, the ectoderm and endoderm not only remain intact but are actually separated by mesoderm. The mammalian arches and pouches are taken to be homologous with the gill apparatus of fish. It clarifies the understanding of much of the anatomy of the neck to consider the derivatives of the arches and of the pouches, and the midline structures derived from the floor of the primitive pharynx.</p><p>In man the fate of the arches is known in greater detail at the cranial end of the pharynx and as we proceed caudally our knowledge becomes less precise. In general it may be stated that the first arch develops into the mandible and maxilla, the second into part of the hyoid bone, the third into the remainder of the hyoid bone, and the fourth, fifth and sixth into the cartilages of the larynx. In each arch a central bar of cartilage forms and muscle differentiates from the mesoderm around it. An artery and cranial nerve are allocated to the supply of each arch and its derivatives. Vascular patterns are very changeable during development, but a nerve supply, once established, remains constant. Outgrowths from the intervening pouches, mostly glandular, are supplied by the artery and nerve of the arch nearest to their place of origin.</p><p>The derivatives of the first arch require more detailed explanation than those of the remainder, which can be noted in summary form.</p><h2 id=first-mandibular-arch>First (mandibular) arch
<a class=anchor href=#first-mandibular-arch>#</a></h2><p>The right and left halves of the first arch fuse ventrally in the midline. Chondrification in the mesoderm produces Meckel&rsquo;s cartilage. Cranially a bump appears on each side of the arch; this is the maxillary process (not derived from the cartilage). The two grow towards the midline, meet each other and the medial and lateral nasal processes, and so produce the upper jaw and palate (p. 41). The dorsal end of Meckel&rsquo;s cartilage produces the incus and malleus, the anterior ligament of the malleus and the sphenomandibular ligament (Fig. 1.30). The latter is the fibrous perichondrium of Meckel&rsquo;s cartilage, remaining after the cartilage has disappeared. The lingula at the mandibular foramen is a small persistent part of the cartilage; so too are the chin bones (ossa mentalia) occasionally seen persisting at the midline. Around the intervening part of Meckel&rsquo;s cartilage the mandible, ossifying in membrane at the sixth week, extends in two symmetrical halves. Some time after birth the cartilage disappears.</p><p>Ectodermal and endodermal derivatives of this arch are the mucous membrane and glands (but not the muscle) of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, mesodermal derivatives are the muscles of mastication (masseter, temporal and pterygoids), the mylohyoid and anterior belly of digastric, and the two tensor muscles (tensor palati and tensor tympani)—in a word, all the muscles supplied by the mandibular nerve, which also has sensory fibres. But the taste buds of the anterior part of the tongue are supplied by the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve, which is the nerve of the second arch (see below). How does this come about? The answer is derived from studies of comparative anatomy. The chorda tympani is regarded as the pretrematic branch of the second arch nerve. The word trema means a cleft, and the</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.30</strong> Derivatives of the first arch cartilage.</p><p>sensory nerves of branchial arches (in those vertebrates that have gill clefts) divide to supply tissue in front of and behind each arch, i.e. they divide into pretrematic and post-trematic branches. Thus the chorda tympani, the pretrematic branch of the second arch nerve, supplies some sensory fibres to the first arch, and is generally recognized as the human counterpart of a more primitive vertebrate pattern. The artery is the first aortic arch, part of which persists as the maxillary artery (Fig. 1.36). Note that the first arch, often called mandibular, gives origin to the maxillary process, and this has its own sensory nerve, the maxillary branch of the trigeminal.</p><h2 id=other-arches>Other arches
<a class=anchor href=#other-arches>#</a></h2><p>The skeletal and muscular derivatives of the remaining arches can be summarized as follows:</p><p>Skeletal derivatives: stapes, styloid process, stylohyoid ligament, lesser horn and upper part of body of hyoid bone (Fig. 1.31).</p><p>Muscular derivatives: muscles of facial expression (including buccinator and platysma), stapedius, stylohyoid, posterior belly of digastric—all supplied by the facial, the nerve of the second arch.</p><p>Skeletal derivatives: thyroid, cricoid, epiglottic and arytenoid cartilages.</p><p>Muscular derivatives: intrinsic muscles of larynx, muscles of pharynx, levator palati—all supplied by laryngeal and pharyngeal branches of the vagus, the nerve of these arches.</p><h2 id=lateral-derivatives-of-the-branchial-pouches>Lateral derivatives of the branchial pouches
<a class=anchor href=#lateral-derivatives-of-the-branchial-pouches>#</a></h2><p>Except for the first, each pouch grows laterally into a dorsal and a ventral diverticulum.</p><p>First pouch. This is the only pouch in which ectoderm and endoderm remain in close apposition, namely at the tympanic membrane, where the mesoderm separating them is minimal. In the other pouches the ectoderm and endoderm are finally widely separated. The endoderm of the first pouch is prolonged laterally, via the auditory tube, to form the middle ear and mastoid antrum (the second pouch gives a contribution to the middle ear—see below). The (external) branchial groove becomes deepened to form the external acoustic meatus.</p><p>Second pouch. The dorsal diverticulum assists the first pouch in the formation of the tympanic cavity, taking what may be its pretrematic nerve (the tympanic branch of the glossopharyngeal) with it. The ventral diverticulum of the pouch develops the tonsillar crypts and the supratonsillar fossa from its endoderm, the surrounding mesoderm contributing the lymphatic tissue of the palatine tonsil. The nerve supply of these derivatives is the glossopharyngeal, overlapped in part by the facial.</p><p>Third pouch. Dorsally the inferior parathyroid gland (often called parathyroid III) and ventrally the thymic rudiment grow from this pouch. The latter progresses caudally and joins with that of the other side to produce the bilobed thymus gland. In its descent the thymic bud draws parathyroid III in a caudal direction, so that ultimately the latter lies inferior to parathyroid IV, which is derived from the fourth pouch. Externally the cervical sinus overlies the pouch and it is probable that some of the thymic rudiment is derived from the ectoderm thereof. From this thymic bud the medulla of the thymic lobule, including the thymic (Hassall&rsquo;s) corpuscles, is derived; the lymphocytes of the cortex originally migrated from bone marrow.</p><p>Fourth pouch. Dorsally the superior parathyroid glands (parathyroid IV) are derived from the endodermal lining of this pouch. Ventrally the pouch is attached to the thyroid gland, thus preventing parathyroid IV (the superior parathyroid of the adult) from descending, and probably makes a contribution to the thymus.</p><p>Fifth pouch. This undergoes regression and is now considered to form the ultimobranchial body, from which are derived the parafollicular (C) cells of the thyroid gland which produce calcitonin.</p><h2 id=cervical-sinus>Cervical sinus
<a class=anchor href=#cervical-sinus>#</a></h2><p>Concurrently with the growth of the above derivatives from the endoderm of the pouches a change takes place externally in the overlying ectoderm. The second arch increases in thickness and grows caudally, covering in the third, fourth and sixth arches and meeting skin caudally to these. Thus a deep groove is formed, which becomes a deep pit, the cervical sinus. The lips of the pit meet and fuse and the imprisoned ectoderm disappears. Persistence of this ectoderm gives rise to a branchial cyst. A branchial fistula sometimes results from breaking down of the endoderm in, usually, the second pouch; the track then runs from the region of the tonsil, between the external and internal carotid arteries (Fig. 1.36), and reaches the skin anterior to the lower end of sternocleidomastoid.</p><p>It is this formation of the cervical sinus and subsequent obliteration of ectoderm that joins skin over the mandible (mandibular branch of the trigeminal) to neck skin (C2).

The thyroid gland buds from the duct&rsquo;s distal end (p. 432), which itself may give rise to the pyramidal lobe. Other remnants of the duct may persist and give rise to cysts, commonly behind the body of the hyoid bone; the duct is kinked by the hyoid bone growing downwards (Fig. 1.32). Rarely the duct may pass behind or even through the bone.</p><p>In the ventral wall of the oesophagus a laryngotracheal groove appears. The cephalic end of this gutter is limited by the furcula, a ridge in the shape of a wish-</p><p>Thyrohyoid membrane</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.32</strong> Course of the thyroglossal duct. If a remnant persists it usually does so at the kink behind the body of the hyoid bone.</p><p>bone which lies in the caudal part of the floor of the pharynx (Fig. 1.29). The ridges which limit the gutter grow towards each other and, by their fusion, convert the gutter into a tube. This tube, the trachea, then separates from the oesophagus and buds out into the bronchi and lungs at its caudal end. The process of fusion does not, of course, affect the furcula, which persists at the aperture of the larynx whose cartilages, including that of the epiglottis, derive from the underlying fourth and sixth pharyngeal arches.</p><h2 id=branchial-arch-arteries>Branchial arch arteries
<a class=anchor href=#branchial-arch-arteries>#</a></h2><p>From the cephalic end of the primitive heart tube (p. 44) a ventral aorta divides right and left into two branches which curve back caudally as the two dorsal aortae which are essentially continued into the two umbilical arteries. As the branchial arches develop a vessel in each arch joins the ventral to the dorsal aortae. Thus six aortic arches are to be accounted for (Fig. 1.33-1.36).</p><p>The first and second arch arteries disappear early, their only remnants in the adult being the maxillary and stapedial arteries respectively. The fifth disappears entirely. The third remains as part of the internal carotid artery. The fourth on the right persists as the subclavian artery, on the left as the arch of the aorta. By the time the sixth artery appears the upper bulbar part of the heart tube has been divided into aorta and pulmonary trunk (p. 276). It is to the pulmonary trunk that the sixth arch arteries are connected ventrally (Fig. 1.34). Dorsally they communicate with the dorsal aortae. The pulmonary arteries grow out from the sixth arch. The dorsal part of the sixth arch</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.33</strong> Arteries of the first four pharyngeal arches viewed from the left (an enlargement of the rectangular area shown in the small figure).

Coarctation of the aorta (narrowing) is due to a defect of the tunica media which forms a shelf-like projection into the lumen, most commonly in the region of the ductus; collateral circulation distal to the obstruction is provided by the internal thoracic and posterior intercostal arteries. An abnormal origin of the right subclavian artery (just distal to the origin of the left one) occurs when the right fourth aortic arch disappears and the distal part of the right dorsal aorta persists. The artery passes behind the oesophagus and is a possible cause of dysphagia, but may be more important surgically because, with the lack of a normal right subclavian arch, the right recurrent laryngeal nerve is not recurrent and runs down the side of the larynx—a possible hazard in thyroidectomy. The reported incidence varies from 1–2%.</p><p>Several kinds of uncommon defect occur when arches persist instead of becoming obliterated or vice versa (refer to the normal pattern seen in Fig. 1.35). A right aortic arch occurs when the left fourth arch and dorsal aorta disappear. If the left fourth arch alone (and not the dorsal aorta as well) disappears, the condition of interrupted arch arises; the first part of the arch gives off the brachiocephalic and left common carotid vessels, and beyond the gap the pulmonary trunk and a persistent patent ductus (sixth arch) are required to complete an arch with the left dorsal aorta. If the right dorsal aorta persists as well as the left, a double arch ensues with the trachea and oesophagus clasped between the two.</p><h2 id=development-of-mouth-and-face>DEVELOPMENT OF MOUTH AND FACE

The frontonasal process and the beginning of mandibular and hyoid arches appear in the fourth week, when the embryo is 3 mm long. The teeth begin as the dental lamina at the sixth week, when the embryo is 12 mm long. Calcification of the first dentine, soon followed by the enamel, begins in the fifth month.</p><p>The stomodeum is bounded by the mandibular arch, which produces the floor of the mouth, lower jaw and lower lip, and the two maxillary processes. Its cranial boundary is the forebrain capsule (Fig. 1.37A), from which the frontonasal process grows.

The median process is characterized by a pair of convex globular processes (Fig. 1.37B). The lateral nasal processes unite with them to encircle the nostril. The maxillary and lateral nasal processes encircle the eye and meet together along the line of the nasolacrimal duct (Fig. 1.37C).

The whole of the upper lip, including the philtrum, is derived in man from the maxillary processes. The derivatives of the frontonasal process are supplied by the ophthalmic nerve (upper branch of the trigeminal), those of the maxillary process by the maxillary nerve (middle branch of the trigeminal), and those of the mandibular arch by the mandibular nerve (lowest branch of the trigeminal).</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.38</strong> Hard palates of man and monkey compared.

In the monkey the premaxilla lies on the face.</p><p>The upper part of the face is completed by fusion of the frontonasal and maxillary processes in the above manner, but at first the face is only a mask, for behind it the nasal septum and palate have yet to be completed. The developing tongue lies against the floor of the cranium. A midline flange (the nasal septum) grows down from the base of the forebrain capsule (which is the mesenchymal precursor of the skull). From each maxillary process a flange known as the palatal process grows medially across the dorsum of the tongue. The two palatal processes and the nasal septum meet and unite from before backwards, thus separating the nasal cavities from each other and from the mouth. So is formed the nasal capsule, in mesoderm. Chondrification of the nasal capsule occurs, and by the sixth week the nasal walls and hard palate are outlined by a thin layer of hyaline cartilage. Ossification of the cartilaginous nasal capsule begins almost at once, spreading from several centres. In the upper part of the wall of the nose the hyaline cartilage is itself replaced by bone, but in the lower part of the septum and in the hard palate there is a deposition of membrane bone on each surface of the hyaline cartilage. The cartilage, thus sandwiched between two layers of membrane bone, is not absorbed until some time after birth.</p><p>The nerve supply of all these structures, inside and outside, is derived from the fifth cranial (trigeminal) nerve.

<a class=anchor href=#defects-of-development>#</a></h2><p>The commonest abnormalities are harelip and cleft palate (1 in 1000 and 1 in 2500 births respectively) which may or may not coexist. Harelip is almost always lateral; the cleft runs down from the nostril. The median part of the lip is derived in these cases from the opposite maxillary process or, perhaps, from the frontonasal process which latter normally does not produce any part of the upper lip. Harelip may be bilateral, in which case the central part of the lip, between the two clefts, is obviously derived, abnormally, from the frontonasal process.</p><p>Cleft palate may be partial or complete. The two palatal processes unite with each other (and with the nasal septum) from before backwards. Arrest of union thus results in a posterior defect that varies from the mildest form of bifid uvula to a complete cleft from uvula to gum margin. In the latter case the cleft almost always runs between premaxilla and maxilla and involves the jaw between the lateral incisor and canine teeth. Irregular formations of incisor and canine teeth, however, often accompany these defects of palatal development. Very rarely a midline cleft may separate the two halves of the premaxilla.</p><p>A less common defect arises from the failure of fusion of the lateral nasal process with the maxillary process, producing a groove (facial cleft) on the face along the line of the nasolacrimal duct. Reduplication of various forms produces monsters, completely two-headed or less grotesque, while fusion results in such conditions as cyclopia.</p><h2 id=development-of-the-cloaca>DEVELOPMENT OF THE CLOACA

From the dorsal wall of the allantois, the urorectal septum grows downwards to meet the cloacal membrane, so dividing the cloaca and membrane into two (Fig. 1.39B): at the front, the urogenital sinus and urogenital membrane, and at the back the anorectal canal and the anal membrane, which lies in a small ectodermal depression, the proctodeum.

At the front of the urogenital membrane (which breaks down) is a midline mesodermal swelling, the genital tubercle (Fig. 1.39B), which becomes the clitoris or the glans penis. Leading back from the tubercle on either side are the urogenital folds, which in the female remain separate as the labia minora. In the male they unite at the back to form the midline raphe of the scrotum, the rest of the scrotum coming from the pair of genital (labioscrotal) swellings which develop lateral to the urogenital folds and which in the female become the labia majora. The front parts of the urogenital folds unite from the scrotum forwards as the ventral part of the penis and penile urethra.</p><p>The origin of the pulmonary trunk and of the aorta and its main branches to the head and neck have been covered with the branchial arches (above). For the rest of the vascular system, some introductory remarks must be made on early heart development and the origins of the major veins.</p><p>Primitive blood vessels are laid down by angioblasts on the wall of the yolk sac. Two such vessels fuse together to make a single heart tube which develops muscle</p><p>INTRODUCTION TO REGIONAL ANATOMY</p><p>fibres in its wall and becomes pulsatile. It differentiates into four parts or cavities which in a cephalocaudad direction are the bulb, ventricle, atrium and sinus venosus. The tube grows at a greater rate than the cavity (the primitive pericardium) in which it is suspended; it therefore has to bend, and it does so in such a way that the bulb and the ventricle come to lie in front of the atrium and sinus venosus. There is also a slight twisting of the bulb to the right and the ventricle to the left, hence the normal left-sided bulging of the definitive heart.</p><p>The upper part of the bulb is the truncus arteriosus, which divides to become the aorta and pulmonary trunk. The lower part of the bulb becomes most of the right ventricle, with the original ventricle forming most of the left ventricle. The atrium becomes divided into two, with the sinus venosus becoming mostly absorbed into the right atrium. These later changes are described on page 275.</p><h2 id=development-of-veins>Development of veins
<a class=anchor href=#development-of-veins>#</a></h2><p>From a network of primitive veins, certain longitudinal channels develop to return blood to the sinus venosus. It receives blood from three sources: from the placenta by umbilical veins, from the yolk sac (which becomes the alimentary canal) by vitelline veins, and from the general tissues of the embryo by cardinal veins. In each group there are right and left veins, with anastomosing cross-channels between each pair, and the whole or part of one longitudinal vein of each pair disappears—right umbilical, left vitelline and left cardinal.</p><p>The left umbilical vein joins the left branch of the portal vein, but its blood short-circuits the liver by passing along a venous shunt, the ductus venosus, which joins the end of the right vitelline vein on the cranial side of the liver. After birth the left umbilical vein and its continuation the ductus venosus become reduced to fibrous cords, the ligamentum teres and ligamentum venosum.</p><p>The fate of the vitelline veins, which with their cross-channels contribute to the formation of the portal vein and the upper end of the inferior vena cava, is considered with the portal vein (p. 351).</p><p>On each side, a vein from the head and neck (internal jugular) and from the upper limb (subclavian) unite to form the anterior cardinal vein. Similarly, from the lower limb and pelvis, external and internal iliac veins form the posterior cardinal vein, into which drain segmental veins (intercostal and lumbar). The two cardinals unite to form the common cardinal vein (the duct of Cuvier of comparative anatomy). The essential features of subsequent changes are the obliteration of the left anterior and posterior cardinals, with the persistence of a cross-channel at each end of the body—the left brachiocephalic vein and the left common iliac vein.</p><p>In the thorax the right anterior cardinal vein forms the right brachiocephalic and the superior vena cava as far as the entry of the azygos vein (derived from the right posterior cardinal). On the left a hemiazygos system develops to replace the vanished left posterior cardinal vein.</p><p>In the abdomen the fate of the posterior cardinal veins is more complicated, since other longitudinal channels appear both medial (subcardinal) and dorsal (supracardinal) to the original posterior cardinal. The end result is the formation of the inferior vena cava and its tributaries from different parts of these vessels and their intercommunications. Details can be found in embryological texts, but for most students they are an unnecessary burden, although they do of course provide explanations for the asymmetry of the vena caval tributaries and venous anomalies. Suffice it to say here that in the lower abdomen the common iliac veins are behind the corresponding arteries, but higher up the renal veins are in front of the renal arteries, due to the venous development from dorsal or ventral channels—iliacs from dorsal, renals from ventral. It should also be noted that the so-called left-sided inferior vena cava is only left-sided in its lower part; its upper end is still to the right of the aorta but the lower part joins the left renal vein which may cross either in front of or behind the aorta.</p><p>The proportions of the newborn child differ markedly from the form of the adult. Some of its organs and structures are well developed and even of full adult size (e.g. the internal ear) while others have yet to develop (e.g. corticospinal tracts to become myelinated, teeth to erupt, secondary sex characters to appear).</p><p>It is proposed to consider several features of a general nature, followed by accounts of certain special parts of the body, but before doing so it seems convenient to discuss first the circulatory changes which take place in the neonatus at the time of birth.</p><p>The fetal blood is oxygenated in the placenta, not in the lungs. The economy of the fetal circulation is improved by three short-circuiting arrangements, all of which cease to function at the time of birth: the ductus venosus, the foramen ovale and the ductus arteriosus.</p><h2 id=ductus-venosus>Ductus venosus
<a class=anchor href=#ductus-venosus>#</a></h2><p>Oxygenated blood returns from the placenta by the (left) umbilical vein, which joins the left branch of the portal vein in the porta hepatis. This oxygenated blood short-circuits the sinusoids of the liver; it is conveyed directly to the inferior vena cava by the ductus venosus. This channel lies along the inferior surface of the liver, between the attached layers of the lesser omentum. After birth, when blood no longer flows along the thrombosed umbilical vein, the blood in the ductus venosus clots and the ductus venosus becomes converted into a fibrous cord, the ligamentum venosum, lying deep in the cleft bounding the caudate lobe of the liver. The intra-abdominal part of the umbilical vein persists as a fibrous cord, the ligamentum teres. The two are continuous.</p><h2 id=foramen-ovale>Foramen ovale
<a class=anchor href=#foramen-ovale>#</a></h2><h2 id=ductus-arteriosus>Ductus arteriosus
<a class=anchor href=#ductus-arteriosus>#</a></h2><p>It has already been noted that oxygenated blood in the umbilical vein passes via the ductus venosus, inferior vena cava and right atrium through the foramen ovale to the left side of the heart and so to the head. Venous blood from the head is returned by way of the brachiocephalic veins to the superior vena cava. In the right atrium this venous blood stream crosses the stream of oxygenated blood brought there via the inferior vena cava. The two streams of blood scarcely mix with each other. The deoxygenated blood from the superior vena cava passes through the right atrium into the right ventricle and so into the pulmonary trunk. It now short-circuits the airless lungs by the ductus arteriosus. This is a thick artery joining the left branch of the pulmonary trunk to the aorta, distal to the origin of the three branches of the aortic arch. The deoxygenated blood thus passes distally along the aorta and via the umbilical arteries to the placenta to be reoxygenated.</p><p>After birth the ductus arteriosus is occluded by contraction of its muscular walls. It persists as a fibrous band, the ligamentum arteriosum, which connects the commencement of the left pulmonary artery to the concavity of the arch of the aorta. After the closure of the ductus blood from the right ventricle perforce circulates through the lungs.</p><h2 id=general-features-of-the-newborn>GENERAL FEATURES OF THE NEWBORN
<a class=anchor href=#general-features-of-the-newborn>#</a></h2><p>Of all the mammalian newborn the human is perhaps the least graceful. Kittens and puppies, lambs and foals, and most other newborn mammals possess a beauty and grace in their playful movements that are lacking in the human young. Man is born in a more immature form and requires some months to reach the kitten or puppy stage.</p><p>In comparison with the adult the neonatus is much more fully developed at its head end than at its tail end. The large head and massive shoulders stand out in marked contrast to the smallish abdomen and poorly developed buttocks and lower limbs. The edentulous jaws and shallow maxillae combine to produce a face short in its vertical extent, with the cheeks bulging forwards to accommodate their tissues. The bulging cheeks of the baby face are not entirely lost until eruption of the permanent teeth and the rapid increase in size of the maxillary sinuses between the ages of 6 and 7 years.</p><p>The newborn baby has no visible neck; its lower jaw and chin touch its shoulders and thorax. Gradually the neck elongates and the chin loses contact with the chest. The head thus becomes more mobile, both in flexion-extension and in rotation.</p><p>The abdomen is not prominent at birth but becomes gradually more and more so. The pot-belly of the young child is due mainly to the large liver and the small pelvis; the pelvic organs lie in the abdominal cavity. In later childhood the pelvic organs and much of the intestinal tract sink into the developing pelvic cavity and the rate of growth of the abdominal walls outpaces that of the liver. In this way the disposition of the viscera and the contour of the abdominal wall reach the adult proportions, and the bulging belly flattens.</p><p>INTRODUCTION TO REGIONAL ANATOMY</p><p>movements are ill-controlled and ataxic. Fingers can be flexed and hyperextended and there is a very powerful grasping reflex, so that the neonatus can hold itself suspended by the grip of its hand. The hand takes many months to become the chief tactile organ—until this time the lips are used for feeling, the hand functioning merely as the prehensile organ to convey objects to the mouth for examination. The small buttocks and short legs give little indication of the form and function they will later attain.</p><p>The most striking feature of the neonatal skull is the disproportion between the cranial vault and facial skeleton; the vault is very large in proportion to the face.</p><p>In Figure 1.40 the photograph of a full-term fetal skull has been enlarged to the same vertical projection as a normal adult skull and this procedure shows in striking manner the disproportion between the two.</p><p>The rotundity of the fetal skull in comparison with the adult is mainly the result of underdevelopment of the face. The cranial vaults in this frontal view are of much the same proportions. There is a very great difference in the facial skeletons. In the fetal skull the vertical diameter of the orbit equals the vertical height of maxilla and mandible combined. In the adult skull the growth of the maxillary sinuses and the growth of alveolar bone around the permanent teeth has so elongated the face that the vertical diameter of the orbit is only one-third of the vertical height of maxilla and mandible combined.</p><p>The bones of the vault of the skull and face are developed by ossification in membrane, the base of the skull by ossification in cartilage. Most of the separate skull and face bones are ossified by the time of birth but they are mobile on each other and are fairly readily disarticulated in the macerated skull. Their mobility on each other is most marked in the vault and the ability to overlap provides that moulding of the cranium which so generally occurs during parturition.</p><p>The bones of the vault (frontal, parietal, occipital, squamous, etc.) do not interdigitate in sutures, as in the adult, but are separated by linear attachments of fibrous tissue and, at their corners, by larger areas, the fontanelles. The anterior and posterior fontanelles are the most readily examined, for they lie in the midline of the vault.</p><p>The anterior fontanelle lies between four bones. The two parietal bones bound it behind, the two halves of the frontal bone lie in front. The two halves of the frontal bone unite by the second year; the anterior fontanelle is closed by this time—clinically it is usually not palpable after the age of 18 months. The extent of the anterior fontanelle is indicated in the adult skull by relatively straight parts of the coronal and sagittal sutures (p. 644).</p><p>The posterior fontanelle lies between the apex of the squamous part of the occipital bone and the posterior edges of the two parietal bones. It is closed at the end of the first year.</p><p>Growth of the vault of the skull takes place by deposition of bone around the edges of the separate bones, which come to interdigitate with each other along the various sutures. But in addition to this appositional growth there is interstitial growth in thickness, accompanied regularly throughout by a moulding of each bone, i.e. absorption of inner surfaces of bone by osteoclasts accompanies the laying down of new external surfaces of bone by osteoblasts. An adult parietal bone, for example, is the surface of a larger sphere than that of the neonatal parietal bone, though some slight persistence of the infantile curvature is indicated at the parietal eminence. In the vault only compact bone is present at birth; with subsequent growth the interior of the bones becomes excavated into cancellous bone (the diploë), and red bone marrow fills the interstices.</p><p>The temporal bone develops in four separate pieces, two in membrane and two in cartilage. The squamous and tympanic bones develop in membrane, the petromastoid and styloid process in cartilage.</p><p>The squamous part resembles the adult and increases in size by appositional growth combined with a continuous process of moulding.</p><p>The tympanic part is present at birth as the C-shaped tympanic ring, applied to the under surface of the petrous and squamous parts and enclosing the tympanic membrane, which is slotted into it. The external acoustic meatus of the newborn is wholly cartilaginous. The tympanic membrane is almost as big as in the adult, but faces more downwards and less outwards than the adult ear drum; it therefore seems somewhat smaller and lies more obliquely when viewed through the otoscope. The tympanic ring elongates by growth from the lateral rim of its whole circumference, the tympanic plate so produced forming the bony part of the external acoustic meatus and pushing the cartilaginous part of the meatus laterally, further from the ear drum. The adult bony meatus is thus twice as long as the cartilaginous part.</p><p>As the tympanic plate grows laterally from the tympanic ring the tympanic membrane tilts and comes to face rather more laterally and less downwards than in the neonate. Growth of bone from the C-shaped tympanic ring is at first more rapid anteriorly and posteriorly, and less rapid inferiorly. The growing anterior and posterior bony flanges usually join and enclose an irregular foramen (of Huschke) between them, but subsequent growth of bone obliterates this gap.</p><p>The petromastoid or petrous part encloses the internal ear and tympanic antrum, all parts of which are full adult size at birth. The mastoid process is not developed and the stylomastoid foramen is near the lateral surface of the skull, covered by the thin fibres of sternocleidomastoid—the issuing facial nerve is thus unprotected and vulnerable at birth. The mastoid process develops with growth of the sternocleidomastoid muscle as the child commences to move its head, and air cells grow into it from the mastoid (tympanic) antrum. The mastoid process is aerated in this way at the beginning of the second year (the same time as the frontal sinus appears).</p><p>As already stated the cochlea, vestibule and semicircular canals are full adult size at birth. The middle ear is roofed in by a plate of bone, the tegmen tympani, which projects laterally from the petrous bone. At birth the tegmen tympani is not fully grown and it does not cover the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve; the ganglion is in contact with the dura mater of the middle cranial fossa. The chorda tympani leaves the middle ear and emerges from the base of the skull between the tympanic ring and the under surface of the squamous bone. As the tympanic ring grows laterally and becomes the scroll-shaped tympanic plate the chorda tympani comes to emerge between it and the squamous part of the temporal bone, i.e. through the squamotympanic fissure. By this time the tegmen tympani of the petrous part of the temporal bone has grown across the geniculate ganglion and curved downwards to form the lateral wall of the canal for the tensor tympani muscle. Its growing edge peeps out from the medial part of the squamotympanic fissure, dividing that fissure into petrosquamous in front and petrotympanic behind (Fig. 8.4, p. 646). The chorda tympani is caught behind the down-growing tegmen tympani and thus emerges from the base of the skull through the petrotympanic fissure.</p><p>The mastoid antrum is full adult size at birth and is generally covered by some 3 mm of petrous bone deep to the floor of the suprameatal triangle. After ossification of the petrosquamous suture new bone from the squamous flows down over the developing mastoid process, and at the rate of 1 mm a year buries the mastoid antrum more deeply. This growth stops at 12 years; thereafter the antrum lies 15 mm from the surface. The squamomastoid suture becomes an irregular line above the margins of the mastoid process (Fig. 6.58, p. 524).</p><p>The maxilla, between the floor of the orbit and the gum margin, is very shallow at birth and is full of developing teeth. The maxillary sinus is a narrow slit excavated into its medial wall. Eruption of the deciduous teeth allows room for excavation of the sinus beneath the orbital surface but the maxilla grows slowly until the permanent teeth begin to erupt at 6 years. At this time it puts on a spurt of growth. The rapid increase in size of the sinus and the growth of the alveolar bone occur simultaneously with increased depth of the mandible. These factors combine to produce a rapid elongation of the face.</p><p>The hard palate grows backwards to accommodate the extra teeth, but the forward growth of the base of the skull at the occipital sutures outstrips it and prevents the hard palate from approaching the cervical vertebrae. So the nasopharyngeal isthmus is kept open, and in fact increases in size. After eruption of the first permanent molar (6 years) the suture between basiocciput and the jugular part closes but forward growth of the base of the skull continues at the spheno-occipital synchondrosis and this latter does not ossify until well after the third molar is either erupted or fully formed (25 years of age).</p><p>The paranasal sinuses are rudimentary at birth. Their development and growth are considered on page 476. Growth of the face occurs by overall increase in size of all the face bones; most of the sutures slope downwards and backwards, so that growth at the sutures forces the face downwards and forwards away from the base of the skull.</p><p>The mandible is in two halves at birth; the fibrous joint (called symphysis menti, although it is not a true symphysis, being only fibrous tissue without any cartilage) between them ossifies at the end of the first year. The body of the mandible is practically full of teeth, so the mental foramen lies near its lower border. After eruption of the permanent teeth the foramen lies halfway between the upper and lower borders of the bone. In the edentulous jaw absorption of the alveolar margin leaves the mental foramen nearer the upper border of the mandible, so exposing the mental nerve to the pressure of an artificial denture (Fig. 1.41). Elongation of the body of the mandible is required to accommodate the erupting teeth and keep them in occlusion with the increasing number of maxillary teeth. Elongation of the ramus of the mandible is also required, for the jaws must separate to allow room for the eruption of the teeth. With growth in width of the face the mandible widens correspondingly. This overall</p><p>INFANT
ADULT
SENILE</p><p><strong>Fig. 1.41</strong> Age changes in the mandible. Lateral outlines of the infant, adult and senile mandibles are seen, not as dried bones resting on the table but as in the resting position in the living head (with the infant outline enlarged to adult proportions). The position of the temporomandibular joint does not change; in the senile mandible the alveolar process becomes resorbed, leaving the (unlabelled) mental foramen very near the upper margin.</p><p>growth of the mandible takes place, as in all bones of the body, by a process of moulding which results from the harmonious deposition of new bone and resorption of old bone where required. An epiphysis at the neck of the mandible (composed of secondary cartilage) allows ready moulding of the condyle of the bone for accommodation with the changing size and direction of the articular cartilage and temporal bone.</p><p>These growth changes produce alterations in the contour of the mandible that are very characteristic (Fig. 1.41). At birth the angle is obtuse and the coronoid process lies at a higher level than the condyle; the latter lies in line with the upper border of the body. The resting mandible is depressed and the tongue lies between the edentulous gums, and the adult rest position of the mandible is not reached until the age of about 2 years. After eruption of the permanent teeth the angle is more nearly a right angle, and the well-developed condyle lies higher than the coronoid process. In the edentulous mouth the angle of the mandible does not alter very significantly, but gradual moulding of the neck ultimately depresses the condyle to a lower level than the coronoid process.</p><p>These age variations in the relative upward protrusion of coronoid process and condyle are much more apparent than real, for they are measured in relation to the working position of the mandible, with the occlusal surface horizontal. In the resting position, however, the infantile and edentulous senile mandible are in each case more open than in the normal adult (Fig. 1.41), and this accounts for the apparent disproportion of the two bony processes.</p><p>The tongue is relatively large at birth and has a blunt tip that cannot be extruded. The newborn is tongue-tied and only slowly does the tip of the tongue elongate. The hard palate is high and the orifice of the auditory tube lies at the same level; as the nasal septum grows in height the palate descends and leaves the tubal orifice above it in the nasopharynx.</p><p>In common with lymphatic tissue elsewhere in the body the palatine and nasopharyngeal tonsils (adenoids) tend to be exuberant in the child. Their relatively large size should never in itself be taken as evidence of infection.</p><h2 id=neck>Neck
<a class=anchor href=#neck>#</a></h2><p>The newborn baby has a very short neck. The subsequent elongation of the neck is accompanied by growth changes in the covering skin; an incision over the lower neck in an infant usually results in the scar lying over the upper sternum by later childhood.</p><p>The left brachiocephalic vein crosses the trachea so high in the superior mediastinum that it lies above the jugular notch into the neck, especially if it is engorged and the head extended; this should be remembered by the surgeon performing tracheotomy upon the young child.</p><p>The shortness of the neck of the newborn involves a higher position of its viscera. The epiglottis and larynx lie relatively nearer the base of the tongue and their descent is slow; they reach their adult levels only after the seventh year. The larynx and trachea are of small bore at birth. The vocal cords are about 5 mm long by the end of the first year. Laryngitis and tracheitis in infancy thus carry far more risk of respiratory obstruction than they do in later years. Up to the age of puberty there is no difference between the male and female larynx. At puberty the male larynx increases rapidly in size and the vocal cords elongate from 8 to 16 mm within the year, resulting in the characteristic breaking of the voice. Castration or failure of testicular hormone prevents this change taking place.</p><h2 id=thorax>Thorax
<a class=anchor href=#thorax>#</a></h2><p>The thoracic cage of the child differs from that of the adult in being more barrel-shaped. A cross-section of the infant thorax is nearly circular; that of the adult is oval, the transverse being thrice the length of the antero-posterior diameter. The large thymus extends from the lower part of the neck through the superior into the anterior mediastinum; it regresses at puberty. The ribs lie more nearly horizontal, so the cage is set at a higher level than in the adult. This results in the shortness of the neck already noted. The high thorax involves a higher level of the diaphragm, with consequent increase of abdominal volume. Descent of the thoracic cage as the ribs take up their adult obliquity is the chief cause of the elongation of the neck.</p><h2 id=abdomen>Abdomen
<a class=anchor href=#abdomen>#</a></h2><p>At birth the liver is relatively twice as big as in the adult and its inferior border is palpable below the costal margin. The kidneys are always highly lobulated at birth with very little perinephric fat; grooves on the surface of the adult organ frequently persist as visible signs of the original fetal lobulation. The suprarenal is enormous at birth, nearly as large as the kidney itself. The caecum is conical and the appendix arises from its apex in the fetus, and this arrangement is usually still present at birth. During infancy and early childhood the lateral wall of the caecum balloons out and the base of the appendix comes to lie posteriorly on the medial wall. The appendiceal mucous membrane is packed with massed lymphoid follicles in the child. These become much more sparse in later life. The pelvic cavity is very small at birth and the fundus of the bladder lies above the pubic symphysis even when empty.</p><p>The upper limb is more fully developed than the lower limb at birth. The grasping reflex of the hand is very pronounced. Growth in length occurs more at the shoulder and wrist than at the elbow. Amputation through the humerus in a young child requires a very generous flap of soft tissue lest the growing bone should later protrude through the stump.</p><p>At birth the lower limb is not only poorly developed, but occupies the fetal position of flexion, a position which is maintained for 6 months or more. In preparation for standing and walking the limb not only becomes more robust, but undergoes an extension and medial rotation that carry the flexor compartment around to the posterior aspect of the limb. The inverted foot of the newborn gradually becomes everted harmoniously with these changes in position of the knee and hip joints. Growth of the limb proceeds more rapidly at the knee than at the hip or ankle. It is not symmetrical across the lower epiphysis of the femur, and knock-knee (genu valgum) is normal in the child.</p><p>Until birth the column is C-shaped. This is imposed by constriction in utero. After birth the column is so flexible that it readily takes on any curvature imposed by gravity. The cervical curve opens up into a ventral convexity when the infant holds up its head and the lumbar curve opens up into a ventral convexity when the infant walks. The extension of the hip that accompanies walking tilts the pelvis forwards, so that the axis of the pelvic cavity is no longer in line with that of the abdominal cavity. This forward tilt of the pelvis necessitates a high degree of forward curvature (lordosis) of the lumbar spine in order to keep the body vertical in the standing position.</p><pre tabindex=0><code></code></pre></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"><span><a href=/docs/lasts/ class="flex align-center book-icon"><img src=/svg/backward.svg class=book-icon alt=Previous title="Last's Anatomy 9th Edition">
