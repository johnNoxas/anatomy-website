The first thoracic vertebra lies at the highest part of the sloping thoracic inlet. From its upper border rises the cervical spinal column, gently convex forwards, and supporting the skull.

<a class=anchor href=#head-neck-and-spine>#</a></h1><p>The first thoracic vertebra lies at the highest part of the sloping thoracic inlet. From its upper border rises the cervical spinal column, gently convex forwards, and supporting the skull. A mass of extensor musculature lies behind the vertebrae. It is supplied segmentally by posterior rami and supports the cervical spine and head. A much smaller amount of prevertebral flexor musculature lies in front of the vertebrae and, more laterally, is attached to the thoracic inlet and the scapula. It is supplied segmentally by anterior rami. This musculature comprises longus colli, rectus capitis anterior and rectus capitis lateralis, longus capitis, scalenus anterior, scalenus medius, scalenus posterior and levator scapulae. The whole mass, projecting but little in front of the cervical spine, lies flat from side to side behind the pharynx, and from here curves away posteriorly; it is covered over by the prevertebral fascia, which thus forms a vertical sheet passing from side to side across the central part of the neck.</p><p>Mylohyoid separates the mouth from the neck. The hyoid bone and larynx are suspended by muscles from the skull. Inferiorly they are connected by muscles to the sternum and the scapula; beneath these muscles the thyroid gland, enclosed in the pretracheal fascia, lies alongside the respiratory canal. The anterior part of the neck extends no higher than the mandible, being limited by the mylohyoid. Above this level the face extends to the base of the skull. Further back the neck extends as high as the base of the skull; on each side of the pharynx is a carotid sheath, with the cervical sympathetic trunk behind it. Emerging into the neck are the ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth cranial nerves. Finally, surrounding the whole neck is a collar of fascia, the investing layer of deep cervical fascia, which contains the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles.</p><h2 id=deep-cervical-fascia>Deep Cervical Fascia
<a class=anchor href=#deep-cervical-fascia>#</a></h2><p>The deep cervical fascia consists of four parts: the investing layer, pretracheal fascia, prevertebral fascia, and the carotid sheath.</p><p>This fascia, comparable in every way to the deep fascia that underlies the subcutaneous fat in the limbs and elsewhere, surrounds the neck like a collar (Fig. 6.1). It splits around sternocleidomastoid and trapezius with a layer adherent to the superficial and deep surfaces of each of them. Posteriorly it meets the ligamentum nuchae, from which the cervical part of trapezius arises. The fascia is attached to the hyoid bone, hence the chin and Adam&rsquo;s apple of man in profile; there is no dewlap as in cattle. On the base of the skull, the attachments of trapezius and sternocleidomastoid extend from the external occipital protuberance in a curve along the superior nuchal line to the tip of the mastoid process. The investing layer enclosing both muscles is attached to the skull over the whole extent of this line; in the front of the neck it is attached to the lower border of the mandible, from chin to angle on each side.</p><p>Between the angle of the mandible and the tip of the mastoid process the investing layer splits to form a capsule for the parotid gland. The superficial part of the capsule, attached above to the zygomatic arch, is thick and forms the parotid fascia. The deep part extending from the styloid process to the angle of the mandible is thickened as the stylomandibular ligament. A further thickening has been described between the angle of the mandible and the anterior border of sternocleidomastoid, sometimes called the mandibulostylohyoid ligament because it can be traced from the angle to the lower end of the stylohyoid ligament.</p><p>It is attached to the spine of the scapula and the lateral flat part of the clavicle with the trapezius muscle, and to the clavicle and sternum with the sternocleidomastoid. In the intervals between these muscles, it is attached to both clavicles and to the jugular notch by two layers into which it splits a short distance above them. The layers are attached to the anterior and posterior borders of the jugular notch, enclosing between them the suprasternal space in which the anterior jugular veins angle laterally to pass behind the sternocleidomastoids; the veins are often joined in the space by an anastomotic arch. Of the two layers that adhere to the middle third of the clavicle (between sternocleidomastoid and trapezius) the deeper splits around the inferior belly of the omohyoid, forming a fascial sling.</p><p>This is a firm, tough membrane that lies in front of the prevertebral muscles (Fig. 6.1). It extends from the base of the skull in front of the longus capitis and rectus capitis lateralis downwards to the lower limit of the longus colli muscle (body of T3 vertebra). It extends sideways across the scalenus anterior, scalenus medius and levator scapulae muscles (Fig. 6.6), getting thinner further out and finally fading out of existence well under cover of the anterior border of trapezius. In the posterior triangle of the neck it covers the muscles that floor the triangle, and, since it crosses in front of the anterior tubercles of the cervical transverse processes, all the cervical nerve roots (and thus the cervical plexus and trunks of the brachial plexus) lie deep to it. The lymph nodes of the posterior triangle and the accessory nerve lie superficial to it. It has also the third part of the subclavian artery (not the vein) deep to it; it becomes prolonged over the artery below the clavicle as the axillary sheath. It does not invest the subclavian or axillary vein; these lie in loose areolar tissue anterior to it, free to dilate during times of increased venous return from the upper limb. The fascia is pierced by the four cutaneous branches of the cervical plexus (great auricular, lesser occipital, transverse cervical and supraclavicular nerves). The purpose of the prevertebral fascia is to provide a fixed basis on which the pharynx, oesophagus and carotid sheaths can glide during neck movements and swallowing, undisturbed by any movements of the prevertebral muscles.</p><h3 id=pretracheal-fascia>Pretracheal Fascia
<a class=anchor href=#pretracheal-fascia>#</a></h3><p>Like the other fasciae of the neck, this (Fig. 6.1) forms a layer between sliding surfaces. It lies deep to the infrahyoid strap muscles (sternothyroid, sternohyoid and omohyoid) so that its upward attachment is limited by the respective attachments of those muscles, namely, the hyoid bone at the midline and the oblique line of the thyroid cartilage more laterally. It splits to enclose the thyroid gland, to which it is not adherent except between the isthmus and second, third and fourth rings of the trachea. The thymus lies behind it, and aberrant inferior parathyroid glands (developed from the same branchial pouch as the thymus) migrate down behind it. It is pierced by the thyroid vessels. Laterally, it fuses with the front of the carotid sheath on the deep surface of the sternocleidomastoid and inferiorly it passes behind the brachiocephalic veins to blend with the adventitia of the arch of the aorta and the fibrous pericardium. Comparable to the prevertebral fascia, the pretracheal fascia provides a slippery surface for up and down gliding of the trachea during swallowing and neck movements.</p><h3 id=carotid-sheath>Carotid Sheath
<a class=anchor href=#carotid-sheath>#</a></h3><p>This is not a fascia in the sense of a demonstrable membranous layer, but consists of a feltwork of areolar tissue that surrounds the carotid arteries (common and internal), internal jugular vein and the vagus nerve (Fig. 6.1). It is thin where it overlies the internal jugular vein; this is to be expected, for the vein must be free to dilate during increased blood flow. The sheath is attached to the base of the skull at the margins of the carotid canal, and is continued downwards along the vessels to the aortic arch. In front the lower part of the sheath is firmly attached to the deep surface of the sternocleidomastoid and along this line the pretracheal fascia blends with it. Behind the carotid sheath there is a minimum of loose areolar tissue between it and the prevertebral fascia - not enough to limit the spread of infection. In this tenuous tissue the cervical sympathetic trunk lies, attached to the front of the prevertebral fascia (Fig. 6.6). It is described further on pages 434 and 462.</p><h2 id=tissue-spaces-of-the-neck>Tissue Spaces of the Neck
<a class=anchor href=#tissue-spaces-of-the-neck>#</a></h2><p>The so-called tissue spaces of the neck are potential spaces with loose connective tissue which can become expanded when invaded by infection. Since the advent of antibiotics they have become less significant than in the past, but those that remain of most importance clinically are the prevertebral, retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal and submandibular spaces.</p><p>Behind the prevertebral fascia is the closed prevertebral space from which the only escape can be made by a perforation in the fascia. For example, an abscess from a cervical vertebra can lift the prevertebral fascia as far as the third thoracic body, but can extend no lower unless the fascia gives way. Immediately in front of the prevertebral fascia is a space that extends from the base of the skull to the diaphragm (Fig. 4.11, p. 255). Its upper part is the retropharyngeal space; and below this the space extends behind the oesophagus through the superior into the posterior mediastinum. In the neck the retropharyngeal space lies between the prevertebral fascia and the buccopharyngeal fascia on the outer surface of the pharynx (p. 486). Infection in this space (e.g. in infants from infected lymph nodes that lie here) may pass behind the carotid sheath into the posterior triangle. Pathological walling off usually prevents downward spread into the mediastinum, although there is no anatomical barrier to such spread. The space may be said to continue laterally into a parapharyngeal space at the side of the pharynx; this space is bounded laterally by the pterygoid muscles and the parotid sheath. In the upper part of the neck there is further continuation anteriorly into the submandibular space which extends above the investing layer of fascia between the hyoid bone and the mandible to the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth. It contains the mylohyoid muscle with the sublingual gland above it and the submandibular gland hooking round its posterior border. Infection here produces the cellulitis known as Ludwig&rsquo;s angina (p. 436).</p><p>To assist the description of the topographical anatomy of the neck, each side is divided into anterior and posterior triangles by the obliquely placed sternocleidomastoid muscle (Figs 6.2 and 6.4). The posterior triangle lies between the posterior border of sternocleidomastoid, the anterior border of trapezius and the clavicle, and the anterior triangle between the anterior border of sternocleidomastoid, the lower border of the mandible and the midline. The anterior triangle can be subdivided into submental, digastric, carotid and muscular triangles. None of these has any meaning except to divide a complicated area into small packages which many find a helpful aid to memory (see p. 439).</p><h2 id=sternocleidomastoid>Sternocleidomastoid
<a class=anchor href=#sternocleidomastoid>#</a></h2><p>This prominent neck landmark (Figs 6.2 and 6.4) is still commonly known by its older name of sternomastoid. The two heads of origin below spring from the manubrium and clavicle respectively; that from the manubrium is a rounded tendon, that from the clavicle a thick fleshy mass. A triangular interval exists between the two above the sternoclavicular joint, and the lower end of the internal jugular vein lies here, where it can be entered by needle or catheter. The manubrial tendon is attached to the front of the bone below the jugular notch. From this tendon a broad fleshy belly develops which passes upwards to be inserted into a curved line extending from the tip of the mastoid process to the superior nuchal line of the occipital bone. Thus one could speak of two parts of the muscle here - sternomastoid and sterno-occipitalis, though the two parts are intimately blended. The posterior fibres of the clavicular head are inserted into the superior nuchal line medial to and in line with the sterno-occipitalis fibres. This part of the muscle could be called cleido-occipitalis, and it forms with the other two a continuous sheet on the surface of the muscle. The remaining fibres (cleidomastoid) lie deep to these. Between this part of the muscle and the rest the accessory nerve enters the muscle and runs down within it to emerge into the posterior triangle about halfway down the posterior border of the muscle.</p><p>Sternocleidomastoid is enclosed within a sheath of the investing layer of deep cervical fascia, which splits to surround it (Fig. 6.1). The attachment more anteriorly of this fascia to the hyoid bone draws the muscle forward in a gentle convexity that is very noticeable when the head is rotated.</p><p>The muscle separates the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck. When the triangles have been studied there remains a wide strip of territory deep to the muscle. In general one can say that deep to the upper half of it lies the cervical plexus (p. 426), and deep to its lower part lies the common carotid artery and carotid sheath (p. 434) overlying scalenus anterior.</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> By the spinal part of the accessory nerve, C1-6 but mostly C2 and 3, from a branch which leaves it proximal to its point of entry into the muscle. The anterior horn cells of the segments concerned are innervated by the cerebral cortex of their own side (but those supplying trapezius receive the usual contralateral innervation). The reason is that when, for example, the left upper limb muscles (including trapezius) are being used and the head is turned to that side to see what is going on, it is the right sternocleidomastoid that is turning the head to the left; the same (right) cortex controls all the muscles. Branches from the cervical plexus (C2, 3) also enter the muscle but these are only proprioceptive.</p><p><strong>Action.</strong> Contraction of one muscle produces the wry neck position with the ear approaching the tip of the shoulder and the chin rotating to the opposite side. (Splenius capitis of the opposite side produces the same result.) If the opposite abducting muscles contract (such as scalenus medius and semispinalis cervicis) the neck is held vertical and simple rotation of the head results. Sternocleidomastoid is the principal rotator of the lateral atlantoaxial joint, and in turning the face towards the opposite side the muscle can easily be seen and felt.</p><p>The action of both muscles contracting simultaneously is more complex. The result depends in part on the previous position of the head, and above all upon what other muscles are contracting at the same time. The posterior fibres pass up behind the lateral atlanto-occipital joints, which they therefore extend. The most anterior fibres lie just in front of these joints, so this part of the muscle flexes the skull on the atlas. However, the chief purpose of the muscle, starting with the head in the normal position (face vertical, gaze horizontal) is to protract the head - to move the face forwards while keeping it vertical and maintaining a horizontal gaze, as in peering over someone&rsquo;s shoulder in a crowd. Note that this action is a combination of flexion of the cervical spine and extension of the atlanto-occipital joints simultaneously. It cannot be overemphasized that the sternocleidomastoids seldom contract alone, and their action must always be considered in association with other groups. They are essentially antagonists to the extensor muscles behind the vertebrae, but since they are not attached to the vertebral column and only to the movable head, they must exert a powerful action to the atlanto-occipital joints in addition to flexing the cervical spine.</p><p><strong>Test.</strong> The face is turned to the opposite side against resistance and the muscle palpated.</p><h2 id=posterior-triangle>Posterior Triangle
<a class=anchor href=#posterior-triangle>#</a></h2><p>This is an area enclosed between the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. Its apex lies high up at the back of the skull on the superior nuchal line. Its base is in front at the root of the neck and consists of the part of the clavicle lying between the two muscles, generally the middle third of the bone. The triangle is a spiral and therefore illustrations tend to distort its true appearance. Its roof is formed by the investing layer of deep cervical fascia described above. Its floor consists of the prevertebral fascia (Figs 6.2 and 6.6). Beneath this fascia may be seen, from above downwards, portions of the following muscles: splenius, levator scapulae, scalenus posterior, scalenus medius, and scalenus anterior, while in the lateral angle just beyond the border of the first rib, part of the first digitation of serratus anterior is visible, especially if the shoulder be depressed. At the very apex of the triangle, between sternocleidomastoid and trapezius, the upper border of splenius (p. 546) is often low enough to expose a little of semispinalis capitis (p. 544). The prevertebral fascia plasters down upon the lower parts of the scalenes and levator scapulae the subclavian artery, the three trunks of the brachial plexus and the loops of the cervical plexus. In operations on the posterior triangle all these structures are safe provided the prevertebral fascia is left intact.</p><h3 id=contents>Contents
<a class=anchor href=#contents>#</a></h3><p>At the very apex of the triangle the occipital artery and greater occipital nerve emerge to pass up on to the scalp (p. 453).</p><p>Lying between the roof and floor are the lymph nodes of the posterior triangle. Two or three occipital nodes lie in the subcutaneous tissue at the apex; they become enlarged in scalp infections and rubella. The nodes are most numerous above the clavicle, constituting the supraclavicular nodes; they are really outlying members of the lower group of deep cervical nodes (p. 522).</p><p>The accessory nerve emerges from sternocleidomastoid about halfway down its posterior border, and passes almost vertically downwards overlying levator scapulae and embedded within the fascia of the roof of the triangle, to disappear beneath the anterior border of trapezius 5 cm above the clavicle (Fig. 6.2). It is thus particularly liable to injury in operations involving the removal of lymph nodes. The surface marking of the nerve can be demonstrated by first palpating the transverse process of the atlas (in front of the mastoid process). From this point a line drawn to the anterior border of trapezius 5 cm above the clavicle indicates the course of the nerve through sternocleidomastoid and the triangle.</p><p>The cutaneous branches of the cervical plexus pierce the investing fascia at the posterior border of sternocleidomastoid. The cervical branches to trapezius pass across the fascial floor of the triangle. They must not be confused with the accessory nerve which emerges from within the substance of sternocleidomastoid; the plexus branches are behind the muscle.</p><p>The inferior belly of omohyoid crosses the lower medial part of the triangle and is kept in place by its sling of investing fascia. A thin muscle belly must not be confused with the suprascapular nerve or vessels.</p><p>The transverse cervical and suprascapular vessels are in the lower part of the triangle just above the clavicle. The third part of the subclavian artery (p. 444) is also classified among the contents of the triangle but is very low down. Its pulsation can be felt by pressing downwards behind the clavicle at the lateral border of sternocleidomastoid. The subclavian vein is lower still and is not included in the triangle, but the external jugular vein slips into the anterior corner of the triangle on its way to the subclavian.</p><p>In the floor of the posterior triangle, levator scapulae, described with the muscles of the pectoral girdle (p. 60), is usually split longitudinally into two ribbons of muscle. The accessory nerve lies upon it, separated by the prevertebral fascia. The transverse cervical artery divides at its anterior border, the ascending branch running up to the muscle, the descending branch running down deep to it, in company with the dorsal scapular nerve (see p. 445).</p><p>Scalenus posterior, scalenus medius and scalenus anterior are described with the root of the neck (p. 442).</p><h2 id=cervical-plexus>Cervical Plexus
<a class=anchor href=#cervical-plexus>#</a></h2><p>The cervical plexus (Fig. 6.3) is formed by simple loops between the anterior rami of the upper four cervical nerves, after each has received a grey ramus from the superior cervical ganglion. It lies in series with the brachial plexus, on the scalenus medius, plastered down beneath the prevertebral fascia. It is covered by the upper part of sternocleidomastoid, and does not lie actually in the posterior triangle.</p><p><strong>Muscular branches.</strong> Muscular branches are given off segmentally to the prevertebral muscles (longus capitis, longus colli and the scalenes). Other muscular branches are:</p><ol><li>A loop from C1 to the hypoglossal nerve, by which the fibres are carried to its meningeal branch and the superior root of the ansa cervicalis, the former descendens hypoglossi (infrahyoid muscles) and the nerves to thyrohyoid and geniohyoid.</li><li>Branches from C2 and 3 to sternocleidomastoid, and from C3 and 4 to trapezius (Fig. 6.2). These fibres are proprioceptive, all the motor fibres to the muscles being in the accessory nerve but there is evidence that occasionally the whole of trapezius is not paralysed when the accessory nerve is damaged, in which case at least some of the cervical fibres are presumably motor.</li><li>The inferior root of the ansa cervicalis (formerly called descendens cervicalis) is formed by union of a branch each from C2 and C3. The nerve spirals around the lateral side of the internal jugular vein and descends to join the superior root (C1) at the ansa (p. 434).</li><li>The phrenic nerve is formed mainly from C4 with unimportant contributions from C3 and C5 and runs down vertically over the obliquity of the scalenus anterior muscle, passing from lateral to medial borders, beneath the prevertebral fascia, lateral to the ascending cervical branch of the inferior thyroid artery. It passes behind the subclavian vein into the mediastinum (p. 261). It may be joined below the vein by a branch (the accessory phrenic nerve) from the nerve to subclavius. It is not uncommon for the phrenic nerve to descend in front of the subclavian vein. Rarely it may penetrate the vein. This is understood by recalling that the vein forms by a coalescence of a rich venous plexus in the embryo. The phrenic nerve is one of the most important in the body, being the sole motor supply to its own half of the diaphragm (p. 250), and it also has an extensive afferent distribution, not only to the diaphragm but to the pericardium, pleura and peritoneum (pp. 265, 281 and 318).</li></ol><p><strong>Cutaneous branches.</strong> The four cutaneous branches of the cervical plexus emerge from the posterior border of sternocleidomastoid about halfway down its length, and radiate out to supply the skin of the neck and adjacent areas.</p><p>The lesser occipital nerve (C2) runs up along the posterior border of sternocleidomastoid to supply the posterior part of the neck up to the superior nuchal line (i.e. over the upper part of sternocleidomastoid), and behind the auricle. It may overlap to the tip of the auricle.</p><p>The great auricular nerve (C2, 3, mostly 2) is much more important. A large trunk passing vertically upwards over sternocleidomastoid, it is distributed to an area of skin on the face over the angle of the mandible and the parotid gland and to the parotid fascia as well as to the auricle. It supplies the skin of the auricle over the whole of its cranial surface and on the lower part of its lateral surface below the external acoustic meatus, and skin over the mastoid region. Branches passing deep to the parotid gland supply the deep layer of the parotid fascia. The nerve has a curious propensity to become palpably and visibly thickened in tuberculoid leprosy.</p><p>The transverse cervical nerve (formerly the anterior cutaneous nerve of the neck) (C2, 3) emerges as a single trunk behind the posterior border of sternocleidomastoid, and quickly breaks up into a number of slender twigs that innervate the skin in the midline of the neck from chin to sternum. Interruption of the main trunk thus produces a very elongated area of anaesthesia. The nerve is some distance from the transverse cervical artery, which is just above the clavicle.</p><p>The supraclavicular nerve (C3, 4, but mostly 4) emerges in common with the other three at the posterior border of sternomastoid and soon divides into three branches or groups of branches. They are distributed in three main groups. The medial group supply the skin as far down as the sternal angle and the sternoclavicular joint. The intermediate group proper pass anterior to (occasionally through) the clavicle and supply skin as far down as the anterior axial line. The lateral group pass not only across the acromion to the skin halfway down the deltoid muscle, but also over the posterior aspect of the shoulder to supply skin as far down as the spine of the scapula (posterior axial line: Fig. 1.11, p. 20).</p><p>In addition to the cutaneous branches of the cervical plexus described above, which supply the anterior and lateral skin of the neck, the greater occipital and third occipital nerves from posterior rami of C2 and C3 respectively (p. 454) provide sensory fibres for the back of the neck (Fig. 6.13). The first cervical nerve does not supply any skin. C2 supplies most of the posterior part of the neck, extending into the occipital region of the scalp and forwards to the auricle and the face over the angle of the mandible, C3 supplies the cylindrical part of the neck, C4 extends over the clavicular region across the top of the shoulder and down to the scapular spine (an area that supports the weight of a cape). There is much overlap between the boundary lines shown in the figure.</p><h2 id=anterior-triangle>Anterior Triangle
<a class=anchor href=#anterior-triangle>#</a></h2><p>As mentioned on page 424, the traditional subdivision of this area into several triangles is only useful in breaking it into smaller packages, and here they will only be referred to at the end of this section (p. 439) to provide localized summaries that can be useful aids to memory for practical and oral examinations, and for surgeons operating in these regions. The general area bounded by the lower border of the mandible and lying between the two sternocleidomastoid muscles is dealt with as a whole. It contains the viscera of the neck.</p><p>Beneath the investing layer of deep cervical fascia are two groups of longitudinal muscles that extend from the mandible to the sternum, and which are supplied segmentally by the anterior rami of the upper three cervical nerves. The hyoid bone, situated at the level of C3 vertebra, is an important landmark at the front and side of the neck, and provides attachments for (among others) the two groups of four muscles each (Fig. 8.15, p. 665). The suprahyoid muscles above the bone comprise digastric, stylohyoid, mylohyoid and geniohyoid; the mylohyoids of each side unite to form the floor of the mouth, with the digastrics and stylohyoids superficial and geniohyoids deep to them. The infrahyoid group below the bone are sternohyoid and omohyoid, lying side by side in the same plane, and more deeply a wider sheet of muscle attached to the thyroid cartilage and forming thyrohyoid and sternothyroid. The last four are commonly called the strap muscles from their flat shape. All these muscles are in the same plane of the body wall musculature as rectus abdominis. One should picture the rectus sheet as extending from chin to pubic symphysis, supplied segmentally from C1 to T12 spinal nerves, but interrupted by the intervention of the thoracic cage. Remnants of the longitudinal strip sometimes lie over pectoralis major, forming rectus sternalis (Fig. 2.2, p. 55).</p><h3 id=digastric>Digastric
<a class=anchor href=#digastric>#</a></h3><p>This arises as the posterior belly, from the digastric notch on the medial surface of the mastoid process. The triangular fleshy belly tapers down to the intermediate tendon, which is held beneath a fibrous sling attached to the lesser horn of the hyoid bone. The tendon is lubricated by a synovial sheath within the fibrous sling. The bifurcated tendon of insertion of stylohyoid which embraces the tendon plays no part in holding it down. The anterior belly lies on the inferior surface of mylohyoid, and connects the intermediate tendon to the digastric fossa on the inner surface of the mandible.</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> The posterior belly is supplied by the facial nerve, by a branch arising between the stylomastoid foramen and the parotid gland, and the anterior belly by the nerve to mylohyoid.</p><p><strong>Action.</strong> To depress and retract the chin, and to assist the lateral pterygoid in opening the mouth.</p><h3 id=stylohyoid>Stylohyoid
<a class=anchor href=#stylohyoid>#</a></h3><p>This arises from the back of the styloid process, high up near the base of the skull, and slopes down along the upper border of digastric. Its lower end divides to embrace the digastric tendon and is inserted by two slips into the base of the greater horn of the hyoid bone.</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> By the facial nerve, by a branch usually arising with that to the posterior belly of digastric.</p><p><strong>Action.</strong> To retract and elevate the hyoid bone when swallowing.</p><h3 id=mylohyoid>Mylohyoid
<a class=anchor href=#mylohyoid>#</a></h3><p>The muscles of each side unite to make a thin sheet forming the diaphragm of the floor of the mouth (Fig. 6.5). Each rises from the whole length of the mylohyoid line of its own side of the mandible as far back as the posterior surface of the third molar tooth. The two muscles slope downwards towards each other, and the posterior quarter of each is inserted into the anterior surface of the body of the hyoid bone. In front of this the anterior three-quarters of each interdigitate in a midline raphe which extends from the chin to the hyoid bone.</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> By its own nerve, a branch of the inferior alveolar (from the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve), which arises just before the parent nerve enters the mandibular foramen.</p><p><strong>Action.</strong> It forms a mobile but stable floor of the mouth and supports the weight and thrust of the tongue. The two muscles together form a gutter; contraction makes the gutter more shallow, thus elevating the tongue and the hyoid bone as when swallowing or protruding the tongue (see p. 483).</p><h3 id=geniohyoid>Geniohyoid
<a class=anchor href=#geniohyoid>#</a></h3><p>This slender flat ribbon of muscle extends from the inferior mental spine (genial tubercle) of the mandible to the upper border of the body of the hyoid bone. The two muscles lie side by side between the mylohyoids and the base of the tongue (genioglossus), in the floor of the mouth (p. 484).</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> By a branch from the hypoglossal nerve, but it consists of fibres from C1 nerve and not from the hypoglossal nucleus; it is not seen superficially in the neck because the mylohyoids have migrated below it.</p><p><strong>Action.</strong> To protract and elevate the hyoid bone in swallowing, or if the hyoid is fixed, to depress the mandible.</p><h3 id=sternohyoid>Sternohyoid
<a class=anchor href=#sternohyoid>#</a></h3><p>This flat strap of muscle extends from the lower border of the hyoid bone to the back of the sternoclavicular joint and adjoining parts of manubrium and clavicle. The two muscles lie edge to edge at the hyoid bone, but diverge from each other below; the Adam&rsquo;s apple projects through the space between them (Fig. 6.4).</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> By a branch from the ansa cervicalis which enters the lower end of the muscle and runs up in its substance to supply it segmentally (C1, 2, 3 from above down). Tendinous intersections, occasionally present, indicate the segmental origin of the muscle from paravertebral myotomes (compare with rectus abdominis but see p. 298).</p><h3 id=omohyoid>Omohyoid
<a class=anchor href=#omohyoid>#</a></h3><p>This flat strap of muscle lies edge to edge with sternohyoid at its attachment to the lateral part of the inferior border of the hyoid bone (Fig. 6.4). As it descends it diverges somewhat from the sternohyoid and, passing beneath sternocleidomastoid, it comes to lie over the carotid sheath. Where it lies over the internal jugular vein, the muscle fibres are replaced by a flat tendon that slides readily on this structure; the tendon is a useful guide at operation to the underlying vein. A change of direction now occurs, and the inferior belly passes almost horizontally just above the level of the clavicle to pass back to its attachment to the transverse scapular ligament and a little of the upper border of the scapula. The intermediate tendon and supraclavicular portion of the muscle are bound down to the clavicle in a fascial sling derived from the deep layer of the investing layer of deep cervical fascia (Fig. 2.3, p. 56). The development of the muscle is interesting. At first attached in the fetus to the medial end of the clavicle it is a longitudinal strip of muscle like the rest of the infrahyoid musculature. However, it migrates along the clavicle and finally reaches its adult attachment to the scapula. The process of migration may be arrested at any point.</p><h3 id=thyrohyoid>Thyrohyoid
<a class=anchor href=#thyrohyoid>#</a></h3><p>This is a broader and shorter muscle that lies under cover of the upper ends of sternohyoid and omohyoid. It arises beneath these two muscles from the greater horn of the hyoid bone, and is inserted into the oblique line of the thyroid cartilage, end to end with sternothyroid.</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> By a branch of the hypoglossal nerve, but the fibres are all hitchhiking from C1 like the nerve to geniohyoid.</p><h3 id=sternothyroid>Sternothyroid
<a class=anchor href=#sternothyroid>#</a></h3><p>Broader than sternohyoid and lying deep to it (Fig. 6.4), this muscle is attached lower down than sternohyoid on the posterior surface of the manubrium; so low, in fact, that it is below the sternoclavicular joint and has no attachment to the clavicle. It extends laterally from the manubrium to the first costal cartilage. Its upper attachment is to the oblique line of the thyroid cartilage.</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> By the ansa cervicalis (C2, 3).</p><p><strong>Action of Infrahyoid Muscles.</strong> They are all depressors of the larynx. Sternothyroid acts directly on the thyroid cartilage, the others act indirectly via the hyoid bone. Depression of the larynx increases the volume of the resonating chambers during phonation and thus affects the quality of the voice. Probably a much more significant role of the infrahyoid muscles is to oppose the elevators of the larynx (mylohyoid, palatopharyngeus, stylopharyngeus, salpingopharyngeus, inferior constrictor), paying out rope during contraction of the elevators; descent of the larynx after elevation is due at least partly to elastic recoil of the trachea. The infrahyoid muscles prevent ascent of the hyoid bone when the digastric is in action (p. 525). A contracting thyrohyoid approximates the thyroid cartilage and hyoid bone. Which moves the more depends on what other muscles are in action at the time. When the head is rotated to one side, the opposite omohyoid is straightened, and can exert a more direct downward pull on the hyoid bone (Fig. 6.58, p. 524).</p><h2 id=thyroid-gland>Thyroid Gland
<a class=anchor href=#thyroid-gland>#</a></h2><p>The thyroid gland consists of two symmetrical lobes united in front of the second, third and fourth tracheal rings by an isthmus of gland tissue (Fig. 6.4). Apart from its own thin capsule it is enclosed by an envelope of pretracheal fascia.</p><p>Each lateral lobe is pear-shaped with a narrow upper pole and a broader lower pole, and appears approximately triangular on cross-section with lateral, medial and posterior surfaces.</p><p>The lateral (superficial) surface is under cover of sternothyroid and sternohyoid; the upper pole is tucked.</p><p>The medial surface lies against the lateral side of the larynx and upper trachea, the lower pole extending along the side of the trachea as low as the sixth tracheal ring, with the lower pharynx and upper oesophagus immediately behind. The cricothyroid muscles of the larynx and the inferior constrictor of the pharynx are medial muscular relations of this surface, with the external and recurrent laryngeal nerves approaching it from above and below respectively (see below).</p><p>The posterior surface is in contact with the carotid sheath, i.e. the part containing the common carotid artery; if enlarged, the lobe may extend across the more laterally placed internal jugular vein. The parathyroid glands usually lie in contact with this surface, between it and the fascial sheath. The inferior thyroid artery arches behind the lower pole (at the level of C6 vertebra), and on the left the thoracic duct also describes a similar arch but at a lower level (C7 vertebra).</p><p>Of all the structures related to the thyroid lobes, the recurrent laryngeal nerve (p. 464) must take pride of place in view of its importance in thyroid surgery. Approaching the medial surface of the gland from below, and at this level usually in front of the groove between the trachea and oesophagus, the left nerve is more likely to lie behind the inferior thyroid artery than in front of it (see below), while on the right there is an equal chance of it lying in front of or behind the artery; but either may pass between branches of the artery. A minute artery is usually visible on the surface of the nerve and helps to identify it. The nerve is always behind the pretracheal fascia (including the thickening of it attached to the cricoid cartilage and sometimes called the suspensory ligament of Berry), and behind the cricothyroid joint, whence it passes upwards under cover of the inferior constrictor. At the level of the upper border of the isthmus the nerve often divides into two. If so, the anterior (larger) branch is the motor branch to laryngeal muscles, and the posterior branch is sensory only. The occasional non-recurrent right laryngeal nerve must be remembered (p. 41).</p><p>The isthmus joins the anterior surfaces of the lobes, towards their lower poles. The posterior surface of the isthmus is firmly adherent to the second, third and fourth rings of the trachea, and the pretracheal fascia is here fixed between them. This fixation and the investment of the whole gland by pretracheal fascia are responsible for the gland moving up and down with the larynx during swallowing.</p><p>A anastomosis between the two superior thyroid arteries runs across the upper border of the isthmus, and tributaries of the inferior thyroid veins emerge from its lower border. A small portion of gland substance often projects upwards from the isthmus, generally to the left of the midline, as the pyramidal lobe and represents a development of glandular tissue from the caudal end of the thyroglossal duct (p. 39). It is attached to the inferior border of the hyoid bone by fibrous tissue; muscle fibres sometimes present in it are named levator glandulae thyroideae and are innervated by a branch of the external laryngeal nerve.</p><p>Separate masses of thyroid tissue (accessory thyroid glands) are not uncommonly found near the hyoid bone, in the tongue, in the superior mediastinum, or beneath the sternocleidomastoid muscle.</p><h3 id=blood-supply>Blood Supply
<a class=anchor href=#blood-supply>#</a></h3><p>The superior thyroid artery, the first branch from the anterior aspect of the external carotid (p. 437), after giving off its sternocleidomastoid and superior laryngeal branches, pierces the pretracheal fascia as a single vessel to reach the summit of the upper pole. The external laryngeal nerve is immediately behind the artery as the vessel approaches the pole; in thyroidectomies the artery is ligated right at the pole, not some distance from it, to avoid damage to the nerve. The artery divides on the gland into an anterior branch that runs down to the isthmus and a posterior branch that runs down the back of the lobe and anastomoses with an ascending branch of the inferior thyroid artery from the lower pole. A separate branch from the left artery may supply the pyramidal lobe.</p><p>The inferior thyroid artery, from the thyrocervical trunk (p. 444), arches upwards and medially behind the lower pole and divides outside the pretracheal fascia into four or five branches that pierce the fascia separately to reach the lower pole of the gland. The suspensory ligament always contains small branches. The recurrent laryngeal nerve has a variable relationship to the artery (see above) but always lies behind the pretracheal fascia, and if this structure remains intact during thyroidectomy the nerve will not have been divided. It is close behind the fascia, however, and may be bruised or caught in a ligature; hence the preference of some, but not all, surgeons of ligating the inferior thyroid artery well lateral to the gland before it begins to divide into its terminal branches. (Note that the inferior thyroid artery gives off oesophageal and inferior laryngeal branches before its terminal distribution into the thyroid gland.)</p><p>The thyroidea ima artery enters the lower part of the isthmus in 3% of individuals. It springs from the brachiocephalic trunk, right common carotid artery or direct from the arch of the aorta, and represents a persistent embryonic vessel that usually disappears.</p><p>The venous return from the upper pole follows the superior thyroid artery. The superior thyroid vein enters either the internal jugular or facial vein in about equal proportions. The middle thyroid vein, short and wide, is usually present. It passes from the middle of the lobe, directly into the internal jugular vein. From the isthmus and lower poles the inferior thyroid veins form a plexus that lies in the pretracheal fascia, in front of the cervical part of the trachea. The plexus drains into the brachiocephalic veins, most of it into the left one.</p><p>The lymphatics follow the arteries. From the upper pole they enter the anterosuperior group of deep cervical lymph nodes. From the lower pole they pass with the inferior thyroid artery back to its point of origin from the subclavian behind the carotid sheath into the posteroinferior group. A few pass downwards into pretracheal nodes, following the course of the thyroidea ima artery.</p><p>The bulk of the sympathetic (vasoconstrictor) supply is derived from the middle cervical ganglion and enters the gland on the inferior thyroid artery; some fibres from the superior cervical ganglion travel with the superior thyroid artery. Vagus nerve filaments are traceable to the gland; their purpose is unknown.</p><h3 id=structure>Structure
<a class=anchor href=#structure>#</a></h3><p>The thyroid consists essentially of a mass of more or less rounded follicles (sometimes called vesicles) full of colloid, the iodine-containing product of the single layer of epithelial (follicular) cells that form the walls of the follicles. The thyroid is thus unique in being the only endocrine gland to store its secretion outside the cells. The colloid is iodinated when in the follicle, not in the cells, and reabsorbed by the cells before being discharged into blood capillaries. Most histological sections give little idea of the great vascularity of the gland, which, in proportion to its size, has one of the highest blood flows of any organ. The main hormonal products are thyroxine (T₄) and triiodothyronine (T₃). Less than 2% of the epithelial cells are the C or parafollicular cells which secrete calcitonin. Difficult to see histologically, they are easy to identify with the electron microscope because of their content of secretory granules.

<a class=anchor href=#development>#</a></h3><p>The gland develops as a proliferation of cells from the caudal end of the thyroglossal duct (p. 39). The parafollicular calcitonin-producing cells are now known to come from the ultimobranchial body (fifth pharyngeal pouch), but no other part of the gland is derived from pharyngeal pouches.</p><h3 id=surgical-approach>Surgical Approach
<a class=anchor href=#surgical-approach>#</a></h3><p>For partial thyroidectomy through a transverse skin incision 2.5 cm above the jugular notch, the gap between the sternohyoids and sternothyroids is opened up to expose the trachea and the isthmus, and the muscles are retracted laterally, or if necessary divided near their upper ends (so preserving their nerve supplies from the ansa cervicalis) to display the lateral lobes. The vessels of each lobe are ligated and divided, and the required portion of each lobe removed (leaving the parathyroids intact). The position of the recurrent laryngeal nerves has been emphasized above. Enlarged lobes may stretch the strap muscles and it is important to define properly the plane deep to sternothyroid and sternohyoid, and not to damage the thin-walled internal jugular vein.</p><h2 id=parathyroid-glands>Parathyroid Glands
<a class=anchor href=#parathyroid-glands>#</a></h2><p>The parathyroid glands normally lie behind the lateral lobe of the thyroid gland, and may be either within or outside the thyroid&rsquo;s capsule of pretracheal fascia. There are usually four glands (in 90% of subjects), two on each side, with a total weight of not more than 200 mg.</p><p>The superior gland is the more constant in position; it is usually on the back of the thyroid lobe, level with the first tracheal ring and above the inferior thyroid artery. The inferior gland is the more variable in position (see Development, below), usually behind the lower pole, below the inferior thyroid artery and lateral to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The glands are not necessarily on the same level on each side. They are brownish-yellow in colour, which should help to distinguish them from thyroid tissue and fat. They are sometimes (especially the inferior gland) embedded within the thyroid lobe rather than being behind it. If they are difficult to find, follow the branches of the inferior thyroid artery upwards and downwards; a small branch enters each gland - a further distinguishing feature from a globule of fat.</p><h3 id=blood-supply-1>Blood Supply
<a class=anchor href=#blood-supply-1>#</a></h3><p>Both upper and lower parathyroids are usually supplied by the inferior thyroid artery, with minute veins joining thyroid vessels.</p><h3 id=lymph-drainage>Lymph Drainage

<a class=anchor href=#structure-1>#</a></h3><p>In histological section the gland is homogeneous and very vascular, two points that aid identification. The gland is a mass of small closely-packed chief or principal cells which secrete the parathyroid hormone (PTH). The mass of cells bears a superficial resemblance to lymphoid tissue, but the number of blood capillaries in the gland provides a clear distinction. Scattered among the chief cells are small groups of slightly larger oxyphil cells, probably derived from the chief cells but of unknown function.</p><h3 id=development-1>Development
<a class=anchor href=#development-1>#</a></h3><p>The superior gland is often called parathyroid IV because it develops from the dorsal diverticulum of the fourth pharyngeal pouch; the inferior gland is parathyroid III, developed from the third pouch but displaced caudally by the descent of the thymus from the same pouch (p. 39). Thus the inferior gland, developed higher up, has farther to migrate than the superior and is more liable to end up in unusual positions. About 10% of inferior glands are found within the capsule of the thymus, and other aberrant glands may be found in the lower neck or the posterior or anterior mediastinum.</p><h3 id=surgical-approach-1>Surgical Approach
<a class=anchor href=#surgical-approach-1>#</a></h3><p>For parathyroidectomy the lobes of the thyroid gland are exposed as for thyroidectomy, and then retracted forwards and medially so that the posterior surfaces can be inspected for the parathyroids. If not obvious, branches of the inferior thyroid artery are followed and should lead to the glands. Exposure of the thymus may be necessary. If all four glands are to be removed, part of one of them is implanted into the brachioradialis muscle of an arm, where it should act as an endocrine graft; if later surgery on it is required (for recurrent hyperparathyroidism) it is easier to approach an arm than the neck.</p><h2 id=trachea>Trachea
<a class=anchor href=#trachea>#</a></h2><p>The trachea (Fig. 6.4) which begins at the level of C6 vertebra is in continuity with the larynx, being attached to the lower margin of the cricoid cartilage by the cricotracheal ligament. Its patency as an airway is maintained by the presence in its wall of a series of C-shaped hyaline cartilages (commonly called rings although they are never complete circles) joined together by a fibroelastic membrane. The gaps in the C-shaped rings lie posteriorly and this part of the trachea is closed by a sheet of visceral muscle, the trachealis. From the neck the trachea passes into the thorax, and so has cervical and thoracic parts. Of the total length of 10 cm (4 in), 5 cm are in the neck from the cricoid cartilage to the jugular notch, but during deep inspiration the total length may increase to 15 cm.</p><p>The cervical part lies in the midline of the neck, in contact with the front of the oesophagus. In the groove between trachea and oesophagus runs the recurrent laryngeal nerve. To the side of the trachea is the carotid sheath. The isthmus of the thyroid gland is adherent to the second, third and fourth tracheal rings and the lobes of the gland lie against the lateral side of the trachea as far down as the sixth ring. The inferior thyroid veins and anterior jugular venous arch lie in front, and also (if present) the thyroidea ima artery, the levator glandulae thyroideae and the upper end of a persistently large thymus. It is important to appreciate that, because of the shape of the lower cervical and upper thoracic parts of the vertebral column, the trachea passes not only downwards but backwards as well. Although just below the skin at cricoid level, it is 2 cm or more deep to the front of the jugular notch.</p><h3 id=tracheotomy-and-tracheostomy>Tracheotomy and Tracheostomy
<a class=anchor href=#tracheotomy-and-tracheostomy>#</a></h3><p>Tracheotomy implies making an incision in the trachea; tracheostomy involves removing a small part of the wall (making a stoma), but the strict distinction between these terms is often ignored. As an emergency procedure tracheotomy is nowadays usually replaced by laryngotomy (incising the cricothyroid ligament - p. 498). For elective tracheostomy, a transverse skin incision is made 2 cm below the cricoid cartilage. The interval between the two sternohyoid muscles is opened up and the slightly deeper sternothyroids are retracted laterally. The isthmus of the thyroid gland is divided and an opening made by removing part of the second and third tracheal rings so that a tracheostomy tube can be inserted. Haemorrhage from the isthmus and inferior thyroid veins should be easily avoided in an elective procedure.</p><h2 id=oesophagus>Oesophagus
<a class=anchor href=#oesophagus>#</a></h2><p>The oesophagus commences in continuity with the cricopharyngeus muscle at the level of the lower border of the cricoid cartilage (C6 vertebra). Its inner muscular coat breaks free from the lower border of this muscle to form a continuous circular coat. The outer longitudinal coat is attached to the midline ridge of the lamina of the cricoid cartilage and to the arytenoid cartilages. The fibres spiral down from this origin to the back of the oesophagus, whence the longitudinal coat is continuous (Fig. 6.30).</p><p>The cervical part of the oesophagus lies in front of C6 and 7 vertebrae and the prevertebral fascia and behind the trachea. It is overlapped by the lower poles of the thyroid gland, and the thoracic duct runs upwards behind its left border. The recurrent laryngeal nerves are on each side in the groove between trachea and oesophagus.</p><p>The rest of the oesophagus is described on page 277.</p><h2 id=carotid-sheath-1>Carotid Sheath
<a class=anchor href=#carotid-sheath-1>#</a></h2><p>The upper part is described on page 462. The lower part contains the common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, vagus nerve and the ansa cervicalis.</p><p>It is free posteriorly to slide over the prevertebral fascia, but is connected anteriorly by fibrous tissue to the fascia on the deep surface of sternocleidomastoid. Pus tracking laterally from around the pharynx thus passes behind, not in front of the sheath, to point in the posterior triangle. The sheath is very thin over the internal jugular vein, which is thus free to dilate enormously for increased blood flow. The dead space around the vein contains the inferior deep cervical lymph nodes in anterior and posterior groups, the latter extending behind sternocleidomastoid into the posterior triangle, forming a supraclavicular group (p. 426).</p><p>The lower part of the carotid sheath extends from the sternoclavicular joint vertically upwards to the level where the common carotid artery bifurcates into the external and internal carotids. This level is usually stated to be at the upper border of the thyroid cartilage (upper part of C4 vertebra), but is frequently higher, near the tip of the greater horn of the hyoid bone (C3 vertebra). The terminal portion of the artery is often dilated into the carotid sinus, continuous with that on the commencement of the internal carotid artery (p. 438).</p><p>The common carotid artery arises on the left side from the arch of the aorta, where it lies in front of the subclavian artery up to the sternoclavicular joint. Here the two arteries diverge. On the right the brachiocephalic trunk bifurcates behind the sternoclavicular joint into common carotid and subclavian arteries. The common carotid gives off no branches proximal to its bifurcation. It lies within the medial part of the carotid sheath, lateral to the larynx and trachea, with the internal jugular vein lateral to it and the vagus nerve deeply placed between the two vessels. The sympathetic trunk is behind the artery and outside the sheath, which is overlapped superficially by the infrahyoid muscles and sternocleidomastoid.</p><p>The carotid pulse can be felt by pressing backwards between the trachea and lower larynx medially and sternocleidomastoid laterally, i.e. pressing the artery against the tubercle of the transverse process of C6 vertebra. The surface marking of the common carotid artery is along a line from the sternoclavicular joint to the bifurcation near the greater horn of the hyoid bone. The vessel can be surgically exposed by retracting the lower part of sternocleidomastoid backwards and incising the carotid sheath.</p><p>The internal jugular vein and vagus nerve are described on pages 438 and 464.</p><h3 id=ansa-cervicalis>Ansa Cervicalis
<a class=anchor href=#ansa-cervicalis>#</a></h3><p>The ansa cervicalis lies on the front of the internal jugular vein and gives branches to the infrahyoid muscles. It is embedded within the anterior wall of the carotid sheath and classified as one of its contents. It is formed by union of superior and inferior roots. The superior root (descendens hypoglossi) is a branch of the hypoglossal nerve (see below) given off where the nerve loops just below the posterior belly of digastric, on the occipital, external carotid and lingual arteries. It runs down on the front of the internal jugular vein, and contains only C1 fibres, which have hitchhiked along the hypoglossal nerve.</p><p>The inferior root (descendens cervicalis) is formed by union of a branch each from C2 and C3 anterior rami in the cervical plexus. The single nerve so formed spirals from behind around the internal jugular vein and runs down to join the superior root at a variable level. Sometimes a wide loop is formed over the lower part of the vein and the branches arise from the loop. Sometimes the two nerves join, Y-shaped, high up and the branches are given off from the stem of the Y. In either case they are distributed to the infrahyoid muscles (sternohyoid, sternothyroid and omohyoid) segmentally, C1, C2 and C3 from above down.</p><p>The upper part of the hypoglossal nerve is described on page 465. In the submandibular region it emerges between the internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein deep to the posterior belly of digastric. Hooking round the occipital artery it curves forwards over the external carotid and the loop of the lingual artery (Fig. 6.17). As it crosses these three arteries it lies just below digastric, behind its tendon and just above the tip of the greater horn of the hyoid bone; this is where to look for it in dissections. Here it gives off the superior root of the ansa cervicalis. It passes forwards on the surface of hyoglossus which separates it from the lingual artery, giving off the branch to thyrohyoid (C1 fibres) and then running deep to mylohyoid to enter the mouth (p. 484).</p><h2 id=submandibular-region>Submandibular Region
<a class=anchor href=#submandibular-region>#</a></h2><p>The hyoid bone is connected to the mandible by a thin sheet of muscle, the mylohyoids (p. 428), which form the floor of the mouth. Superficially (i.e. below it) lies the anterior belly of digastric. The nerve to mylohyoid and the submental branch of the facial artery run between the two, while lying upon it, half hidden under the mandible, are the submandibular salivary gland and lymph nodes. These structures are covered in by the investing layer of deep cervical fascia, which is attached to the hyoid bone and the inferior border of the mandible. In the subcutaneous tissue lie the platysma muscle, the anterior jugular veins and the submental lymph nodes. The skin of this region is supplied by the upper division of the transverse cervical nerve (C2).</p><h3 id=platysma>Platysma
<a class=anchor href=#platysma>#</a></h3><p>This part of the panniculus carnosus forms a broad flat sheet that extends from the deep fascia over the upper part of pectoralis major and the most anterior part of deltoid to the lower border of the mandible, with some fibres reaching the lateral part of the lower lip by passing beneath depressor anguli oris. The muscle covers the external and anterior jugular veins. The two muscles are separated below, but converge above towards the midline and overlap just beneath the chin. The lateral border of each muscle slants up across the parotid gland and converges into a triangle whose apex is attached to the modiolus, constituting the risorius muscle.</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> By the cervical branch of the facial nerve, but afferent (proprioceptive) fibres run with the transverse cervical nerve.</p><p><strong>Action.</strong> It plays a part in facial expression and may assist in opening the mouth. In forcibly showing the teeth (p. 641) and in strenuous activity it raises longitudinal ridges of cervical skin, and possibly helps to relieve pressure on cervical veins. In facelift operations it can be attached to sternocleidomastoid high up behind the ear; skin is mobilized superficial to the muscle to avoid damage to its nerve supply.</p><h3 id=anterior-jugular-veins>Anterior Jugular Veins
<a class=anchor href=#anterior-jugular-veins>#</a></h3><p>These commence beneath the chin and pass downwards, side by side beneath the platysma, to the suprasternal region (Fig. 6.4). Here they pierce the deep fascia and come to lie in the suprasternal space, where they are often connected by a short anastomotic vein. Each now angles laterally and passes deep to sternocleidomastoid to open into the external jugular vein after the latter has pierced the deep fascia.</p><h3 id=submental-and-submandibular-lymph-nodes>Submental and Submandibular Lymph Nodes
<a class=anchor href=#submental-and-submandibular-lymph-nodes>#</a></h3><p>Three or four small submental nodes lie beneath the chin, some superficial and others deep to the investing layer of deep cervical fascia. They drain, across the midline, a wedge of tissue in the floor of the mouth opposite the four lower incisor teeth, including those teeth, gums and lip, and the tip of the tongue (see p. 482). In their turn they drain to submandibular nodes or directly to the upper deep cervical group (Fig. 6.57).</p><p>Half a dozen submandibular lymph nodes lie on the surface of the submandibular gland, though some may be embedded within the gland. They drain the submental nodes, the lateral parts of the lower lips, all the upper lip and external nose, and the anterior part of the tongue, mainly but not exclusively from their own side. They also receive from the anterior half of the nasal walls and the paranasal sinuses that drain there (frontal, anterior and middle ethmoidal, and maxillary), and all teeth (except lower incisors).</p><h3 id=submandibular-fossa>Submandibular Fossa
<a class=anchor href=#submandibular-fossa>#</a></h3><p>This space lies deep to the investing layer of deep cervical fascia and the inferior border of the mandible. The fascia is attached to the inferior border of the mandible and to the whole length of the hyoid bone up to the tip of the greater horn. It is a demonstrable membrane that spans the fossa and supports the submandibular gland, giving only a very tenuous capsule round the deep surface of the gland (nothing like as thick as that of the parotid gland). Deep to this the fossa extends to the mylohyoid muscle (Fig. 6.5); the space thus projects upwards under cover of the mandible as high as the mylohyoid line. Swelling in the space is limited by the attachments of the mylohyoid muscle and the deep fascia; distension of the space is.</p><p>The nerve to mylohyoid branches from the inferior alveolar nerve at the mandibular foramen (p. 461) and pierces the sphenomandibular ligament at its attachment to the inferior margin of the foramen. It is accompanied by small branches of the inferior alveolar artery and vein; the vessels indent the mandible, forming the mylohyoid groove. The groove marks the upper limit of the attachment of the medial pterygoid muscle (Fig. 8.14, p. 664). The small artery supplies the periosteum and some fibres of the medial pterygoid; the nerve, however, passes forwards on the neck surface of the mylohyoid muscle. It ends between the anterior belly of digastric and mylohyoid, supplying both. It is accompanied by the submental branch of the facial artery, which gives off a branch that perforates the mylohyoid to supply the anterior part of the floor of the mouth, including the sublingual gland. Submental veins run back to the facial vein. Lymphatics pierce the anterior part of mylohyoid to drain tip of tongue and floor of mouth into the submental lymph nodes (Fig. 6.24, p. 482).</p><h2 id=submandibular-gland>Submandibular Gland
<a class=anchor href=#submandibular-gland>#</a></h2><p>The submandibular gland, mixed mucous and serous in man, consists of a large superficial part and a small deep part which are continuous with one another round the free posterior margin of mylohyoid (Fig. 6.17).</p><p>The superficial part fills some of the space between the mandible, mylohyoid and the investing layer of deep cervical fascia, and so has three surfaces which may be called lateral, inferior and medial. The lateral surface lies against the submandibular fossa of the mandible (p. 664), overlapping the front of the medial pterygoid insertion and being deeply grooved posteriorly by the facial artery which hooks under the mandible to reach the face at the front of the masseter muscle. The inferior or superficial surface is covered by skin, platysma and the investing fascia and is crossed by the facial vein and the cervical branch of the facial nerve, and also by the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve if unusually low (p. 450). Submandibular lymph nodes lie not only in contact with the surface of the gland but also within its substance - hence the need to remove the gland as well as nodes in the operation of radical neck dissection. Most of the medial surface lies against mylohyoid and its vessels, but towards the back it overlaps hyoglossus and the lingual nerve, submandibular ganglion, hypoglossal nerve and deep lingual vein.</p><p>The deep part of the gland extends forwards for a variable distance, sometimes only a few millimetres, between mylohyoid and hyoglossus, with the lingual nerve above it and the submandibular duct and hypoglossal nerve below it.</p><p>The submandibular duct (of Wharton) is 5 cm long (the same length as the parotid duct) and emerges from the superficial part of the gland near the posterior border of mylohyoid. It runs forwards first between mylohyoid and hyoglossus and then between the sublingual gland and geniohyoid, to open into the floor of the mouth beside the frenulum (p. 484).</p><h3 id=blood-supply-2>Blood Supply

<a class=anchor href=#surgical-approach-2>#</a></h3><p>The superficial part is easy to expose under platysma, but the skin incision must be made about 4 cm below the mandible to avoid the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve which may lie over the gland (p. 450). Removal of the gland requires ligation of the facial artery and vein above and below it, and the gland is dissected away from the lingual nerve, with ligation of the duct as it lies on hyoglossus. The removal of a stone from the duct is carried out from within the mouth by incising the duct over the stone; the duct does not need to be sutured.</p><h2 id=principal-vessels-of-the-neck>Principal Vessels of the Neck
<a class=anchor href=#principal-vessels-of-the-neck>#</a></h2><p>The principal vessels of the neck are the common, external and internal carotid arteries and the internal jugular vein. The course of the common carotid artery within the carotid sheath has already been noted (p. 434).</p><h3 id=external-carotid-artery>External Carotid Artery
<a class=anchor href=#external-carotid-artery>#</a></h3><p>The external carotid artery commences at the bifurcation of the common carotid (p. 434), near the greater horn of the hyoid bone. At first somewhat medial to, it slopes upwards in front of, the internal carotid artery and passes deep to the posterior belly of digastric and stylohyoid, above which it pierces the deep lamina of the parotid fascia and enters the gland. It divides when within the gland behind the neck of the mandible into maxillary and superficial temporal arteries.</p><p>At its commencement the external carotid lies against the side wall of the pharynx; its place is soon taken by the internal carotid artery, which then lies against the pharynx all the way up to the base of the skull. As the external carotid artery lies in the parotid gland it is separated from the internal carotid by the deep part of the gland and the pharyngeal structures: stylopharyngeus muscle, glossopharyngeal nerve and pharyngeal branch of the vagus (and, if present, the track of a branchial fistula). At the commencement of the artery the internal jugular vein lies lateral, but higher up it is posterior and deep to the artery. The facial vein crosses the artery, with the hypoglossal nerve lying between.</p><p>The surface marking of the external carotid is along a line from the bifurcation of the common carotid near the greater horn of the hyoid, passing behind the angle of the mandible to a point immediately in front of the tragus of the ear.</p><p><strong>Surgical approach.</strong> The vessel can be exposed in front of the upper part of sternocleidomastoid before entering the parotid gland by ligating the facial vein and incising the carotid sheath. The hypoglossal nerve which crosses the external and internal carotids superficially must not be damaged.</p><p><strong>Branches.</strong> Before it enters the parotid gland the external carotid artery gives off six branches, three from in front, two from behind and one deep (medial). The three from in front are the superior thyroid, lingual and facial, and they diverge widely. The two from behind are the occipital and posterior auricular, which pass up along the lower and upper borders of the posterior belly of digastric. The branch from the medial side is the ascending pharyngeal, which ascends to the base of the skull on the side wall of the pharynx, alongside the internal carotid artery.</p><p><strong>Superior Thyroid Artery.</strong> The superior thyroid artery arises at the commencement of the external carotid. It slopes almost vertically downwards, with the vein, to the upper pole of the thyroid gland (p. 431). Close behind it, alongside the larynx, lies the external laryngeal nerve (Fig. 6.17). The main branch is the superior laryngeal artery which pierces the thyrohyoid membrane with the internal laryngeal nerve. It also gives a branch to sternocleidomastoid.</p><p><strong>Lingual Artery.</strong> The lingual artery arises from the front of the external carotid above the superior thyroid. It forms a short upward loop (Fig. 6.17), then passes forwards along the upper border of the greater horn of the hyoid bone, deep to hyoglossus (p. 482). It is accompanied by the deep lingual vein which passes back to the sublingual vein. It is crossed by the hypoglossal nerve and its companion vein, the latter opening into the facial vein. The facial vein overlies the hypoglossal nerve and the loop of the lingual artery on its way to the internal jugular.</p><p><strong>Facial Artery.</strong> The facial artery arises from the front of the external carotid above the lingual artery (sometimes by a common linguofacial trunk with the lingual) and runs upwards on the superior constrictor, deep to the digastric and stylohyoid muscles, then deep to the submandibular salivary gland. It indents the surface of the gland. As the artery lies on the superior constrictor muscle it gives off a tonsillar branch to the tonsil and soft palate. The facial artery then makes an S-bend, curling down over the submandibular gland (Fig. 6.25) and up over the mandible, whose periosteum it supplies. Just before it crosses the inferior border of the mandible, where its pulsation can be felt 2.5 cm in front of the angle at the anterior border of masseter, it gives off a sizable branch, the submental artery, which accompanies the mylohyoid nerve into the submandibular fossa. There it supplies the anterior belly of digastric and mylohyoid, and sends perforating branches through the floor of the mouth to the sublingual gland.</p><p><strong>Occipital Artery.</strong> The occipital artery arises from the back of the external carotid on a level with the facial artery. It courses along the lower border of the posterior belly of digastric, passing deeper and grooving the base of the skull at the occipitomastoid suture deep to the digastric notch on the mastoid process. It passes back through the apex of the posterior triangle to supply the back of the scalp (p. 453). The artery gives off two branches to sternocleidomastoid. The upper branch is a guide to the accessory nerve in front of the upper border of the muscle. The artery at its origin is crossed by the hypoglossal nerve, which hooks around it from behind; here the nerve is held down by the lower sternocleidomastoid branch of the artery (Fig. 6.17).</p><p><strong>Posterior Auricular Artery.</strong> The posterior auricular artery arises above the level of the digastric muscle, sometimes within the substance of the parotid gland. It runs up superficial to the styloid process across the upper border of digastric, and crosses the surface of the mastoid process. It supplies the skin over the mastoid process; it is cut in incisions for mastoid operations. Auricular branches supply the pinna of the ear. Its stylomastoid branch enters the stylomastoid foramen, supplies the facial nerve and gives off the stapedial artery to the stapedius muscle, of interest as being the remnant of the artery of the second pharyngeal arch (p. 40).</p><p><strong>Ascending Pharyngeal Artery.</strong> The ascending pharyngeal artery arises just above the commencement of the external carotid, from its deep aspect. It runs up along the side wall of the pharynx in front of the prevertebral fascia, deep to the internal carotid artery. It supplies the pharyngeal wall and the soft palate and sends meningeal branches through the foramina nearby (foramen lacerum, jugular foramen, hypoglossal canal).</p><h3 id=internal-carotid-artery>Internal Carotid Artery
<a class=anchor href=#internal-carotid-artery>#</a></h3><p>The internal carotid artery arises at the bifurcation of the common carotid (p. 434) and continues upwards within the carotid sheath (p. 462). At its commencement it shows a slight bulge, the carotid sinus. Here the arterial wall is thin and its contained baroreceptors are supplied by the carotid sinus branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve which mediates blood pressure impulses to medullary centres. The carotid body is a small yellowish-grey structure lying behind the bifurcation of the common carotid artery, from which it receives two or three very small glomic arteries. Its cells are chemoreceptors concerned (like the aortic bodies - p. 256) with respiratory reflexes, and in proportion to its size it has the highest blood flow of any organ in the body. Its glomus cells, which have vesicles containing dopamine, are innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve. Carotid body tumours form a swelling at the anterior border of sternocleidomastoid at the level of the carotid bifurcation, and exhibit transmitted pulsation from the arteries.</p><p>The internal carotid artery is really external (lateral) to the external carotid at its origin, but soon slopes up posteriorly to occupy a medial and deeper level. It has no branches and passes straight up in the carotid sheath and beside the pharynx to the carotid canal in the base of the skull, wherein its further course is considered on page 570.</p><p>Behind the internal carotid artery in the neck is the sympathetic trunk (outside the carotid sheath), and the pharyngeal veins usually pass behind to reach the internal jugular vein. The superior laryngeal branch of the vagus crosses obliquely behind to reach its medial side where it divides into the internal and external laryngeal nerves. The ascending pharyngeal artery is also medial to it. The internal jugular vein is lateral, with the vagus nerve deeply placed between artery and vein. Superficially near its origin it is crossed by the lingual and facial veins, the occipital artery and hypoglossal nerve; the superior root of the ansa cervicalis runs downwards along it, embedded in the carotid sheath. At a higher level it is overlapped by sternocleidomastoid and crossed by the posterior belly of digastric and stylohyoid and the posterior auricular artery, and by the structures that separate it from the external carotid, namely stylopharyngeus, the glossopharyngeal nerve and the pharyngeal branch of the vagus (and if present the track of a branchial fistula).</p><p>The surface marking of the internal carotid artery in the neck is along a line from the bifurcation of the common carotid artery near the greater horn of the hyoid bone to the head of the mandible.</p><p><strong>Surgical approach.</strong> The internal carotid is exposed by retracting the upper part of sternocleidomastoid backwards, ligating the facial vein and incising the carotid sheath.</p><h3 id=internal-jugular-vein>Internal Jugular Vein
<a class=anchor href=#internal-jugular-vein>#</a></h3><p>The internal jugular vein emerges from the jugular bulb at the posterior compartment of the jugular foramen. At first behind the internal carotid artery, it lies on the lateral mass of the atlas, crossed by the accessory nerve. It receives the inferior petrosal sinus as its first tributary, just below the base of the skull; the sinus passes back lateral (or sometimes medial) to the vagus nerve. The vein passes down to gain the lateral side of the internal carotid artery within the loose lateral part of the carotid sheath, with the vagus nerve deeply placed between the vein and arteries. In the lower part of their course the vessels are overlaid by the sloping sternocleidomastoid. Deep cervical lymph nodes are closely adjacent to the vein throughout its course. Its posterior relations include the cervical plexus lying on levator scapulae and scalenus medius, and the phrenic nerve on scalenus anterior. The thoracic duct crosses behind the left vein at the level of C7 vertebra. The inferior root of the ansa cervicalis curls round its lateral border, to unite with the superior root (from the hypoglossal nerve) at a variable level in front of the vein. Low down the tendon of omohyoid crosses the vein, providing a useful guide to its position. The termination of the vein lies beneath the triangular interval between the sternal and clavicular head of sternocleidomastoid, where it joins the subclavian to form the brachiocephalic vein.</p><p>The surface marking of the internal jugular vein is along a line from the lobule of the ear to the sternal end of the clavicle. The jugular venous pulse is a guide to jugular venous pressure, which is the same as right atrial or central venous pressure and thus an important indicator of cardiovascular function. With a patient reclining at 45° the jugular venous pulse should be visible just above the clavicle.</p><p><strong>Catheterization.</strong> The right internal jugular vein (on a direct path to the right atrium) can be cannulated for the insertion of a central venous line, for measurements of central venous pressure or the rapid administration of drugs when a peripheral approach would be too slow. The vein is usually approached from a point 5 cm above the clavicle at the posterior border of sternocleidomastoid, and the needle is directed towards the jugular notch, entering the vein in about 4-5 cm. It can also be entered from 2 cm above the clavicle between the two heads of sternocleidomastoid in a backward and slightly lateral direction. (The subclavian vein is an alternative p. 442.) The commonest complication is haematoma formation and perhaps puncture of the more medially situated common carotid artery.</p><p>Now that the regions of the anterior and posterior triangles have been studied, it is convenient to record in summary form the principal features, not simply as mere lists for recital parrot fashion but as an aid to recalling where to locate them, always remembering that some important structures such as the internal jugular vein, common carotid artery and vagus nerve are under cover of the undisturbed sternocleidomastoid and so do not appear in these triangles.</p><h3 id=posterior-triangle-summary>Posterior Triangle Summary

<a class=anchor href=#prevertebral-muscles>#</a></h2><p>Some relatively weak flexor muscles extend in front of the vertebral column from skull to superior mediastinum. They are covered anteriorly by the strong prevertebral fascia (Fig. 6.6), upon whose slippery surface the pharynx and oesophagus glide freely during neck movements or swallowing.</p><h3 id=rectus-capitis-anterior>Rectus Capitis Anterior
<a class=anchor href=#rectus-capitis-anterior>#</a></h3><p>Rectus capitis lateralis lies edge to edge with the former muscle; it extends from the lateral mass of the atlas to the jugular process of the occipital bone. The anterior ramus of C1, passing forwards lateral to the atlanto-occipital joint, supplies each muscle and then passes between them to sink into the overlying longus capitis muscle. It gives a branch to the hypoglossal nerve, which is distributed in the meningeal branch, the superior root of the ansa cervicalis and the branches to thyrohyoid and geniohyoid. These two small rectus muscles assist in flexion and lateral flexion of the head.</p><h3 id=longus-capitis>Longus Capitis
<a class=anchor href=#longus-capitis>#</a></h3><p>Longus capitis is attached by four slender tendons, in line with those of scalenus anterior, to the anterior tubercles of the four typical cervical vertebrae (C3-6). The ribbon-shaped muscle so formed is inserted into the basiocciput, the two muscles lying side by side in front of the foramen magnum alongside the pharyngeal tubercle. The muscles bulge slightly into the upper part of the nasopharynx. They are supplied segmentally by anterior rami of the upper four cervical nerves. Their action is to flex the skull and upper neck; they are weak because their action is assisted by gravity and by the powerful sternocleidomastoids.</p><h3 id=longus-colli>Longus Colli
<a class=anchor href=#longus-colli>#</a></h3><p>Longus colli extends from the anterior tubercle of the atlas into the superior mediastinum. It consists of upper, lower and central fibres. The upper fibres connect the anterior tubercle of the atlas with the anterior tubercles of the transverse processes of C3-5 vertebrae. The lower fibres connect the bodies of T1-3 vertebrae with the anterior tubercles on the transverse processes of C5 and 6 vertebrae. The lateral border of this lower part makes with the medial border of scalenus anterior a pyramidal space whose apex is the carotid tubercle (of Chassaignac) and whose base is the first part of the subclavian artery. In this space lie the vertebral artery and cervical sympathetic trunk with the stellate ganglion (Fig. 6.8). The central fibres of longus colli connect the bodies of C2-4 vertebrae with the remaining cervical and the upper three thoracic vertebrae (Fig. 6.6).</p><p>Longus colli is supplied segmentally by the anterior rami of the spinal nerves. It is a flexor of the neck, weak because it is aided by gravity and the strong sternocleidomastoids.</p><p>The prevertebral fascia is considered on page 423.</p><h2 id=cervical-sympathetic-trunk>Cervical Sympathetic Trunk
<a class=anchor href=#cervical-sympathetic-trunk>#</a></h2><p>The cervical part of the sympathetic trunk (Fig. 6.6) ascends from the thorax across the neck of the first rib, medial to the highest intercostal vein. It runs up medial to the vertebral artery and lies in front of the prevertebral fascia, to which it is attached by loose areolar tissue. It ends at the superior cervical ganglion. The trunk lies behind the carotid sheath, just medial to the vagus nerve.</p><p>The superior cervical ganglion, containing about 1 million cell bodies, is about 3 cm long and lies in front of the lateral mass of the atlas and axis. The middle cervical ganglion is a small, inconstant ganglion lying on the trunk medial to the carotid tubercle (C6 vertebra) and in front of the vertebral artery. The inferior cervical ganglion lies behind the commencement of the vertebral artery. A small mass when separate, it is more often fused with the first thoracic ganglion to form the stellate ganglion, properly called the cervicothoracic ganglion, a mass which may measure as much as 1 cm by 0.5 cm, lying in front of the neck of the first rib. The middle ganglion is connected to the inferior ganglion (or stellate ganglion when present) by a part of the trunk which passes in front of the subclavian artery, the ansa subclavia (Fig. 6.8). It often lies lower, and joins the inferior cervical to the first or second thoracic ganglion.</p><p>No white rami enter the ganglia from the cervical nerves: all the fibres ascend from the thoracic part of the trunk. As elsewhere, the branches of the ganglia are somatic and visceral in their distribution.</p><p>Somatic branches pass as grey rami to all eight cervical nerves. The superior ganglion gives grey rami to the first four (i.e. to the cervical plexus), the middle ganglion to the next two (5 and 6) and the inferior ganglion to the last two (7 and 8) anterior rami (i.e. to the brachial plexus for distribution to the upper limb).</p><p>Visceral branches include a branch from each ganglion to the cardiac plexus. The branch from the upper left ganglion runs down to the superficial part, the other two left and all three right ganglionic branches all pass to the deep part. All six cardiac branches pass through the neck behind the common carotid artery and usually behind the subclavian artery to reach the superior mediastinum.</p><p>Vascular branches hitchhike their way along arteries. The superior ganglion gives branches to the internal carotid and external carotid arteries. The one or more branches that accompany the internal carotid artery into the skull constitute the internal carotid nerve. As well as accompanying all branches of the artery the fibres (forming the internal carotid plexus) are distributed to the pterygopalatine ganglion and the eyeball, the latter including the motor supply of the dilator pupillae of the iris. The plexus on the external carotid artery accompanies all branches of the vessel and in addition supplies sympathetic fibres to the pharyngeal plexus.</p><p>The middle cervical ganglion gives branches to the subclavian and inferior thyroid arteries - the latter supply the lower larynx, the trachea, the hypopharynx and the upper oesophagus. The branches to the subclavian artery are for only its local branches. The branches along the inferior thyroid artery are visceral only (not somatic).</p><p>The inferior cervical ganglion gives a large branch to the vertebral artery (the vertebral plexus) which runs with all the branches of that vessel. It supplies only the branches of the vertebral artery (no viscera).</p><h2 id=root-of-the-neck>Root of the Neck
<a class=anchor href=#root-of-the-neck>#</a></h2><p>The root of the neck lies above the apex of the lung; to understand the former is to appreciate the relations of the latter. The key to the root of the neck is the scalenus anterior muscle (Fig. 6.7A). Study its relations precisely; they comprise almost all that needs to be known of the part. Thence pass to the thoracic inlet and note the structures that pass through it between the apices of the lungs.</p><h3 id=scalenus-anterior>Scalenus Anterior
<a class=anchor href=#scalenus-anterior>#</a></h3><p>This flat muscle arises from the anterior tubercles of the four typical cervical vertebrae (3-6), the lowest and largest being the carotid tubercle of the sixth. At these tubercles four slender tendons of origin lie end to end with those of longus capitis (Fig. 6.6). The muscle slopes forwards and laterally as it passes down to end in a narrow tendon attached to the scalene tubercle and adjacent ridge on the inner border and upper surface of the first rib. It belongs to the group of prevertebral flexor muscles of the neck, and with them is covered by a prolongation of prevertebral fascia, the foundation upon which the viscera of the neck gain their mobility.</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> By separate branches from the anterior rami of C4, 5, 6 nerves.</p><p><strong>Action.</strong> It is more important as a landmark than an active muscle. It assists in flexion and rotation of the neck, and helps to stabilize the first rib. Even in quiet respiration it shows some electromyographic activity.</p><h3 id=anterior-relations>Anterior Relations
<a class=anchor href=#anterior-relations>#</a></h3><p>The phrenic nerve passes vertically down across the obliquity of the muscle, plastered thereto by the prevertebral fascia (Fig. 6.8). The nerve leaves the medial border of the muscle low down and crosses the subclavian artery and its internal thoracic branch behind the subclavian vein. Lying on the suprapleural membrane it passes medial to the apex of the lung, in front of the vagus nerve, to enter the superior mediastinum. The nerve not infrequently lies in front of the subclavian vein. The ascending cervical artery is a branch of the inferior thyroid artery or the thyrocervical trunk. It runs up on the prevertebral fascia medial to the phrenic nerve. The uninjected artery can easily be mistaken for the nerve in a dissecting room specimen.</p><p>The subclavian vein lies in a groove on the first rib and, due to the slope of the rib, lies at a lower level than the insertion of scalenus anterior. It is a large vessel 1 cm or more in diameter, and maintains its diameter even in hypovolaemic states because of adherence to surrounding connective tissues. It runs below the clavicle and subclavius, and joins the internal jugular vein at the medial border of scalenus anterior; the thoracic duct on the left and the right lymph duct on the right enter the angle of confluence of the two veins. The vein is too low to be included among the contents of the posterior triangle (p. 439).</p><p><strong>Catheterization.</strong> The right subclavian vein can be used for the placement of a central venous line, instead of the internal jugular (p. 439); it is preferred by many operators and is more comfortable for the patient. The usual approach is infraclavicular, from a point 2 cm below the midpoint of the clavicle along a line towards the jugular notch of the sternum. The needle pierces the clavipectoral fascia and enters the vein just behind the fascia. The commonest complications are pneumothorax due to puncture of the pleura and lung, and puncture of the subclavian artery. The vein is also used for the placement of wires from cardiac pacemakers, which are usually implanted in connective tissue over the upper lateral part of pectoralis major.</p><p>In front of the lower part of the carotid sheath runs the intermediate tendon of the omohyoid. All the structures enumerated above are covered in front by the lower part of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (Fig. 6.4).</p><h3 id=medial-relations>Medial Relations
<a class=anchor href=#medial-relations>#</a></h3><p>The edge of longus colli runs up to the anterior tubercle on the transverse process of C6 vertebra. It makes, with the medial edge of scalenus anterior, a pyramidal space; the base of the space is formed by the subclavian artery, and the neck of the first rib, between which lies the suprapleural membrane. Note that the apex of the pyramidal space is the carotid (Chassaignac&rsquo;s) tubercle (Figs 6.6 and 6.8), so named because the common carotid artery lies on it and can be there compressed. The common carotid artery, medial to the internal jugular vein, lies deep to sternocleidomastoid immediately in front of the pyramidal space.</p><p>The space contains the stellate ganglion and the vertebral artery and vein(s) (Figs 6.7A and 6.8). The inferior thyroid artery arches medially in a bold curve whose upper convexity lies in front of the apex of the pyramidal space (C6 level). At a lower level, and further forward, the thoracic duct (or right lymphatic duct) makes a similar convexity as it arches over the lung apex and subclavian artery to enter the confluence of the subclavian and internal jugular veins (Fig. 6.8). The first part of the subclavian artery arches over the suprapleural membrane and impresses a groove upon the apex of the lung; it disappears behind scalenus anterior. It has three branches. The vertebral artery is the first; it arises from the upper convexity of the subclavian and passes up to disappear, at the apex of the pyramidal space, into the foramen of the transverse process of C6 vertebra. The sympathetic plexus on the vertebral artery is often a single nerve that runs up behind the vessel. Medial but anterior to it lies the middle cervical ganglion, while medial but posterior to it and a little lower is the inferior cervical or stellate ganglion. A connecting loop between middle and inferior cervical ganglia passes in front of the subclavian artery, forming the ansa subclavia. The thyrocervical trunk arises lateral to the vertebral artery from the upper surface of the subclavian. It divides immediately into transverse cervical, suprascapular and inferior thyroid arteries, which have already been noted. The internal thoracic artery arises from the lower surface of the subclavian.</p><p>The vertebral vein emerges from the foramen in the transverse process of C6 vertebra and runs forward across the apex of the lung and beneath the subclavian artery to empty into the brachiocephalic vein (Fig. 6.7B). It may be accompanied by a companion vein that passes through the foramen of the transverse process of C7 vertebra.</p><h3 id=posterior-relations>Posterior Relations
<a class=anchor href=#posterior-relations>#</a></h3><p>Scalenus anterior is separated from scalenus medius by the subclavian artery and the anterior rami of the lower cervical and first thoracic nerves. The last named occupies the subclavian groove, the subclavian artery usually lying somewhat further above the rib. The second part of the subclavian artery is that part which lies behind scalenus anterior. Here the fourth branch of the artery arises, the costocervical trunk (Fig. 4.5, p. 247). It passes back across the suprapleural membrane towards the neck of the first rib and there divides into a descending branch, the superior intercostal artery, which enters the thorax across the neck of the first rib and an ascending branch, the deep cervical artery, which passes beneath the transverse process of C7 vertebra and runs upwards behind the transverse processes, in front of semispinalis capitis, to anastomose with the occipital artery.</p><p>The trunks of the brachial plexus and the third part of the subclavian artery emerge from the lateral border of scalenus anterior. They lie behind the prevertebral fascia, which plasters them down upon the floor of the posterior triangle (p. 426) and is projected along them into the axilla as the axillary sheath. No such sheath surrounds the axillary and subclavian veins; the latter lies in front of the prevertebral fascia and is free to dilate to accommodate an increased blood flow. The prevertebral fascia is attached to bone at the edge of longus colli and is projected down from above over scalenus anterior, being attached to its medial border. There is no fascial roof across the pyramidal space between the two muscles and the subclavian artery by passing in behind scalenus anterior passes behind the lateral expansion of the prevertebral fascia (Fig. 6.8). The fifth and last branch of the artery, the dorsal scapular, usually arises from this part (though sometimes from the second part). It runs laterally in front of scalenus medius and through the brachial plexus, and then disappears deep to levator scapulae to take part in the scapular anastomosis (p. 74). It is frequently replaced by the deep branch of the transverse cervical artery, and this branch then takes the name of dorsal scapular. Occasionally, the transverse cervical or suprascapular artery or both arise from the third part of the subclavian artery (that is, behind the prevertebral fascia), in which case they pass laterally between the trunks of the brachial plexus.</p><p><strong>Surgical approach.</strong> The artery can be exposed by detaching the clavicular head of sternocleidomastoid from the clavicle and then detaching scalenus anterior from the first rib, taking particular care not to damage the phrenic nerve.</p><h3 id=scalenus-medius-and-scalenus-posterior>Scalenus Medius and Scalenus Posterior
<a class=anchor href=#scalenus-medius-and-scalenus-posterior>#</a></h3><p>Scalenus medius arises from the posterior tubercles and intertubercular lamellae of all the cervical vertebrae and is inserted into the quadrangular area between the neck and subclavian groove of the first rib (Fig. 4.39, p. 292).</p><p>Scalenus posterior arises from the posterior tubercles of the lower cervical vertebrae, passes across the outer border of the first rib deep to the upper digitation of serratus anterior, and is inserted into the second rib along its outer border, behind the serratus anterior attachment.</p><p><strong>Nerve supplies.</strong> Both muscles are supplied segmentally by the anterior rami of the lower cervical nerves, scalenus medius by C3-8 and scalenus posterior by C6-8.</p><p><strong>Actions.</strong> Both muscles are mainly lateral flexors of the neck, but can act as elevators of the ribs and thus as accessory muscles of respiration.</p><p>The midline structures in the root of the neck consist of trachea and oesophagus (p. 433) the thoracic duct (p. 444) and the recurrent laryngeal nerves. These nerves run up in the groove between trachea and oesophagus, and their relationships to the thyroid gland and its inferior arteries have been described (p. 431). They give branches to the cervical parts of oesophagus and trachea and to the cricopharyngeus, and enter the lower part of the pharynx below the inferior border of cricopharyngeus (Fig. 6.30).</p><h2 id=face>Face
<a class=anchor href=#face>#</a></h2><p>The face is the part of the front of the head between the ears and from the chin to the hairline (or where it ought to be if you have lost it!). The facial skeleton is the front part of the skull, including the mandible, described on page 647. The major openings are the two orbits, the piriform (anterior nasal) aperture, and the oral aperture between the jaws. The supraorbital, infraorbital and mental foramina lie in approximately the same vertical plane.</p><h3 id=skin-of-the-face>Skin of the Face
<a class=anchor href=#skin-of-the-face>#</a></h3><p>Tension lines in facial skin tend to run in an onion skin pattern from mouth to ear (Fig. 1.2, p. 3). Senile facial wrinkles lie at right angles to the line of pull of the underlying muscles (horizontal wrinkles on the brow, crow&rsquo;s foot wrinkles at the lateral canthus, vertical wrinkles on both lips). Incisions along these wrinkles heal with minimal scarring.</p><h3 id=muscles-of-the-face>Muscles of the Face
<a class=anchor href=#muscles-of-the-face>#</a></h3><p>Embryologically the muscles of facial expression are developed from the mesoderm of the second pharyngeal arch, from which they migrate widely to their adult positions. They are supplied by the nerve of the second arch, the seventh cranial (facial) nerve. They are, morphologically, specialized members of the panniculus carnosus (p. 3). The essential point here is that the panniculus carnosus is in places attached to the dermis, which it therefore wrinkles or dimples. There is no deep fascia on the face.</p><p>Functionally the muscles are differentiated to form groups around the orifices. The orifices of orbit, nose and mouth are guarded by eyelids, nostrils and lips and there is a sphincter and an opposing dilator arrangement peculiar to each. The purpose of the facial muscles is to control these orifices. The varying expressions so produced on the face are side effects; man has educated himself to be particularly sensitive to minor changes of expressions so produced on the faces of his fellows. Some of the muscles supplied by the facial nerve are incapable of affecting the expression of the face; moreover, certain facial expressions full of meaning are produced by muscles (e.g. levator palpebrae superioris, ocular muscles, tongue) not supplied by the facial nerve. Normal facial appearances have little to do with the underlying muscles; we all have the same muscles but how different we all look, unless we are identical twins! It is the contour of the overlying connective tissues and the way they are connected to the muscles (determined by genetic expression) which produce the end result. The muscles of facial expression are best understood and remembered by appreciating their functional arrangement around the orbits, nose and mouth (Fig. 6.9), and it is strongly recommended that the muscles be studied in these functional groups.</p><h3 id=orbicularis-oculi>Orbicularis Oculi
<a class=anchor href=#orbicularis-oculi>#</a></h3><p>Orbicularis oculi is rightly described in two parts, the palpebral part, confined to the lids, and the orbital part, extending beyond the bony orbital margins on to the face. The palpebral part consists of fibres that arise from the medial palpebral ligament and arch across both lids, anterior to the tarsal plates, and are inserted into the lateral palpebral raphe. Some of the lower fibres are attached medially to the posterior lacrimal crest and the lacrimal sac itself. The orbital part, much the larger, arises from the anterior lacrimal crest and the frontal process of the maxilla, whence the fibres circumscribe the orbital margin in a series of concentric loops. The muscle lies flat over the forehead and cheek (frontal and zygomatic bones).</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> By temporal and zygomatic branches of the facial nerve.</p><p><strong>Action.</strong> Contraction of the palpebral fibres closes the lids gently without burying the eyelashes, and stretches the lacrimal sac (p. 508). This movement of blinking does not diminish the volume of the conjunctival sac, and even when the eye is brimful of tears none are spilt when the eyelids close. When the orbital part contracts it lowers the eyebrow, to shade the eye from a light that is too bright from above. Orbital and palpebral parts contracting together close the eyelids forcibly so that the eyelashes are buried and only their tips are visible. This movement (screwing up the eyes) diminishes the volume of the conjunctival sac, and causes an eye that is brimful of tears to spill out over the cheek. In normal closing of the eye, the lateral part of the upper lid comes down before the medial part, so helping to spread lacrimal secretion from the gland side (lateral) towards the nose.</p><p>Levator palpebrae superioris is the opponent of the sphincter of the palpebral fissure, i.e. of the palpebral fibres of orbicularis oculi. It is described with the orbital muscles (p. 509).</p><p>Occipitofrontalis is considered with the scalp on page 453.</p><h3 id=muscles-of-the-nose>Muscles of the Nose
<a class=anchor href=#muscles-of-the-nose>#</a></h3><p>The sphincter muscle of the nostril is the transverse part of nasalis (compressor naris), which embraces the alar cartilages, and its opponent is the alar part of nasalis (dilator naris), which is inserted into the lateral part of the ala. Each arises from the maxilla. The nose, in addition, can be elevated somewhat by procerus and levator labii superioris alaeque nasi and depressed by the depressor septi, much weaker because its action is assisted by elastic recoil of the nasal cartilages. All are supplied by zygomatic and buccal branches of the facial nerve.</p><h3 id=muscles-of-the-mouth>Muscles of the Mouth
<a class=anchor href=#muscles-of-the-mouth>#</a></h3><p>The sphincter is the orbicularis oris; the dilator mechanism consists of the remainder of the facial muscles, which radiate outwards from the lips like the spokes of a wheel.</p><p><strong>Orbicularis Oris.</strong> Orbicularis oris consists of fibres proper to itself, attached near the midline to upper and lower jaws, and fibres that are added to these from the dilator muscles. The intrinsic fibres are attached to bone near the midline and well away from the alveolar margin. The incisive and mental slips curve around the angle of the mouth in a loop on either side (Fig. 6.10). They are the deepest of all the orbicularis fibres and the mucous membrane of the lips is firmly attached to them. They are only a thin sheet. The bulk of the orbicularis muscle is formed of extrinsic fibres; most of these come from the buccinator. The fibres of buccinator converge towards the modiolus. At the modiolus they form a chiasma; the uppermost and lowermost fibres pass straight on into their respective lips, while the middle fibres decussate, the upper fibres of buccinator passing into the lower lip, the lower into the upper lip.</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> By buccal and marginal mandibular branches of the facial nerve. It is damage to the latter branch (in the surgical approach to the submandibular gland) that causes an unsightly drooping of the corner of the mouth.</p><p><strong>Action.</strong> Contraction of the orbicularis oris causes a narrowing of the mouth, the lips becoming pursed up into the smallest possible circle (the whistling expression).</p><p><strong>Buccinator.</strong> Buccinator has a bony origin from both jaws opposite the molar teeth, and from the pterygomandibular raphe. Examine the vestibule of the mouth opposite the molars with tongue and finger. The buccinator arises just beyond the buccogingival fold; note its distance from the gum margin. Examine a skull and mark out the origin. Commencing at the anterior border of the first molar of the upper jaw, well away from the alveolar margin, the line passes horizontally backwards, skirting the root of the zygomatic process, and curves downwards to the tuberosity of the maxilla. Here there is a gap in the bony origin, the muscle arising from a fibrous band (sometimes called the pterygomaxillary ligament, and not to be confused with the pterygomandibular raphe) that extends from the tip of the hamulus to the nearest part of the tuberosity of the maxilla. Through the gap above this band passes the tendon of tensor palati as it hooks around the base of the hamulus (Fig. 6.11).</p><p>From the tip of the hamulus the pterygomandibular raphe extends to the mandible just above the posterior end of the mylohyoid line. The buccinator arises from the whole length of the raphe, along which it interdigitates with the fibres of the superior constrictor (p. 487); the raphe is passively elongated when the mouth is open. The mandibular attachment of the raphe is separated by a narrow interval from the posterior attachment of mylohyoid to the mylohyoid ridge; here the lingual nerve rests on the mandible, which, indeed, it often grooves (Fig. 6.26). The line of attachment of buccinator should now be traced behind the third molar (across the retromolar fossa) to the oblique line of the mandible; it then runs down just above this line as far forwards as the anterior border of the first molar. The muscle converges on the modiolus (p. 449), where its fibres of origin from the raphe decussate; the maxillary and mandibular fibres pass medially without decussation into the upper and lower lips respectively. The outer surface of the muscle is pierced by the parotid duct opposite the third upper molar tooth. The duct also passes through the buccal fat pad which lies on the outer surface of buccinator and is particularly prominent in infants, giving them their chubby cheeks. Beneath the fat lie the molar glands, four or five nodules each the size of a split pea. Their ducts pierce the muscle to open on the mucous membrane of the cheek (which lines the muscle&rsquo;s inner surface) opposite the third upper molar tooth.</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> By the buccal branches of the facial nerve. It belongs developmentally to the facial expression group, hence its nerve supply by this (second arch) nerve. Although filaments from the buccal branch of the mandibular nerve pierce the muscle to supply the oral mucous membrane overlying it, they are only proprioceptive as far as buccinator is concerned. Thus it is vitally important to distinguish between the buccal branches of the facial nerve which are the motor supply, and the buccal branch of the mandibular which is afferent only.</p><p><strong>Action.</strong> It is essentially an accessory muscle of mastication, being indispensable to the return of the bolus from the cheek pouch to the grinding mill of the molars. It is only a muscle of facial expression in so far as it belongs to the group supplied by the facial nerve, but it is equally important not to classify it as a proper muscle of mastication (like masseter, temporalis and the two pterygoids) which have their motor supply from the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve. Buccinator helps to keep food out of the vestibule of the mouth and in between the teeth; it does not move the jaw. When the cheeks are puffed out the muscle is relaxed. Only in forcible expulsion of air from the mouth, as in blowing a trumpet, are the elongated fibres of the puffed out cheeks under contraction. Otherwise contraction of the muscle obliterates the cavity of the vestibule and pulls the closed lips tightly back against the teeth.</p><h3 id=dilator-muscles-of-the-lips>Dilator Muscles of the Lips
<a class=anchor href=#dilator-muscles-of-the-lips>#</a></h3><p>Radiating from orbicularis oris like the spokes of a wheel is a series of dilator muscles, some inserted into the lips, some into the modiolus. All contracting together open the lips into the widest possible circle, an action that is usually accompanied by simultaneous opening of the jaws. Upper and lower lips have flat sheets of elevator and depressor muscles. Other muscles converge towards the angle of the mouth, where their decussating fibres build up, with the chiasma in the buccinator fibres, a knot of muscle known as the modiolus (Fig. 6.10). The intersecting fibres cannot slip through the modiolus, for at their crossing they are bound together by fibrous tissue. Thus the modiolus (and the angle of the mouth) can be moved about. The modiolus lies just lateral to the angle of the mouth, opposite the second upper premolar tooth. Its position and movements are of great importance in prosthetic dentistry. The individual dilator muscles are of little practical importance; only their chief features are summarized here.</p><p>Traced from the nose laterally a continuous sheet of elevator fibres comprises two separate muscles. Levator labii superioris alaeque nasi arises from the frontal process of the maxilla and is inserted into the alar cartilage and the upper lip; it elevates both. Levator labii superioris arises from the inferior orbital margin and is inserted into the remainder of the upper lip, which it elevates. The muscle overlies the exit of the infraorbital nerve. From the canine fossa below the infraorbital margin arises levator anguli oris; the infraorbital nerve lies sandwiched between it and the overlying levator labii superioris. The fibres of this muscle, deep to the superficial sheet of muscle, converge to the modiolus and pass through it to become superficial. They merge into the fibres of depressor anguli oris. Zygomaticus minor from the zygomaticomaxillary suture and zygomaticus major further out on the surface of the zygomatic bone converge to the modiolus. Risorius is a variable muscle, an upward extension from the platysma. It converges on the modiolus, with a gap above and below it exposing the facial artery and its companion vein. Depressor anguli oris arises from the oblique line of the mandible. It lies superficial; its fibres pass through the modiolus to the deeper stratum (levator anguli oris). Depressor labii inferioris arises deep to the former muscle. It is quadrangular in shape; its fibres are inserted into the lower lip. Mentalis is a muscle that arises from the symphysis menti near the midline of the mandible. Its fibres pass downwards through the depressor labii inferioris to reach the skin. It is an elevator of the skin of the chin (which it sometimes dimples) and thus of the centre of the lower lip and its contraction may disturb a lower denture.</p><h3 id=nerve-supply-of-face-muscles>Nerve Supply of Face Muscles
<a class=anchor href=#nerve-supply-of-face-muscles>#</a></h3><p>All the muscles thus far described receive their motor supply from the facial nerve. This nerve contains no sensory fibres on the face and proprioceptive impulses from the facial muscles are conveyed centrally by the trigeminal nerve, whose cutaneous branches intermingle freely on the face with branches of the facial nerve. A muscle supplied by the facial nerve receives its proprioceptive innervation from branches of the sensory nerve supplying the skin over the muscle. On the face itself branches of the trigeminal nerve provide the afferent innervation for all the muscles. That for platysma is supplied by the transverse cervical nerve, which lies beyond the cutaneous distribution of the trigeminal nerve.</p><p>The facial nerve emerges from the base of the skull through the stylomastoid foramen, near the origin of the posterior belly of digastric. It immediately gives off the posterior auricular nerve which passes upwards behind the ear to supply the occipital belly of occipitofrontalis. A muscular branch is next given off which divides to supply the posterior belly of digastric and stylohyoid. The nerve now approaches the posteromedial surface of the parotid gland. Just before entering the gland it divides into upper temporozygomatic and lower cervicofacial branches. Within the substance of the parotid gland each divides and rejoins to divide again and finally emerge from the parotid gland in five main groups of branches (Fig. 6.12). This plexiform arrangement, the pes anserinus, lies in the gland superficial to the retromandibular vein and the external carotid artery. Place the heel of the hand over the parotid gland, thumb on the temple, little finger down the neck. The five digits indicate the five branches of the nerve, or rather groups of branches, for the first three are usually multiple.</p><p>The temporal branches emerge from the upper border of the gland, cross the zygomatic arch, and supply auricularis anterior and superior, and part of frontalis. They are only important for wrinkling the forehead.</p><p>The zygomatic branches consist of upper and lower parts, which proceed above and below the eye. The upper branches supply frontalis and the upper half of orbicularis oculi. They cross the zygomatic arch and may be divided in incisions for operations on the temporal fossa, or injured in fractures of the zygomatic arch. The lower branches supply the lower half of orbicularis oculi and the muscles below the orbit. Two or three branches pass to both upper and lower lids. Paralysis prevents blinking, the precorneal film of tears is no longer spread, and the dry cornea ulcerates. The resultant scar impairs vision.</p><p>The buccal branches supply buccinator and the muscle fibres of the upper lip (i.e. orbicularis oris and the lower fibres of the elevators). Paralysis prevents emptying of the cheek pouch; the bolus lodges there and cannot be returned to the molar teeth. Chewing has to be performed on the other side.</p><p>The marginal mandibular branch supplies the muscles of the lower lip. It is important to remember that this nerve emerges from the lower border of the parotid gland and in 20% of cases passes into the neck below the angle of the mandible. It crosses the inferior border of the bone to reach the face beyond the anterior border of the masseter muscle, crossing the facial artery and vein. A small lymph node lies here and an incision of an abscess in the node can result in permanent paralysis of the lower lip. The nerve is in danger when an incision is made along the lower border of the mandible (p. 437).</p><p>The cervical branch passes vertically downwards from the lower border of the parotid gland behind the mandible and supplies platysma. The marginal mandibular branch occasionally arises from it below the parotid gland, a fact which apparently originated the erroneous though common statement that the muscles of the lower lip are supplied by the cervical branch of the facial nerve.</p><h3 id=cutaneous-nerve-supply-of-the-face>Cutaneous Nerve Supply of the Face
<a class=anchor href=#cutaneous-nerve-supply-of-the-face>#</a></h3><p>The skin of the face is supplied in three zones by branches of the three divisions of the trigeminal nerve. The three zones meet at the margins of the eyelids and the angles of the mouth; the lines of junction of the zones curve upwards. This arrangement is developmental. The areas of skin supplied by the three branches of the trigeminal nerve originally met each other along lines that extended horizontally back from the angles of the eye and mouth. The skin supplied by the mandibular nerve (the lowest branch of the trigeminal) lay over the mandible. The area now supplied by its auriculotemporal branch was first over the angle of the mandible. As the cranial cavity expands over the growing brain it draws face skin over it, so that beard skin is drawn up over the temple, and neck skin is drawn up to replace it. The temple is so named because, by its greying hairs, it is the first part to show the passage of time (&ldquo;Tempus fugit&rdquo;). The only part of the facial skin not supplied by any branch of the trigeminal nerve is that over the angle of the mandible and for some distance above and in front of it; this area is supplied by the great auricular nerve (p. 427).</p><p>The trigeminal nerve has three divisions (officially called branches) - ophthalmic, maxillary and mandibular (p. 43) - and each gives respectively five, three and three cutaneous branches, distributed as in Figure 6.13A. The pattern of a facial haemangioma (port wine stain, as in the Sturge-Weber syndrome), or of the skin rash of herpes zoster affecting the trigeminal ganglion, often affords an accurate demonstration of the area of skin supplied by one or more of the main branches of the nerve. In herpes the mandibular nerve is less often affected than the other two. Clinical observations indicate that, as far as pain fibres in the trigeminal nerve are concerned, the fibres are arranged in an onion skin pattern with respect to the cells of the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve with which they synapse (p. 631). The area round the mouth and lower part of the nose is supplied by fibres that synapse with cells in the highest (pontine) part of the spinal nucleus, followed by concentric areas, as in Figure 6.13B, whose fibres pass to progressively lower levels of the nucleus. It seems that the onion skin arrangement for pain does not correspond exactly to the sensory distribution of the main nerves (compare Figs 6.13A and B).</p><p><strong>Ophthalmic Division Branches.</strong> The lacrimal nerve supplies a small area of skin over the lateral part of the upper lid.</p><p>Towards the medial end of the upper margin of the orbit the supraorbital nerve indents the bone into a notch or a foramen. The nerve passes up, breaking into half a dozen or more branches which radiate out and supply the forehead and scalp up to the vertex.</p><p>The supratrochlear nerve passes up on the medial side of the supraorbital nerve through the frontal notch or foramen and divides to supply the middle of the forehead up to the hairline. Above this the supraorbital nerves meet in the midline up to the vertex.</p><p>The infratrochlear nerve supplies skin on the medial part of the upper lid and, passing above the medial palpebral ligament, descends along the side of the external nose, supplying skin over the bridge of the nose. It supplies no skin of the lower lid, which is second division territory.</p><p>These four branches of the ophthalmic nerve also supply upper lid conjunctiva.</p><p>The external nasal nerve supplies the middle of the external nose down to the tip. It emerges between the nasal bone and the upper nasal cartilage. In herpes zoster, involvement of this branch of the nasociliary nerve (p. 513) suggests that the cornea (supplied by the ciliary branches of the same nerve) may also become affected and lead to dangerous corneal ulceration.</p><p><strong>Maxillary Division Branches.</strong> The infraorbital nerve emerges through its foramen and lies between levator labii superioris and the deeper placed levator anguli oris. It is a large nerve that immediately breaks up into a tuft of branches; these radiate away from the foramen to supply palpebral branches to the lower eyelid and cheek, nasal branches to the side and ala of the nose, and labial branches to the upper lip and the labial gum from the midline to include the gum over the second premolar tooth. Many twigs join nearby branches of the facial nerve for the proprioceptive supply of adjacent face muscle.</p><p>The zygomaticofacial nerve emerges from a foramen on the outer surface of the zygomatic bone; its branches supply the overlying skin.</p><p>The zygomaticotemporal nerve emerges in the temporal fossa through a foramen in the temporal (posterior) surface of the zygomatic bone. It makes its way to the surface and supplies a small area of skin over the front of the temple on a level with the upper eyelid (i.e. the hairless part of the temple).</p><p><strong>Mandibular Division Branches.</strong> The auriculotemporal nerve passes around the neck of the mandible and ascends over the posterior root of the zygomatic arch behind the superficial temporal vessels. The auricular part of the nerve supplies the external acoustic meatus, surface of the tympanic membrane and skin of the auricle above this level. The temporal part supplies the hairy skin over the temple, that part in which grey hairs usually first appear.</p><p>The buccal nerve gives off cutaneous twigs before it pierces the buccinator muscle. They supply a thumbprint area over the cheek just below the zygomatic bone, between the areas of the infraorbital nerve and the great auricular nerve (p. 427).</p><p>The mental nerve is a cutaneous branch of the inferior alveolar nerve. Like the infraorbital nerve it breaks up into a tuft of branches that radiate away from the mental foramen to supply the skin and mucous membrane of the lower lip and labial gum from the midline to about the second premolar tooth.</p><h3 id=arterial-supply-of-the-face>Arterial Supply of the Face
<a class=anchor href=#arterial-supply-of-the-face>#</a></h3><p>The facial artery is the highest of the three branches that issue from the anterior aspect of the external carotid artery. It passes upwards on the side wall of the pharynx and hooks downwards over the posterior belly of digastric to come into contact with the upper surface of the submandibular gland (p. 436). It then hooks upwards over the inferior border of the mandible at the anterior border of the masseter muscle. It pursues a tortuous course towards the medial angle of the eye, lying deep to the sheet of dilator muscles that radiate out from the lips. It is visible only in the interval above and below the zygomatic and risorius muscles. Its labial branches are important; one for each lip, each superior and inferior labial artery divides into two, each of which runs across the lip beneath the red margin, one in front and the other behind. They anastomose end to end at the midline. The severed artery spurts from both ends. The temple is supplied by the superficial temporal artery, a terminal branch of the external carotid. At its beginning it gives off the transverse facial artery, which runs across the cheek just above the parotid duct. The forehead is supplied from the orbit by the supraorbital and supratrochlear branches of the ophthalmic artery. In the scalp these anastomose freely with the superficial temporal artery, establishing the only free communication between internal and external carotid systems.</p><h3 id=venous-drainage-of-the-face>Venous Drainage of the Face
<a class=anchor href=#venous-drainage-of-the-face>#</a></h3><p>The venous return from the face is normally entirely superficial. From the forehead the supraorbital and supratrochlear veins pass to the medial canthus, where they unite to form the angular vein. This becomes the facial vein which accompanies the facial artery to a point just below the border of the mandible. Here in the neck it pierces the investing layer of the deep fascia and is joined by the anterior branch of the retromandibular vein. (Formerly the part above the retromandibular union was called the anterior facial, and the part below it the common facial.) Blood from the temple is collected into the tributaries of the superficial temporal vein. The latter is joined by the maxillary veins from the pterygoid plexus to form the retromandibular vein. This passes downwards in the substance of the parotid gland and on emerging from its lower border divides into anterior and posterior branches. The anterior branch joins the facial vein which empties into the internal jugular. It often receives the superior thyroid vein and the vena comitans of the hypoglossal nerve. The posterior branch pierces the investing layer of deep cervical fascia and is joined by the posterior auricular vein to form the external jugular vein. This courses down in the subcutaneous tissue over sternocleidomastoid and pierces the investing layer of deep cervical fascia a finger&rsquo;s breadth above the midpoint of the clavicle, to empty into the subclavian vein; it has valves about 4 cm above the clavicle.</p><p>The facial vein communicates with the cavernous sinus (p. 564). At the medial canthus there is a communication with the ophthalmic veins, which drain directly into the sinus. Blood from the forehead normally flows via the facial vein; if the latter is blocked by pressure or thrombosis blood above the obstruction will flow through the orbit into the cavernous sinus. Hence the danger area of infection of the upper lip and nearby cheek. A further communication is the deep facial vein. This passes, in front of the masseter muscle, between the facial vein and the pterygoid plexus. The plexus receives a vein from the cavernous sinus through the foramen ovale or, if present, the venous foramen (of Vesalius), a small hole medial to the foramen ovale (p. 651). The danger area of the face lies between the angular and deep facial veins.</p><h2 id=lymph-drainage-of-the-face>Lymph Drainage of the Face
<a class=anchor href=#lymph-drainage-of-the-face>#</a></h2><p>The face drains into three superficial groups of nodes (p. 522) from three wedge-shaped blocks of tissue. Centrally the chin and tip of the tongue drain into submental nodes. A wedge of tissue above this drains to submandibular nodes; this wedge extends from central forehead and frontal sinuses through the anterior half of the nose and maxillary sinuses to the upper lip and lower part of the face, and includes the tongue and the floor of the mouth. Beyond the second wedge, forehead, temple, orbital contents and cheek drain to the preauricular group, and eventually all lymph reaches deep cervical nodes.</p><h2 id=scalp>Scalp
<a class=anchor href=#scalp>#</a></h2><p>The scalp extends from the eyebrows to the highest nuchal lines at the back of the skull and down to the ears and zygomatic arches at the sides. The forehead, from eyebrows to hairline (or where it should be if it has receded) is common to the face and scalp. The composition of the scalp is traditionally recalled from the five letters of the word which indicate its five layers - Skin, Connective tissue, Aponeurosis with muscle at the front and back, Loose areolar tissue and Pericranium.</p><p>The skin of the scalp is the thickest in the body, varying from 3-7 mm (body average 1-2 mm), and is thickest of all in the occipital region. Apart from being the hairiest part of the body it also contains a high concentration of sebaceous glands. Many of the fibres of the scalp muscle are inserted into it. Elsewhere it is firmly attached by dense connective tissue (the second layer) to the underlying muscle and aponeurosis. The blood vessels run within this firm tissue which unites the first and third layers. The tissue of the fourth layer is very loose, enabling the layers above to move over the pericranium, which is the name given to the periosteum of the vault of the skull. This is rather loosely attached to the bone and is easily stripped up by a subperiosteal haematoma. Such a haematoma outlines the bone concerned, since the pericranium is very firmly attached at the sutures.</p><h3 id=occipitofrontalis>Occipitofrontalis
<a class=anchor href=#occipitofrontalis>#</a></h3><p>Occipitofrontalis consists of occipitalis and frontalis muscular parts on each side and a central epicranial aponeurosis (galea aponeurotica) into which they are inserted at the back and front respectively. Occipitalis arises from the highest nuchal line and passes forwards into the aponeurosis which lies over the top of the skull. The aponeurosis fades out laterally by blending with the temporalis fascia just above the zygomatic arch. Frontalis arises from the front of the aponeurosis and passes forwards to become attached to the upper part of orbicularis oculi and the overlying skin of the eyebrow. The right and left frontalis muscles meet in the midline, but the two occipitalis muscles do not join one another. Note that only occipitalis has a bony attachment; frontalis runs between aponeurosis, muscle and skin but not bone.</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> By the facial nerve; the posterior auricular branch to occipitalis, and temporal and zygomatic branches to frontalis.</p><p><strong>Action.</strong> While occipitalis can pull the scalp back in certain individuals, usually it merely anchors the aponeurosis while frontalis elevates the eyebrows and produces wrinkles in the skin of the forehead. The scalp muscles are the opponents of the orbital part of orbicularis oculi; thus the scalp may be regarded as an upward prolongation of the face that extends back to the occiput.</p><p>Beneath the muscles and aponeurosis is a small amount of loose areolar tissue providing a plane above which the rest of the scalp can move and through which avulsion can occur (scalping). This so-called fourth layer really forms a subaponeurotic space, limited behind by the attachments of occipitalis to the nuchal lines and at the sides by the blending of the aponeurosis with the temporalis fascia. In front the space extends down beneath orbicularis oculi into the eyelids. Bleeding anywhere beneath the aponeurosis may appear as a black eye by the blood tracking down through the space.</p><h3 id=arterial-supply-of-the-scalp>Arterial Supply of the Scalp
<a class=anchor href=#arterial-supply-of-the-scalp>#</a></h3><p>The arteries of the scalp are derived from the external carotid artery by the occipital, posterior auricular and superficial temporal branches, and from the internal carotid artery by the supratrochlear and supraorbital branches. All these arteries anastomose very freely with each other. The junction of forehead and temple, above the outer end of the eyebrow, is the area where the external and internal carotid branches anastomose most freely with each other. The arteries are attached to the deepest layer of the dermis, and in a scalp wound they bleed profusely because the cut vessel ends remain held open. From the richly anastomosing skin arteries very few branches cross the subaponeurotic space to the underlying bones. Scalping does not cause necrosis of the bones of the vault, most of whose blood comes from the middle meningeal artery.</p><p>The occipital artery emerges from the apex of the posterior triangle and runs with the greater occipital nerve to supply the back of the scalp up to the vertex. The posterior auricular artery runs with the lesser occipital nerve to supply the scalp behind the ear.</p><p>The superficial temporal artery is a terminal branch of the external carotid. Running up behind the temporomandibular joint it crosses the posterior root of the zygomatic arch, where its pulsation can be felt above and in front of the tragus of the ear, and branches out widely into the skin that overlies the temporalis fascia. One branch, the middle temporal artery, pierces the fascia and runs up vertically deep to the muscle. Its companion vein produces a vertical groove on the squamous part of the temporal bone.</p><h3 id=venous-drainage-of-the-scalp>Venous Drainage of the Scalp
<a class=anchor href=#venous-drainage-of-the-scalp>#</a></h3><p>The supraorbital and supratrochlear veins drain by the angular vein into the facial vein. The superficial temporal veins run into the retromandibular vein, and occipital veins reach the plexus around the semispinalis capitis muscle. The posterior auricular vein drains the scalp behind the ear, and receives also the mastoid emissary vein from the sigmoid sinus. Infection here can be dangerous or fatal, from retrograde thrombosis of cerebellar and medullary veins.</p><h3 id=lymph-drainage-of-the-scalp>Lymph Drainage of the Scalp
<a class=anchor href=#lymph-drainage-of-the-scalp>#</a></h3><p>There are no lymph nodes within the scalp; lymphatic channels drain to nodes outside it - to occipital and posterior auricular nodes behind the ear, and to preauricular and (crossing the face) to submandibular nodes in front of the ear. The lymph eventually reaches the nodes of the deep cervical chain (p. 522).</p><h3 id=nerve-supply-of-the-scalp>Nerve Supply of the Scalp
<a class=anchor href=#nerve-supply-of-the-scalp>#</a></h3><p>The main sensory nerves run with the arteries. Posteriorly the greater occipital and third occipital nerves (posterior rami of C2 and C3 respectively) extend to the vertex and the posterior scalp respectively. The lesser occipital (anterior ramus of C2) supplies skin behind the ear. The temple is supplied by the auriculotemporal and the zygomaticotemporal nerves, and the forehead and front of the scalp by the supratrochlear and supraorbital nerves.</p><h2 id=temporal-fossa>Temporal Fossa
<a class=anchor href=#temporal-fossa>#</a></h2><p>Examine a skull. There are two temporal lines, superior and inferior. They diverge from a common origin at the border of the zygomatic process of the frontal bone, and sweep boldly up in a convexity that takes them back behind the ear. The area of bone between them is polished.</p><p>The temporal fossa is the area bounded by the temporal lines above and the zygomatic arch below. Its roof is the temporalis fascia and its floor is the part of the side of the skull that includes the important landmark called the pterion (p. 644). The zygomatic bone and the zygomatic processes of the frontal bone and maxilla are in the anterior wall, and the supramastoid crest continues the line of the upper margin of the arch backwards. The fossa is filled by the temporalis muscle which arises from the floor and the overlying fascia. Deep to the arch, at the level of the infratemporal crest of the greater wing of the sphenoid, the fossa becomes continuous with the lateral part of the infratemporal fossa (p. 457).</p><p>The zygomatic arch is formed by processes of the squamous temporal and zygomatic bones, which meet at a suture sloping downwards and backwards. The arch is completed anteriorly by the zygomatic process of the maxilla (p. 645).</p><p>Nerves crossing the arch are vulnerable in incisions or in fractures. The auriculotemporal nerve crosses well back, just in front of the ear, and temporal and zygomatic branches of the facial nerve also cross the arch, to reach frontalis and eyelid muscles.</p><p>The temporalis fascia is attached to the superior temporal line and passes down to the upper border of the zygomatic arch. It is a rugged membrane; the superficial temporal vessels and auriculotemporal nerve lie upon it, and it is perforated by the middle temporal artery and vein.</p><h3 id=temporalis>Temporalis
<a class=anchor href=#temporalis>#</a></h3><p>This muscle (one of the muscles of mastication - p. 455) arises from the temporal fossa over the whole area between the inferior temporal line and the infratemporal crest. The muscle is small in the newborn and rises up the side of the skull as the individual grows. The most anterior fibres are vertical and the most posterior are horizontal, turning downwards over the root of the zygomatic arch. The large fan-shaped muscle converges towards the coronoid process of the mandible, and its muscle fibres become tendinous. The insertion begins at the deepest part of the mandibular notch and climbs over the coronoid process on to the front of the ramus. Very little of the tendon is inserted beyond the border of the coronoid process into the outer plate of the mandible: the main insertion is into the bevelled surface on the inner plate of the bone, at the posterior border of the coronoid process and at the anterior border down the ascending ramus as far as the attachment of the buccinator in the retromolar fossa (Figs 6.14 and 8.14, p. 664).</p><p>The blood supply of the muscle is derived from the temporal branches of the maxillary artery, reinforced by the middle temporal artery (p. 459).</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> By the two deep temporal branches of the mandibular nerve, sometimes reinforced by a middle temporal nerve.</p><p><strong>Action.</strong> Its upper and anterior fibres elevate the mandible (close the jaws); its posterior fibres, sweeping over the root of the zygoma, retract the mandible. They are the only fibres to do so; no other muscle retracts the condyle.</p><h2 id=parotid-region>Parotid Region
<a class=anchor href=#parotid-region>#</a></h2><p>The part of the face below and in front of the ear and below the zygomatic arch is the parotid region. The principal features are the parotid gland and the masseter muscle (one of the mastication group; the others are temporalis, p. 454, and the two pterygoids, p. 457).</p><h3 id=masseter>Masseter
<a class=anchor href=#masseter>#</a></h3><p>This muscle arises from the zygomatic arch. Its commonly described two heads are, in fact, three, though they are fused together on the arch (Fig. 6.14). At their insertions on the mandibular ramus the three sets are fused anteriorly, but diverge from each other posteriorly for the passage of the masseteric nerve and artery. The superficial part of the muscle is the largest. It arises from the anterior two-thirds of the lower border of the zygomatic arch as far forward as the zygomatic process of the maxilla. Its fibres slope down at 45° and are inserted into a wide area: from the angle of the mandible forwards along the lower border, and upwards to include the lower part of the ramus.</p><p>The upper part of the muscle is covered in aponeurotic fibres (to slide on the parotid duct and the accessory parotid gland), the lower half is fleshy. The intermediate part of the muscle arises from the middle third of the arch and the deep part from the deep surface of the arch in continuity. The fibres pass vertically downwards to be inserted into the ramus of the mandible. Their insertions fuse with each other and with the superficial fibres at the anterior border of the ramus, but are separate posteriorly. The masseteric nerve runs down between the deep and intermediate parts, and a branch from the superficial temporal or transverse facial artery runs forwards between the superficial and intermediate parts. Nerve and artery thus incompletely divide the muscle into three parts (Fig. 6.14). The artery is the chief source of supply to the muscle; the vessel accompanying the masseteric nerve is very small.</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> By the masseteric branch from the anterior division of the mandibular nerve (p. 461).</p><p><strong>Action.</strong> To close the jaws by elevating and drawing forwards the angle of the mandible.</p><h3 id=parotid-gland>Parotid Gland
<a class=anchor href=#parotid-gland>#</a></h3><p>The parotid gland is predominantly a serous salivary gland, with only a few scattered mucous acini. It has an irregular shape because it fills in the gap between the mastoid process, ramus of the mandible and styloid process, spilling over in variable degrees on to the muscles attached to these bones (Figs 6.2 and 6.9). It is best described as having upper and lower poles and three surfaces that are most logically called lateral, anterior and deep. It is surrounded by a tough capsule, the parotid sheath, derived from the investing layer of deep cervical fascia. Mumps, a virus infection of the gland, is painful because the gland swells within this tight fibrous envelope.</p><p>The upper pole is a small concave surface that adheres to the cartilage of the external acoustic meatus and lies adjacent to the capsule of the temporomandibular joint. The lower pole is rounded, lying below and behind the angle of the mandible and indented by it and sternocleidomastoid, and overlapping the posterior belly of digastric.</p><p>The lateral surface is subcutaneous and almost flat. The anterior surface (often called anteromedial) is U-shaped, clasping the ramus of the mandible with masseter on its outer surface and the medial pterygoid on its inner surface inferiorly. The stylomandibular ligament separates this surface from the medial pterygoid and from the posterior part of the submandibular gland. The outer edge of this surface meets the lateral surface over masseter to form the convex anterior border, deep to which emerge the parotid duct and the five (groups of) branches of the facial nerve that fan out over the face. From the deeper part of this surface the terminal branches of the external carotid artery (superficial temporal and maxillary) leave the gland.</p><p>The deep surface (often called posteromedial) is the most irregular and complicated. It is indented by the mastoid process and its attached muscles (sternocleidomastoid laterally and the posterior belly of digastric medially), and lies against the styloid process with its three attached muscles (stylohyoid, styloglossus and stylopharyngeus) and two ligaments (stylohyoid and stylomandibular). The external carotid artery enters the gland through the lower part of this surface, which joins the deep edge of the anterior surface. If the gland is large this edge extends forwards in front of the styloid process to approach the superior constrictor of the pharynx. The styloid process separates the gland from the internal jugular vein and (deeper) the internal carotid artery. The temporozygomatic and cervicofacial branches of the facial nerve enter the gland between the styloid and mastoid processes. If the gland is retracted forwards from sternocleidomastoid and the acoustic meatus (as during parotidectomy), a small arrow-like projection of the meatal cartilage conveniently points downwards towards the nerve.</p><p>Embedded within the gland are the facial nerve, retromandibular vein and external carotid artery, in that order from superficial to deep. Although the facial nerve enters the deep surface it passes forwards to become the most superficial of the embedded structures, as approached from the superficial surface. Note that the branches of the nerve emerge from behind the anterior border, not from the lateral surface. The gland is often described as having superficial and deep parts in relation to the nerve branches, as though during development the nerve had become enclosed in a sandwich of two layers of parotid tissue, but this is not a correct concept. Immediately deep to the plane of the nerve branches is the retromandibular vein, which can be a guide to the position of the nerves; follow the tributaries of the external jugular vein upwards into the gland, and the nerves will be found immediately superficial to the veins. The external carotid artery and its two terminal branches are the deepest of the large structures within the gland. Lymph nodes of the preauricular group may be within the gland substance as well as just inside the capsule, and the gland is penetrated by filaments of the auriculotemporal nerve which provide the secretomotor fibres.</p><p>The parotid duct (of Stensen), 5 cm long, passes forwards across the masseter and turns around its anterior border to pierce the buccinator. It lies in the line between the intertragic notch of the auricle and the midpoint of the philtrum and is palpable (feel it on yourself as it passes over the clenched masseter muscle). The duct opens on the mucous membrane of the cheek opposite the second upper molar tooth; it pierces the buccinator further back and runs forwards beneath the mucous membrane to its orifice - the valvular flap of mucous membrane so produced prevents inflation of the gland when intraoral pressure is raised.</p><p>An accessory parotid gland usually lies on the masseter between the duct and the zygomatic arch. Several ducts open from it into the parotid duct. It and the duct lie on the tendinous part of the surface of the masseter muscle.</p><h3 id=blood-supply-3>Blood Supply

<a class=anchor href=#nerve-supply-2>#</a></h3><p>Secretomotor fibres arise from cell bodies in the otic ganglion (p. 35) and reach the gland by hitchhiking along the auriculotemporal nerve. The preganglionic fibres arise from cell bodies in the inferior salivary nucleus in the medulla, and travel by way of the glossopharyngeal nerve, its tympanic branch, the tympanic plexus and the lesser petrosal nerve to the otic ganglion. Sympathetic (vasoconstrictor) fibres reach the gland from the superior cervical ganglion by way of the plexus on the external carotid and middle meningeal arteries. The gland itself receives sensory fibres from the auriculotemporal nerve, but the parotid fascia receives its sensory innervation from the great auricular nerve (C2).</p><h3 id=structure-3>Structure
<a class=anchor href=#structure-3>#</a></h3><p>Histological sections of the parotid gland are characterized by three features that distinguish it from the other main salivary glands: predominantly serous acini, many ducts, and fat cells scattered between the acini and ducts. Compare these features with the submandibular gland, which has a mixture of serous and mucous acini (including mucous acini with serous demilunes at their periphery), and few ducts, and the sublingual gland which has almost exclusively mucous acini and few ducts.</p><h3 id=development-3>Development
<a class=anchor href=#development-3>#</a></h3><p>A groove that appears in the cheek (ectoderm) becomes converted into a tunnel from the blind end of which cells proliferate to form the gland.</p><h3 id=surgical-approach-3>Surgical Approach
<a class=anchor href=#surgical-approach-3>#</a></h3><p>Removal of the parotid gland (parotidectomy) is an exercise in dissection of the facial nerve. An S-shaped incision is made from in front of the ear, backwards to the mastoid process and then downwards and forwards below the angle of the mandible. The skin incision includes platysma. The gland is retracted forwards from sternocleidomastoid to expose the posterior belly of digastric and stylohyoid and the cartilage of the external meatus. The trunk of the facial nerve is approached along a plane in front of the anterior margin of the cartilage, above stylohyoid and digastric. The stylomastoid branch of the posterior auricular artery is slightly more superficial than the facial nerve and is a guide to its proximity. The cartilage in this region has a slight arrow-headed projection that conveniently points towards the nerve, which can be followed forward from here along its various branches as gland tissue is dissected away. The parotid duct is divided at the anterior border of the masseter. For total as distinct from superficial parotidectomy (which has been described so far), further tissue is dissected away with ligation of the external carotid, superficial temporal and maxillary arteries and adjacent veins. The styloid process may have to be fractured and the stylomandibular ligament divided.</p><h2 id=infratemporal-fossa>Infratemporal Fossa
<a class=anchor href=#infratemporal-fossa>#</a></h2><p>This is a space lying beneath the base of the skull between the side wall of the pharynx and the ramus of the mandible.</p><h3 id=boundaries>Boundaries
<a class=anchor href=#boundaries>#</a></h3><p>Its medial boundary is the lateral surface of the lateral pterygoid plate with, behind it, the tensor and levator palati muscles and the superior constrictor. In front of the lateral pterygoid plate, between it and the maxilla, is the pterygomaxillary fissure through which the infratemporal fossa communicates with the pterygopalatine fossa (p. 466). The lateral wall is the ramus of the mandible and its coronoid process. The anterior wall is the posterior (infratemporal) surface of the maxilla, which contains small foramina for the posterior superior alveolar nerves and vessels. At the upper margin of this wall of the maxilla there is a gap between it and the greater wing of sphenoid - the inferior orbital fissure. The roof of the fossa is formed medially by the infratemporal surface of the greater wing of the sphenoid and the adjacent squamous part of the temporal bone in front of the articular tubercle. This infratemporal surface of the sphenoid is bounded laterally by the infratemporal crest, where the bone takes an almost right-angled turn upwards to become part of the side of the skull, deep to the zygomatic arch and part of the temporal fossa (p. 454). Thus the roof of the infratemporal fossa lateral to the infratemporal crest is not bony, but is the space deep to the zygomatic arch where the temporal and infratemporal fossae communicate. The posterior boundary is the upper part of the carotid sheath (p. 462).</p><h3 id=contents-1>Contents
<a class=anchor href=#contents-1>#</a></h3><p>The fossa contains the medial and lateral pterygoid muscles and intervening fat; the insertion of temporalis into the coronoid process; the maxillary artery and branches and the pterygoid venous plexus; the mandibular nerve and its branches together with the otic ganglion and the chorda tympani; and the posterior superior alveolar branches of the maxillary nerve.</p><h3 id=lateral-pterygoid>Lateral Pterygoid
<a class=anchor href=#lateral-pterygoid>#</a></h3><p>This muscle arises by two heads: the upper from the infratemporal surface of the skull (see above) and the lower from the lateral surface of the lateral pterygoid plate (Fig. 6.15). The two heads, lying edge to edge, converge and fuse into a short thick tendon that is inserted into the pterygoid fovea (beneath the medial end of the mandibular head). The upper fibres of the tendon, lying above this pit, pass back into the articular disc of the temporomandibular joint, and into the anterior part of the capsule.</p><h3 id=medial-pterygoid>Medial Pterygoid
<a class=anchor href=#medial-pterygoid>#</a></h3><p>This muscle also arises by two heads. The deep head is by far the larger and comes from the medial (deep) surface of the lateral pterygoid plate and the depths of the fossa between the two plates. (Note that the medial pterygoid plate has the pharynx attached to its posterior border and thus forms the posterior part of the lateral wall of the nose, while the lateral pterygoid plate lies sandwiched between the two pterygoid muscles.) The bulky muscle diverges down from the lateral pterygoid muscle at nearly a right angle from their common origin beside the lateral pterygoid plate (Fig. 6.15). A small band of muscle, the superficial head, arises from the tuberosity of the maxilla and the pyramidal process of the palatine bone and, passing over the lower margin of the lateral pterygoid muscle, fuses with the main muscle mass. In this way the two heads, very unequal in size, embrace the lower edge of the lateral pterygoid. The broad band of muscle passes down and back at 45° (and laterally) to reach the angle of the mandible. It is inserted from the border of the angle over the rough area seen on the bone as far as the groove for the mylohyoid vessels and nerve. The nerve runs in the narrow angle between the muscle and the mandible (Figs 6.15 and 8.14, p. 664).</p><p><strong>Action.</strong> The pull of the muscle on the angle of the mandible is upwards and forwards and medially (i.e. it closes the mouth and moves the mandible towards the opposite side). It is the great chewing muscle for the molar teeth and is particularly developed in the chewing mammals, especially the ruminants, which chew and rechew the cud (p. 524). Contracting with its opposite fellow and the two lateral pterygoids, it helps to protrude the mandible.</p><h3 id=maxillary-artery>Maxillary Artery
<a class=anchor href=#maxillary-artery>#</a></h3><p>The maxillary artery is, with the superficial temporal artery, a terminal division of the external carotid. It enters the infratemporal fossa by winding around deep to the neck of the mandible and passing forwards between the neck of the mandible and the sphenomandibular ligament. Here the auriculotemporal nerve lies above it, and the maxillary veins below it. It usually runs deep to the lower head and passes forward between the two heads of the lateral pterygoid muscle (Fig. 6.15) but, like vascular patterns elsewhere, variation is common and the artery may pass below (or, more rarely, above) the muscle. In any case it passes deeply into the pterygomaxillary fissure and so into the pterygopalatine fossa.</p><p>It is described conventionally in three parts, before, on and beyond the lateral pterygoid muscle and this is useful, since five branches come from each part. From first and third parts the five branches all enter foramina in bones, from the second part none go through foramina in bones.</p><p>The five (&ldquo;bony&rdquo;) branches from the first part are the inferior alveolar, middle meningeal, accessory meningeal and, to complete the five, two branches to the ear. The first two are the most important; in dissections note that they arise very near one another and pass respectively straight down and straight up.</p><p><strong>Inferior Alveolar Artery.</strong> The inferior alveolar artery passes downwards and forwards (vein behind it) towards the inferior alveolar nerve, which it meets at the mandibular foramen, in which all three lie. It passes forwards in the mandible, supplying the pulps of the mandibular teeth (dental branches) and the body of the mandible. Its mental branch emerges from the mental foramen and supplies the nearby lip and skin. In the edentulous mandible of old age where alveolar bone has become resorbed the artery atrophies.</p><p><strong>Middle Meningeal Artery.</strong> The middle meningeal artery passes vertically upwards to the foramen spinosum. It is embraced by the two roots of the auriculotemporal nerve. It supplies bone of the skull (p. 562). From the sympathetic plexus on the artery a branch peels off to enter the otic ganglion.</p><p><strong>Accessory Meningeal Artery.</strong> The accessory meningeal artery passes upwards through the foramen ovale and supplies the dura mater of the floor of the middle fossa and of the trigeminal (Meckel&rsquo;s) cave. It is the chief source of blood supply to the trigeminal ganglion.</p><p>The remaining two arteries pass upwards to enter the ear by running superficial and deep to the tympanic membrane. The deep auricular artery is the more superficial of the two and supplies the external acoustic meatus, passing between the cartilage and bone. The deeper is the anterior tympanic artery which passes through the petrotympanic fissure to the middle ear to join the circular anastomosis around the tympanic membrane.</p><p>The second part of the maxillary artery gives off branches to the pterygoid muscles and deep temporal branches to temporalis. Further branches accompany the lingual and buccal nerves. Together they can be summarized as five in number to the soft parts.</p><p>The third part of the maxillary artery, in the pterygopalatine fossa, gives five branches which accompany nerves including branches of the pterygopalatine ganglion (p. 468). The artery then leaves the fossa through the sphenopalatine foramen, changing its name to the sphenopalatine artery and becoming the main artery of the nasal cavity (p. 472).</p><p><strong>Posterior Superior Alveolar Artery.</strong> The posterior superior alveolar artery gives branches that accompany the corresponding nerves through foramina in the posterior wall of the maxilla. The greater palatine artery enters the foramen of the same name to reach the hard palate (p. 480). The very small pharyngeal artery enters the palatovaginal canal, and the artery of the pterygoid canal runs into its own canal. The infraorbital artery passes forwards through the inferior orbital fissure, along the floor of the orbit and infraorbital canal to emerge with the infraorbital nerve on the face.</p><h3 id=posterior-superior-alveolar-nerve>Posterior Superior Alveolar Nerve
<a class=anchor href=#posterior-superior-alveolar-nerve>#</a></h3><p>The posterior superior alveolar nerve is a branch of the maxillary, given off in the pterygopalatine fossa and soon dividing into two or three dental branches which pierce the posterior wall of the maxilla separately; their foramina can usually be seen in the dried skull. They are distributed to the molar teeth and the mucous membrane of the maxillary sinus. Another (gingival) branch does not pierce the bone but runs along the alveolar margin of the maxilla as far forward as the first molar tooth, to supply the gingiva of the vestibule alongside the molar teeth. (The adjacent mucous membrane of the cheek that lines the buccinator is supplied by the buccal branch of the mandibular nerve.) The mucous membrane of the vestibule of the mouth is reflected at the lateral part of the anterior wall of the infratemporal fossa and the posterior superior alveolar nerves can be blocked by injection here. Around the tip of the injecting needle lie the vessels mentioned above and the pterygoid venous plexus (see below). They can be punctured, with a consequent haematoma of some size.</p><h3 id=pterygoid-plexus>Pterygoid Plexus
<a class=anchor href=#pterygoid-plexus>#</a></h3><p>The pterygoid plexus is a network of very small veins that lie around and within the lateral pterygoid muscle. It is frequently not demonstrable in the dissected cadaver (because it lies within the muscle); sometimes it appears as a knot of veins on the lateral surface of the lower head of the muscle. In the living it is often very full, and can easily be punctured by the needle delivering an anaesthetic solution in the region of the posterior superior alveolar nerves. The veins draining into the pterygoid plexus correspond with the branches of the maxillary artery, but they do not return all the arterial blood, much of which returns from the periphery of the area by other routes (facial veins, pharyngeal veins, diploic veins). On the other hand the pterygoid plexus receives the drainage of the inferior ophthalmic veins (p. 514) via the inferior orbital fissure (blood from the internal carotid artery) and the deep facial vein (p. 452). The pterygoid plexus drains into a pair of large, but very short, maxillary veins which lie deep to the neck of the mandible. They run back and join the superficial temporal vein to form the retromandibular vein. The deep facial vein provides an alternative pathway, via the facial vein, for drainage of the pterygoid plexus if the maxillary vein is temporarily occluded by local pressures from outside or from the mandible in certain movements, or in the reverse way for drainage of the angular vein if the lower part of the facial vein is occluded by pressure.</p><p>The role of the pterygoid plexus is to act as a peripheral heart, aiding venous return by the pumping action of the lateral pterygoid muscle. The plexus is valved and sucks blood from incompressible parts (face bones, orbit) and pumps it back into the maxillary veins. It pumps each time the mouth is actively opened (talking or chewing or both) but not when the mandible droops by gravity (e.g. in sleep). The prolonged and forcible contraction of the lateral pterygoid muscle to open the mouth in yawning is accompanied by a like contraction of the diaphragm to aid venous return from the abdomen, and often also by stretching of the limbs to empty them of stagnant venous blood. Observe a cat or a human awakening from a sleep so deep that the muscles have been very relaxed. Thus it is possible that, at least in some instances, yawning is a purposive reflex triggered off by venous stagnation, but the phenomenon has not been fully explained.</p><h3 id=sphenomandibular-ligament>Sphenomandibular Ligament
<a class=anchor href=#sphenomandibular-ligament>#</a></h3><p>The sphenomandibular ligament is a flat band of tough fibrous tissue extending from a narrow attachment on the spine of the sphenoid. It broadens as it passes downwards to be attached to the lingula and inferior margin of the mandibular foramen. It is the perichondrium of Meckel&rsquo;s cartilage (Fig. 1.30, p. 38). Between it and the neck of the mandible pass the auriculotemporal nerve and the maxillary artery and vein. Between it and the ramus of the mandible the inferior alveolar vessels and nerve converge to the mandibular foramen. It is pierced by the mylohyoid nerve which, branching from the inferior alveolar nerve, lies in the groove on the mandible at the margin of attachment of the medial pterygoid muscle (Fig. 8.14, p. 664). The mylohyoid artery, a similar branch of the inferior alveolar artery, is very small and accompanies the nerve to anastomose with the submental branch of the facial artery. The small vein accompanying the mylohyoid artery is actually responsible for making the mylohyoid groove on the mandible.</p><h3 id=mandibular-nerve>Mandibular Nerve
<a class=anchor href=#mandibular-nerve>#</a></h3><p>The mandibular branch from the trigeminal ganglion lies in the dura mater of the middle cranial fossa lateral to the cavernous sinus. With the motor root of the trigeminal nerve it enters the foramen ovale, where the two join and emerge as the mandibular nerve (like spinal nerve roots in intervertebral foramina). The nerve lies deep to the upper (infratemporal) head of the lateral pterygoid, on the tensor palati muscle, with the otic ganglion applied to the deep surface of the nerve. This point is 4 cm deep to the articular tubercle through the mandibular notch. After a short course the nerve divides into a small anterior (mainly motor) and a large posterior (mainly sensory) branch.</p><p><strong>Branches from the Main Trunk.</strong> One sensory and one motor: The meningeal branch or nervus spinosus, re-enters the middle cranial fossa via the foramen spinosum, or more usually the foramen ovale, supplying the meninges of the posterior half of the middle cranial fossa, and the mastoid antrum and air cells through the petrosquamous suture. It gives twigs to the cartilaginous part of the auditory tube before entering the skull.</p><p>The nerve to the medial pterygoid runs forwards to the muscle, and gives off the motor root to the otic ganglion (see below). This root passes near or through the ganglion without synapse and its fibres supply the two tensor muscles, tensor palati and tensor tympani. Do not confuse this miscalled motor root with the secretomotor root of the ganglion, which is the lesser petrosal nerve (p. 35).</p><p><strong>Branches from the Anterior Division.</strong> This division is motor, except for one branch (the buccal nerve).</p><p>Deep temporal branches to temporalis pass above the upper border of the lateral pterygoid muscle. Two in number, anterior and posterior, they are sometimes joined by a third, the middle, which comes out, with the buccal nerve, between the two heads of the lateral pterygoid. The nerves run up into the temporal fossa deep to temporalis.</p><p>The masseteric nerve, passing above the upper border of the lateral pterygoid, emerges through the mandibular notch to enter the deep surface of the masseter (Fig. 6.14). It gives an articular branch to the temporomandibular joint (Hilton&rsquo;s law).</p><p>The nerve to the lateral pterygoid runs with the buccal nerve and supplies both heads of the muscle.</p><p>The buccal nerve, wholly sensory, contains all the fibres of common sensation in the anterior division of the mandibular nerve. It emerges between the two heads of the lateral pterygoid (Fig. 6.15) and courses downwards and forwards in a fascial tunnel on the deep surface of temporalis. It runs on the buccinator, giving branches to the skin over the cheek, then pierces the buccinator (giving proprioceptive fibres to it) and supplies the mucous membrane of the cheek and the gum of the lower jaw opposite the lower molars and second premolar (i.e. up to the mental foramen).</p><p><strong>Branches from the Posterior Division.</strong> This division is sensory except for the motor fibres which are distributed via the mylohyoid nerve. There are three branches.</p><p>The auriculotemporal nerve is derived by two roots from the posterior division; they embrace the middle meningeal artery. The nerve passes backwards between the neck of the mandible and the sphenomandibular ligament, lying above the maxillary vessels, deep to the parotid gland. It gives a branch to the temporomandibular joint, and ascends over the posterior root of the zygomatic arch behind the superficial temporal vessels (Fig. 6.9). The auricular part innervates the skin of the tragus and upper part of the pinna, the external acoustic meatus and the outer surface of the tympanic membrane. The temporal part is distributed to the skin of the temple over that part which first turns grey (this area is really skin borrowed from the beard, pulled up towards the vertex as the skull enlarges to accommodate the brain; its former site over the angle of the jaw is replaced by the great auricular - C2). The auriculotemporal nerve also supplies the parotid gland, and carries to it the postganglionic secretomotor fibres from the otic ganglion (Fig. 1.25, p. 34). Note that the nerve does not supply the parotid fascia, whose deep and superficial laminae are supplied by the great auricular nerve.</p><p>The inferior alveolar nerve emerges below the lower head of the lateral pterygoid and curves down on the medial pterygoid (Fig. 6.15). The nerve lies anterior to its vessels between the sphenomandibular ligament and the ramus of the mandible, and enters the mandibular foramen. It is into this region, just above the foramen, that anaesthetic solution is introduced for inferior alveolar nerve block (p. 478). The mylohyoid nerve leaves the inferior alveolar at the foramen. It pierces the sphenomandibular ligament, lies on the mandible above the insertion of the medial pterygoid (Fig. 6.26A) and runs forward on the superficial (cervical) surface of the mylohyoid, supplying it and the anterior belly of the digastric.</p><p>The inferior alveolar nerve runs with its vessels in the mandibular canal. It supplies the three molar and two premolar teeth. Then it divides into the mental nerve (p. 452) and the incisive nerve. This nerve supplies the pulps and periodontal membranes of the canine and both incisors, with some overlap into the opposite central incisor.</p><p>The lingual nerve appears below the lateral pterygoid on the side wall of the pharynx and passes forwards and downwards between the medial pterygoid and the mandible (Fig. 6.15). It then comes into contact with the mandible, sometimes leaving a groove below and medial to the third molar, just above the posterior end of the mylohyoid line (Fig. 6.26). This groove separates the attachments of the pterygomandibular raphe above and mylohyoid muscle below (Fig. 8.14, p. 664). The nerve thus enters the mouth on the surface of the mylohyoid, beneath the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth. The chorda tympani (from the facial nerve, p. 530) emerges through the petrotympanic fissure, grooves the spine of the sphenoid, and joins the lingual nerve 2 cm below the base of the skull and is distributed with it to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. It carries all the parasympathetic secretomotor fibres to the submandibular ganglion and all the taste fibres from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue (p. 483).</p><h3 id=otic-ganglion>Otic Ganglion
<a class=anchor href=#otic-ganglion>#</a></h3><p>This small body lies between the tensor palati and the mandibular nerve, just below the foramen ovale. It is about 2-3 mm in diameter and is not a round pea-like structure as often depicted in drawings, but flat and closely applied to the nerve. It is a relay station for parasympathetic secretomotor fibres to the parotid gland; the lesser petrosal branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve brings these fibres. A branch from the nerve to the medial pterygoid passes through the ganglion to the tensor muscles (tympani and palati). The connections of the otic ganglion are given on page 34 (Fig. 1.25).</p><h2 id=upper-carotid-sheath>Upper Carotid Sheath
<a class=anchor href=#upper-carotid-sheath>#</a></h2><p>In contact with the prevertebral fascia the carotid sheath lies on the side wall of the pharynx. Lateral to it the three muscles of the styloid apparatus slope down.</p><p>The carotid sheath extends from the arch of the aorta to the base of the skull (p. 650). In its upper part it is attached to the margins of the carotid canal in the petrous bone and to the inferior border of the tympanic part of the temporal bone where it blends with the deep layer of the parotid fascia (p. 423). It contains here the internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein (p. 438) and the last four (ninth to twelfth) cranial nerves. Medial to it lies the pharynx; laterally the deepest part of the parotid gland touches the sheath and above this the styloid process and its three muscles slope downwards and forwards. Anteriorly is the infratemporal fossa, of which the carotid sheath may be said to form the posterior boundary. Behind the carotid sheath lies the cervical sympathetic trunk on the prevertebral fascia.</p><p>Examine a skull. The carotid canal lies immediately in front of the jugular foramen (which lies deep to the external acoustic meatus) with the hypoglossal canal more medially between them. The internal jugular vein lies behind the internal carotid artery at the base of the skull, but slopes as it descends, and at a lower level lies lateral to the common carotid artery as the vessels lie on scalenus anterior. At all levels the vagus nerve lies deep in the groove between the two, bound in the carotid sheath. The glossopharyngeal and accessory nerves emerge at the base of the skull between artery and vein and immediately curve away from each other superficial to the vessels (Fig. 6.16). The hypoglossal nerve emerges from the hypoglossal canal medial to the sheath. It passes through the sheath by curling down behind the inferior vagal ganglion and turning forwards to emerge between the artery and vein. Throughout its course to the tongue it has arteries deep and veins superficial to it.</p><p>While the internal carotid artery enters the skull (hence its name), the external carotid does not reach the base of the skull, having divided into its terminal branches within the parotid gland. To help sort out the relationships below the skull of these vessels (and the internal jugular vein) with the last four cranial nerves, study Figure 6.16 while noting the following. The common carotid artery divides like a two-pronged fork. Passing between the prongs, i.e. between the internal and external carotids, are: the styloid process and its continuation the stylohyoid ligament, styloglossus, stylopharyngeus, the glossopharyngeal nerve with its branch to stylopharyngeus and its pharyngeal branch, and the pharyngeal branch of the vagus (and also if present the track of a branchial fistula). Stylohyoid (with the posterior belly of digastric, not shown in this figure) passes superficial to the external carotid, and so at a lower level does the hypoglossal nerve. Passing deep to both carotids is the superior laryngeal nerve and its two branches, the internal and external laryngeals. It is perhaps an aid to memory to say that pharyngeal structures (with an &lsquo;f&rsquo; sound) pass through the carotid fork - stylopharyngeus, the glossopharyngeal nerve, the pharyngeal branches of it and the vagus, and the branchial fistula track.</p><h3 id=glossopharyngeal-nerve>Glossopharyngeal Nerve
<a class=anchor href=#glossopharyngeal-nerve>#</a></h3><p>The glossopharyngeal nerve, the nerve of the third pharyngeal arch (p. 38), emerges from the anterior part of the jugular foramen on the lateral side of the inferior petrosal sinus (p. 567). It makes a deep notch in the inferior border of the petrous bone and here its inferior ganglion bulges the nerve. (The smaller superior ganglion is simply the detached upper part of the inferior.) The ganglion contains the cell bodies of most sensory fibres in the nerve. The nerve passes down on the internal carotid artery and curves forward around the lateral side of stylopharyngeus (Fig. 6.30). Passing now parallel with the lower border of styloglossus, below the lower border of the superior constrictor.</p><p>Its six branches are as follows:</p><p><strong>Tympanic Branch (Jacobson&rsquo;s Nerve).</strong> This leaves the nerve at the inferior ganglion and passes through the tympanic canaliculus on the ridge of petrous bone between the carotid and jugular foramina to supply the middle ear, mastoid air cells and bony part of the auditory tube with sensory fibres. In this branch are also parasympathetic fibres from the inferior salivary nucleus. They run through the tympanic plexus on the promontory, leave the middle ear in the lesser petrosal nerve (p. 530) and so pass to relay in the otic ganglion (Fig. 6.18) for the secretomotor supply of the parotid gland and the other small glands of the vestibule of the mouth.</p><p><strong>Motor Branch to Stylopharyngeus.</strong> This is given off as the nerve spirals around the posterior border of that muscle. The cell bodies of the motor axons lie in the nucleus ambiguus.</p><p><strong>Carotid Sinus Nerve.</strong> This is the main supply to the carotid sinus and carotid body (baroreceptors and chemoreceptors, p. 438). This small nerve, rarely displayed in the average dissected specimen, is of great importance in view of its connections via the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (p. 610) with the vasomotor and other autonomic centers in the reticular formation of the brainstem.</p><p><strong>Pharyngeal Branches.</strong> One or more pharyngeal branches join the pharyngeal plexus on the middle constrictor muscle. They pierce the muscle and supply the mucous membrane of the oropharynx with common sensation and (a few) taste fibres and with parasympathetic fibres from the inferior salivary nucleus to the mucous and serous glands of the oropharynx (these fibres relay in small ganglia in the mucous membrane of the pharynx).</p><p><strong>Tonsillar Branch.</strong> This supplies the mucous membrane over part of the (palatine) tonsil, anastomosing with lesser palatine nerves.</p><p><strong>Lingual Branch.</strong> This supplies the posterior one-third of the tongue (p. 483) with sensory fibres (common sensation and taste) and secretomotor fibres to the glands of the posterior third. These last relay in small ganglia in the mucous membrane.</p><h3 id=vagus-nerve>Vagus Nerve
<a class=anchor href=#vagus-nerve>#</a></h3><p>The vagus nerve emerges through the middle compartment of the jugular foramen, in which a small enlargement constitutes the superior ganglion. Just below the base of the skull the elongated inferior ganglion dilates the trunk. The ganglia contain cell bodies of the afferent fibres of the vagus; the superior ganglion for the unimportant meningeal and auricular branches, the inferior ganglion for all the sensory fibres that matter. The inferior ganglion receives a large branch from the accessory nerve; this is its complement of nucleus ambiguus fibres, which the accessory nerve (cranial part) has carried for it through the jugular foramen. These nucleus ambiguus fibres supply all the striated muscle of the viscera (pharynx, soft palate, oesophagus, larynx).</p><p>The nerve runs straight down the neck, contained in the back of the carotid sheath, between carotid artery and jugular vein. In the root of the neck it passes in front of the subclavian artery and so enters the mediastinum (p. 261) to supply thoracic and abdominal viscera.</p><p><strong>Meningeal Branches.</strong> These pass up from the superior ganglion to supply the dura mater of the posterior fossa below the tentorium.</p><p><strong>Auricular Branch.</strong> This runs laterally between the tympanic and mastoid parts of the temporal bone. It supplies the posteroinferior quadrant of the outer surface of the tympanic membrane and a small adjacent area of skin of the external acoustic meatus and a little of the corresponding skin behind the auricle.</p><p><strong>Carotid Body Branch.</strong> The very fine carotid body branch forms a plexus with the carotid sinus branch of the glossopharyngeal for the supply of those structures (above, and p. 438).</p><p><strong>Pharyngeal Branch.</strong> The pharyngeal branch of the vagus slopes forward across the internal carotid artery parallel with and below the glossopharyngeal nerve and joins the pharyngeal plexus on the middle constrictor muscle (p. 489). Its fibres are derived from the accessory nerve by its branch to the inferior ganglion of the vagus; their cell bodies lie in the nucleus ambiguus in the medulla. The fibres supply the muscles of the pharynx (except stylopharyngeus) and the muscles of the soft palate (except tensor palati, p. 495).</p><p><strong>Superior Laryngeal Nerve.</strong> This slopes downwards on the side wall of the pharynx deep to the internal carotid artery. At about the level of the hyoid bone but often much higher it divides into a large internal laryngeal nerve which pierces the thyrohyoid membrane to reach the piriform recess (p. 491) and a small external laryngeal nerve which runs close to the superior thyroid vessels and passes down outside the larynx to supply cricothyroid and possibly the cricopharyngeus part of the inferior constrictor.</p><p><strong>Cervical Cardiac Branches.</strong> These are two on each side. On the right they pass down behind the subclavian artery to the deep part of the cardiac plexus (p. 259). On the left the upper nerve passes alongside the trachea to the deep part; the lower nerve crosses the arch of the aorta to the superficial part of the plexus. (Note that the superficial part receives only the upper sympathetic and lower vagal branch from the left side; all the other cardiac branches of sympathetic and vagus go to the deep part of the plexus.)</p><p><strong>Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve.</strong> This hooks around the ligamentum arteriosum on the left side and around the subclavian artery on the right side (Fig. 4.15, p. 258, and Fig. 6.7). Thence it runs up near the posterior border of the trachea to pass under the lower border of the inferior constrictor (cricopharyngeus part). Its relationship to the thyroid gland is described on page 431. The nerve has cardiac branches, and also supplies the trachea, oesophagus and possibly the cricopharyngeus part of the inferior constrictor before entering the pharynx and larynx to supply the laryngeal muscles (except cricothyroid) and the laryngeal mucosa below the vocal folds (p. 504).</p><h3 id=accessory-nerve>Accessory Nerve
<a class=anchor href=#accessory-nerve>#</a></h3><p>The accessory nerve is formed in the posterior cranial fossa by union of cranial and spinal (cervical) roots. The nerve occupies the middle compartment in the jugular foramen, just lateral to the vagus. All the fibres of its cranial root leave the nerve in a branch which joins the vagus. The nerve, now consisting of cervical fibres only, slopes down on the internal jugular vein where the latter lies on the lateral mass of the atlas. It passes deep to the styloid process and posterior belly of the digastric and gives off a branch to sternocleidomastoid. It pierces the muscle near the entrance of the motor branch; here it is crossed by the upper sternocleidomastoid branch of the occipital artery. The nerve passes through the muscle across the posterior triangle to trapezius (p. 426), which it supplies. Proprioceptive fibres from the muscles reach the spinal cord in the ordinary way, through C2 and 3 for sternocleidomastoid and through C3 and 4 for trapezius.</p><h3 id=hypoglossal-nerve>Hypoglossal Nerve
<a class=anchor href=#hypoglossal-nerve>#</a></h3><p>The hypoglossal nerve emerges from the hypoglossal canal. It picks up a substantial branch from the anterior ramus of C1 and then spirals behind the inferior ganglion of the vagus to emerge between the internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein. It lies on the carotid sheath deep to the styloid muscles and the posterior belly of digastric, then curls forward just beneath the tendon of digastric, across the arteries and deep to the veins (p. 462) to pass to the tongue (p. 482).</p><p>Hypoglossal fibres supply only tongue muscles. Their cell bodies are in the hypoglossal nucleus in the medulla. The tongue muscle is derived from suboccipital myotomes, which in their migration through the neck pass between the carotid arteries (external and internal) lying deep, and the jugular vein lying superficial, dragging their nerve behind them. There are no sensory fibres in the hypoglossal nerve. In this the nerve resembles the third, fourth, sixth and accessory nerves. The muscles of the orbit and face have a proprioceptive supply (by the trigeminal to its mesencephalic nucleus) and sternocleidomastoid and trapezius, supplied by the spinal part of the accessory, have a proprioceptive supply from C2, 3 and 4. The muscles of the tongue have been shown to contain spindles, but their afferent innervation remains uncertain. It may be via the lingual branch of the mandibular nerve or cervical nerves.</p><h2 id=styloid-process>Styloid Process
<a class=anchor href=#styloid-process>#</a></h2><p>The styloid process is a part of the temporal bone that (like the petrous part) ossifies in cartilage. From its tip the stylohyoid ligament passes to the lesser horn of the hyoid bone (Fig. 6.17). Both process and ligament are remnants of the second pharyngeal arch cartilage (p. 38); the unossified cartilage disappears, its perichondrium persisting as the ligament. Hence the styloid process is very variable in length, the ligament varying likewise, inversely with it.</p><p>Three muscles diverge from the styloid process and are described where noted. The stylopharyngeus (p. 489) is deepest and arises highest; it passes almost vertically downwards to the larynx. The stylohyoid (p. 428) arises from behind high up and the styloglossus (p. 482) from in front low down; they diverge to the lower and upper borders of the side of the tongue. Each of the three muscles has a different nerve supply. They all act significantly during swallowing (p. 525). The styloid apparatus lies lateral to the carotid sheath and helps the latter to close in the infratemporal fossa posteriorly. Its upper part lies in the bed of the parotid gland.</p><p>The external carotid artery passes between the muscles of the stylohyoid apparatus. It runs up deep to digastric and stylohyoid, but superficial to stylopharyngeus (Fig. 6.16), to enter the parotid gland. The retromandibular vein on the other hand, passes down from the parotid gland superficial to stylohyoid and digastric.</p><h2 id=pterygopalatine-fossa>Pterygopalatine Fossa
<a class=anchor href=#pterygopalatine-fossa>#</a></h2><p>This fossa is a small space between the back of the maxilla and the front of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone, and is concerned with the blood and nerve supply of the upper jaw. It cannot all be seen in the intact skull, but it communicates with the infratemporal fossa through the pterygomaxillary fissure; hold a skull so that you can look into this fissure from below the zygomatic arch, and you can then appreciate where the fossa is.</p><p>Examine a skull. In the infratemporal fossa the maxilla and the lower part of the lateral pterygoid plate are joined by the pyramidal process of the palatine bone (Fig. 6.11); they separate above at the pterygomaxillary fissure which leads into the pterygopalatine fossa. On the lateral wall of the nose the maxilla is separated from the medial pterygoid plate by the perpendicular plate of the palatine bone. This plate articulates with the maxilla; between the two lies the greater palatine canal which opens below at a foramen on the hard palate. The greater palatine canal opens above into the fossa, for here the perpendicular plate of the palatine bone bifurcates; one limb remains attached to the maxilla, the other limb passes back to articulate with the sphenoid (Fig. 8.12, p. 661). Between the two lies the sphenopalatine foramen, leading from the fossa into the lateral wall of the nose (Fig. 6.22B).</p><p>The pterygopalatine fossa is thus seen to be bounded posteriorly by the sphenoid bone (root of the pterygoid process containing the pterygoid canal and greater wing containing the foramen rotundum, Fig. 8.7, p. 657). Medially the fossa is walled in by the palatine bone (with its notch, bounding the sphenopalatine foramen) and anteriorly by the posterior wall of the maxilla, below the apex of the floor of the orbit (p. 506). The roof is the body of the sphenoid and the orbital process of the palatine.</p><p>The passages leading from the fossa should be identified on the skull with the aid of a piece of flexible fine wire or bristle. A wire passed into the pterygomaxillary fissure passes across the fossa to enter the nose through the sphenopalatine foramen, the last named closed in life by the mucous membrane of the lateral wall of the nose. A wire passed through the foramen rotundum from the middle cranial fossa enters the pterygopalatine fossa from behind; this is the course of the maxillary nerve which, on leaving the fossa, turns laterally in the inferior orbital fissure to reach the infraorbital groove. A wire passed through the pterygoid canal from the foramen lacerum also enters the fossa from behind but below and medial to the foramen rotundum; this is the course of the nerve of the pterygoid canal. A wire passed into the greater or lesser palatine foramina enters the fossa from below along the canal which lodges the nerves of the palate. A wire passed through the palatovaginal canal in the roof of the nose passes forward into the fossa; this is the course of the pharyngeal branch of the pterygopalatine ganglion (Fig. 8.5, p. 651).</p><p>The fossa contains the maxillary vessels and nerve and the pterygopalatine ganglion (Figs 6.18 and 6.19). The ganglion sends branches into the nose and palate, and the maxillary nerve supplies the upper teeth, floor of the orbit and skin of the face. Branches of the maxillary vessels accompany all these nerves.</p><h3 id=maxillary-nerve>Maxillary Nerve
<a class=anchor href=#maxillary-nerve>#</a></h3><p>The maxillary nerve, giving a meningeal branch to the front of the middle cranial fossa, passes through the foramen rotundum in the greater wing of the sphenoid bone into the pterygopalatine fossa. Deviating laterally in the inferior orbital fissure for about 1 cm, it turns forwards to enter the infraorbital groove and canal in the floor of the orbit, changing its name to the infraorbital nerve and eventually emerging from the front end of the canal at the infraorbital foramen to supply skin on the face (p. 451). The zygomatic nerve arises from the maxillary in the fossa and runs above the maxillary in the inferior orbital fissure to enter the orbit (p. 512).</p><p>In the fossa the pterygopalatine ganglion is connected to the maxillary nerve by a short thick trunk that contains fibres going both to and from the ganglion, and a little further forward the posterior superior alveolar nerve is given off. It passes through the pterygomaxillary fissure on to the posterior wall of the maxilla, where it has already been described (p. 459).</p><h3 id=pterygopalatine-ganglion>Pterygopalatine Ganglion
<a class=anchor href=#pterygopalatine-ganglion>#</a></h3><p>The pterygopalatine ganglion (Fig. 6.19) is a relay station between the superior salivary nucleus in the pons and the lacrimal gland and mucous and serous glands of the nose, palate and upper pharynx. It receives the nerve of the pterygoid canal (p. 571), containing parasympathetic secretomotor fibres, with the deep petrosal nerve, containing sympathetic vasoconstrictor fibres. The latter is a branch given off from the carotid nerve in the foramen lacerum. The combined nerve passes forward in the pterygoid canal and joins the ganglion.</p><p>The secretomotor fibres to the lacrimal gland leave their cell bodies in the ganglion and join the maxillary nerve through the stout connection, pass in its zygomatic branch into the orbit, join the lacrimal branch of the ophthalmic nerve and so reach the lacrimal gland.</p><p>The rest of the fibres in the connection between the maxillary nerve and the ganglion are sensory and, like the sympathetic fibres in the deep petrosal nerve, they pass through the ganglion without relay. The only cell bodies in the ganglion are parasympathetic (secretomotor). The five branches of the pterygopalatine ganglion are distributed to the nose and palate. Every branch carries a mixture of all three kinds of fibres: sensory, secretomotor and sympathetic.</p><p><strong>Nasopalatine Nerve.</strong> This (formerly the long sphenopalatine) passes through the sphenopalatine foramen, crosses the roof of the nose, and is distributed to the septum and incisive gum of the hard palate (p. 473).</p><p><strong>Lateral Posterior Superior Nasal Nerves.</strong> These (formerly the short sphenopalatine) pass through the sphenopalatine foramen and turn forward to supply the posterosuperior quadrant of the lateral wall of the nose (p. 473).</p><p><strong>Greater Palatine Nerve.</strong> This passes down through the greater palatine canal and at the greater palatine foramen turns forward to supply the mucous membrane of the hard palate (Fig. 6.19). Its nasal branches supply the posteroinferior quadrant of the lateral wall of the nose (p. 473). It gives branches to the medial wall of the maxillary sinus.</p><p><strong>Lesser Palatine Nerves.</strong> These, two in number, pass down behind the greater palatine nerve and emerge through the lesser palatine foramina behind the crest of the palatine bone. They pass back to the soft palate and the mucous membrane of the palatine tonsil.</p><p><strong>Pharyngeal Nerve.</strong> This passes back through the palatovaginal canal, emerges at the roof of the nose and supplies the mucous membrane of the upper nasopharynx (p. 489). One or two very fine orbital branches enter the orbit via the inferior orbital fissure and supply part of the periosteum and also the orbitalis muscle and the mucous membrane of the sphenoidal and ethmoidal sinuses.</p><h3 id=maxillary-vessels>Maxillary Vessels
<a class=anchor href=#maxillary-vessels>#</a></h3><p>The maxillary artery passes through the pterygomaxillary fissure and enters the pterygopalatine fossa, lying just below the maxillary nerve, where it gives off five branches that pass with the five branches of the pterygopalatine ganglion.</p><p>Another branch, the infraorbital, passes through the inferior orbital fissure and accompanies the infraorbital nerve along the floor of the orbit and, almost spent, emerges on the face through the infraorbital foramen.</p><p>Veins accompany the above arteries and, passing through the fossa, emerge at the pterygomaxillary fissure to drain into the pterygoid plexus. In general, vessels in the fossa lie anterior to the nerves.</p><h2 id=nose>Nose
<a class=anchor href=#nose>#</a></h2><p>The nose is for breathing; the design of its cavity results in warming and moistening the inspired air, and in cleaning it too. Since odours are airborne, the olfactory receptors are placed in the nose. The floor of the nose is the hard palate. Hence chewing can go on in the mouth cavity without interfering with breathing; the flap valve of the soft palate meanwhile shuts off the mouth cavity from the airway through the oropharynx. Breathing is arrested during swallowing; the soft palate is elevated and shuts off the nose (i.e. the nasopharynx) from the foodway through the oropharynx. Thus the oropharynx is the crossroads of airway and foodway; collisions between air stream and food are avoided by the control mechanism of the soft palate acting as the policeman on point duty.</p><p>The nose consists of the external nose and the nasal cavity, which is divided into right and left halves by the midline nasal septum. Each half of the cavity has olfactory, vestibular and respiratory parts depending on the type of epithelial covering.</p><h3 id=external-nose>External Nose
<a class=anchor href=#external-nose>#</a></h3><p>The external nose projects from the face; its skeleton is largely cartilaginous. Examine a skull. The anterior nasal (piriform) aperture is bounded above by the nasal bones and elsewhere by the two maxillae (Fig. 8.2, p. 644). The external nose consists of the nasal bones (the bridge of the nose) and the lateral (upper) and greater (alar or lower) nasal cartilages, supported in the midline by the cartilaginous part of the nasal septum. A pad of fibrofatty tissue forms the lateral boundary of the nostril itself; this and the adjacent cartilage are moved by the compressor and dilator naris muscles. These and other very small cartilages are of the hyaline variety. The whole is covered by adherent skin that contains many sebaceous glands and internally its upper part is lined with respiratory mucous membrane. The skin extends into the vestibule within the nostrils and here has a variable crop of stiff hairs. The mucocutaneous junction lies beyond the hair bearing area.</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> The skin is supplied by the external nasal nerve (the terminal part of the anterior ethmoidal), which notches the nasal bone and passes down on the upper and lower nasal cartilage to the tip of the nose, by the supratrochlear and infratrochlear nerves (from the frontal).</p><p><strong>Blood supply.</strong> The blood supply is by the dorsal nasal artery (a terminal branch of the ophthalmic) at the base, and lower down by the external nasal (from the anterior ethmoidal) and by the lateral nasal and septal branches of the facial and its superior labial branch respectively.</p><h3 id=nasal-cavity>Nasal Cavity
<a class=anchor href=#nasal-cavity>#</a></h3><p>The nasal cavity extends from the nostrils (anterior nares) to the posterior end of the nasal septum. Posteriorly it opens into the nasopharynx (p. 489) through the posterior nasal apertures.</p><p>Most of the cavity is the respiratory area, lined by respiratory mucous membrane with pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium. The surface area of the lateral wall is increased by the projection of the nasal conchae. The mucous membrane is very vascular, especially over the inferior concha, to warm the inspired air. Mucous secretion traps particulate matter, and the cilia beat the film of mucus back into the nasopharynx. The watery secretion of serous glands evaporates to moisten the inspired air.</p><p>The olfactory area, which contains the receptors for the special sense of smell, occupies the roof and uppermost parts of the nasal septum and lateral wall, over but not below the superior concha.</p><p>The floor of the nose is the roof of the mouth - the hard palate. The lateral wall of the nose is, above, the medial wall of the orbit (the ethmoidal air cells intervening) and, below, the medial wall of the maxillary sinus. The floor of the sinus often lies at a lower level than the floor of the nasal cavity.</p><p>The lateral wall and septum are close together at the narrow roof (perhaps only 2 mm apart) and further apart at the broader floor. In cross-section the nasal cavity is pear-shaped, but three conchae project into it with increasing prominence from above down, so that the distances between conchae and septum are about equal (Fig. 6.20).</p><p><strong>Nasal Septum.</strong> The framework of the nasal septum consists of the vomer, the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid and the septal cartilage (see below and Fig. 6.22). The cartilage extends forwards to give shape and prominence to the external nose. The septum is nearly always deviated from the midline. The mucous membrane (mucoperiosteum and mucoperichondrium) is firmly bound to the framework but can be readily stripped off from the cartilage, as in the operation of submucous resection (which should properly be called subperichondrial resection).</p><p><strong>Lateral Wall.</strong> The lateral wall should be studied in the intact specimen and in the dried skull (Fig. 6.22B). In the living it is covered with mucous membrane that is very vascular and adherent to the periosteum of the underlying bone.</p><p>The shape of the lateral wall is roughly semicircular, that is, highest halfway along, at the cribriform plate of the ethmoid. From the vestibule the roof curves up to this level; behind the cribriform plate the roof curves down over the body of the sphenoid into the nasopharynx (Fig. 6.21). The lateral wall is not vertical, but slopes up from the broad nasal floor to the narrow roof.</p><p>There are three nasal conchae (still often called by ENT surgeons by their old name of turbinate bones) projecting downwards like scrolls from the lateral wall. The lowest is the longest. The middle and upper are joined anteriorly, but diverge away from each other posteriorly. Beneath the free inferior border of each concha is a space, called superior, middle and inferior meatus respectively. Above the superior concha is the sphenoethmoidal recess. The sphenoidal sinus opens into this recess and the posterior ethmoidal air cells into the superior meatus. The nasolacrimal duct opens into the inferior meatus. The middle meatus receives all the other openings into the lateral wall (Fig. 6.21).</p><p>The inferior concha is the longest and broadest of the three conchae. It is covered with mucous membrane that contains large vascular spaces, erectile tissue that controls the calibre of the nasal cavity. It can swell and block the nose rapidly. It overhangs the inferior meatus, which receives the nasolacrimal duct, draining excess tears from the eye. The duct opens 2 cm behind the nostril. About 1 cm behind the inferior concha (not in the nasal cavity but in the nasopharynx) is the opening of the auditory tube.</p><p>The sphenoethmoidal recess lies above and behind the superior concha. It receives the ostium of the sphenoidal air sinus. Strictly speaking the sphenoidal ostium is in the narrow roof rather than in the lateral wall (Fig. 6.22B).</p><p>The superior concha is small. It extends posteriorly from its junction with the middle concha. Its lower edge is free and overlies the superior meatus, into which drain the posterior ethmoidal air cells.</p><p>The middle concha is midway in size and position between superior and inferior. It extends horizontally back from its junction with the superior concha. It overhangs the middle meatus, which can be seen only when the concha is displaced (Fig. 6.21). Immediately behind the posterior end of the middle concha beneath the mucous membrane is the sphenopalatine foramen. The flat area in front of the concha is the atrium of the nose.</p><p>The middle meatus presents a convex bulge beneath the concha. This is the ethmoidal bulla of the ethmoid, produced by the bulging of one or more middle ethmoidal air cells, whose ostium opens on the bulla, usually high up. Beneath the bulla is a semicircular slit, the semilunar hiatus, into which open the remaining paranasal sinuses. The frontal sinus opens through the infundibulum into the anterior end of the hiatus. The anterior ethmoidal cells open through ostia nearby in the hiatus or, quite frequently, directly into the infundibulum of the frontal sinus. The maxillary sinus opens near the posterior end of the hiatus, often by a double ostium.</p><p><strong>Blood supply.</strong> The main artery of the nasal cavity is the sphenopalatine, which is the end of the maxillary artery that has changed its name on passing through the sphenopalatine foramen. It supplies the mucosa over the conchae and the meatuses, and also much of the septum. On the lower anterior part of the septum (Little&rsquo;s area) it anastomoses with the septal branch of the superior labial (entering through the nostril) and the ascending branch of the greater palatine (entering through the incisive canal - see below), so forming Kiesselbach&rsquo;s plexus, the common site for epistaxis (nosebleed). Anterior and posterior ethmoidal vessels supply the roof and anterior part of the lateral wall.</p><p><strong>Lymphatics.</strong> Lymphatics tend to run with the veins rather than arteries, and drain to submandibular, deep cervical and retropharyngeal nodes.</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> The olfactory area of the roof, superior concha and corresponding part of the septum has the olfactory receptors and the cell bodies of the bipolar cells embedded within the mucosa. The central process of the bipolar cells form the 20 or so filaments of the olfactory nerve which pierce the cribriform plate of the ethmoid to reach the anterior cranial fossa, where they synapse with the mitral cells of the olfactory bulb (p. 589). This olfactory area also contains fibres of ordinary sensation from adjacent areas.</p><p>The vestibular area is supplied by the infraorbital nerve whose branches have crept in from the face. The rest of the lateral wall, the respiratory area, is supplied as follows: at the front by the anterior ethmoidal nerve (through its own foramen) in the upper part, and in the lower part by some filaments from the anterior superior alveolar nerve which pierce the wall of the maxillary sinus; at the upper back part by the lateral posterior superior nasal branches from the pterygopalatine ganglion (entering through the sphenopalatine foramen) and at the lower back part by the posterior inferior nasal branches of the greater palatine nerve (entering through their own minute foramina in the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone).</p><p>In contrast to the above total of six nerves supplying the lateral wall, the septum is supplied by four nerves: olfactory in the upper part, anterior ethmoidal at the front, medial posterior superior nasal at the back (via the sphenopalatine foramen), and the nasopalatine (formerly the long sphenopalatine) also entering through the sphenopalatine foramen and running to the front in the groove on the vomer to enter the incisive canal.</p><p><strong>Sneezing.</strong> This protective reflex expels irritant material trapped in the nose. First there is a reflex secretion (no use to sneeze through a dry nose), then this secretion itself (as in coryza) initiates the sneeze reflex. The excess secretion with its trapped particles is blasted out of the nostrils. The soft palate controls the volume of the nasal blast, the rest of the compressed air escaping harmlessly through the mouth (see p. 476). The afferent path for the sneeze reflex involves the branches of the trigeminal nerve supplying the nasal mucosa, and the efferent nerves are similar to those for the cough reflex (p. 503).</p><h3 id=skeleton-of-the-nose>Skeleton of the Nose
<a class=anchor href=#skeleton-of-the-nose>#</a></h3><p>Examine the longitudinal section of a skull made alongside the nasal septum.</p><p>The septum consists of the vomer, ethmoid and septal cartilage (Fig. 6.22A). The vomer is fixed to the rostrum of the sphenoid by its alae. It forms the posterior border of the septum and, slotted into a grooved ridge on the hard palate, extends like a ploughshare forwards beyond the incisive canal. It is grooved on each side by the sphenopalatine vessels.</p><p>The perpendicular plate of the ethmoid forms a suture with the upper border of the vomer. It completes the posterior part of the bony septum, but falls short of the anterior extremity of the vomer. The septal cartilage fills the angle between the two bones.</p><p>The central part of the roof is the cribriform plate of the ethmoid. At the front, sloping downwards, are the nasal spine of the frontal bone and the nasal bone. At the back is the backward-sloping body of the sphenoid.</p><p>The lateral wall of the nose can only be studied adequately if the delicate bones have not been broken away. The frontal process of the maxilla and the nasal bones are in front. Behind them, study the lateral wall by building it up on the maxilla (Fig. 6.22B). The maxilla (carrying all the upper teeth) is stabilized laterally by the flying buttress of bone called the zygomatic arch (Fig. 6.14) and medially by the firm articulation of the palatal process with the opposite one.</p><p>The maxillary sinus opens on the medial wall of the maxilla by a large gap (Fig. 8.10, p. 660) which is made much smaller by the encroachment of parts of four neighbouring bones (palatine, inferior concha, ethmoid and lacrimal) and by mucous membrane unsupported by bone. The palatine bone sends a vertical plate across the posterior part of the maxillary hiatus. Between the two bones lies the greater palatine canal. The upper part of the perpendicular plate of the palatine bone is divided by a deep notch into orbital and sphenoidal processes which articulate with the maxilla in the apex of the floor of the orbit and with the body of the sphenoid bone (Fig. 8.12, p. 661). Thus is enclosed the sphenopalatine foramen which opens from the pterygopalatine fossa through the lateral wall of the nose just above the posterior end of the middle concha and just beneath the downward-sloping roof of the nasal cavity (Fig. 6.22B). Unlike the superior and middle conchae which are part of the ethmoid bone, the inferior concha is a separate bone. Its vertical maxillary process covers the lower part of the maxillary hiatus; the anterior part of the concha articulates with the conchal crest of the maxilla (Fig. 8.10. p. 660), the posterior part articulates with the conchal crest of the palatine bone (Fig. 8.11, p. 661). The lacrimal bone articulates with the frontal process of the maxilla and with the base of the inferior concha; the nasolacrimal duct is enclosed between them. The ethmoid bone articulates by its lateral mass (labyrinth) at the upper border of the maxillary hiatus. Below this level the uncinate process of the ethmoid curves back beneath the bulla to articulate with the base of the inferior concha. Between bulla and uncinate process lies the semilunar hiatus. The medial pterygoid plate lies edge to edge behind the perpendicular plate of the palatine bone and completes the lateral wall of the nose.</p><p>The bones of the lateral wall are considered individually on page 659 et seq.</p><h2 id=paranasal-sinuses>Paranasal Sinuses
<a class=anchor href=#paranasal-sinuses>#</a></h2><p>There are four (bilateral) sinuses. The maxillary and ethmoidal sinuses are beyond the lateral wall of the nose. The frontal and sphenoidal sinuses abut at the midline, separated by a tiny bony septum that is almost always off centre, causing asymmetry of these sinuses.</p><h3 id=maxillary-sinus>Maxillary Sinus
<a class=anchor href=#maxillary-sinus>#</a></h3><p>The maxillary sinus is the space within the body of the maxilla, known in earlier days as the maxillary antrum (of Highmore). The sinus is pyramidal in shape, the base at the lateral wall of the nose and the apex in the zygomatic process of the maxilla. The roof of the sinus is the floor of the orbit. The floor of the sinus is the alveolar part (tooth-bearing area) of the maxilla; it lies at a lower level than the floor of the nose. Anterior and posterior walls are the corresponding walls of the maxilla. Certain ridges appear within the cavity; a constant one is at the junction of roof and anterior wall, produced by the downward passage of the infraorbital nerve within its canal (Fig. 8.10, p. 660).</p><p>The maxillary sinus is present at birth, but is no more than a shallow slit, slightly overgrown into a short cul-de-sac anteriorly and posteriorly. It excavates the lateral wall of the nose, beneath the middle concha, and lies just beneath the medial side of the floor of the orbit. The body of the neonatal maxilla lateral to this is full of developing teeth.</p><p>The sinus varies in size; a large one may extend into the zygomatic process of the maxilla and into the alveolar process so that the roots of the three molar teeth (and possibly of the premolars also) lie immediately beneath the floor or project into it. The roots are usually enclosed in a thin layer of compact bone; when this is absent the apex of the root is in contact with the mucous membrane. Extraction of such a tooth must leave a fistula by rupture of the mucous membrane. These fistulae mostly heal spontaneously.</p><p>The ostium of the sinus is high up and well back on its nasal wall. It is 2-4 mm in diameter. (A second smaller ostium often lies posteriorly.) It opens at the posterior end of the semilunar hiatus in the middle meatus of the lateral wall of the nose (Figs 6.21 and 6.18).</p><p><strong>Blood supply.</strong> By small arteries that pierce the bone, mostly from the facial, maxillary, infraorbital and greater palatine arteries, and veins accompany these vessels to the facial vein and to the pterygoid plexus.</p><p><strong>Lymph drainage.</strong> For the most part via the infraorbital foramen or the ostium; in either case the lymphatics flow to the submandibular nodes.</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> By various branches of the maxillary nerve: superior alveolar (posterior, middle and anterior), the greater palatine and infraorbital.</p><p>The dental branches of the posterior superior alveolar nerve (p. 459) pass forwards in the bone above the apices of the molar teeth, which they supply. Minute branches pierce the bone to supply the mucous membrane of the sinus.</p><p>The middle superior alveolar nerve leaves the infraorbital nerve on the floor of the orbit and runs down in the lateral wall of the maxilla to supply the premolar teeth, and the overlying mucous membrane of the sinus. It forms loops in the bone with the posterior and anterior superior alveolar nerves (superior dental plexus). It is sometimes absent, in which case its supply to the teeth is usually taken over by the anterior superior alveolar nerve.</p><p>The anterior superior alveolar nerve leaves the infraorbital nerve in the infraorbital canal in the roof of the sinus. It passes laterally, then curves medially below the infraorbital foramen, in the anterior wall of the maxilla (Fig. 6.23). It supplies the pulps of the canine and incisor teeth, and the anteroinferior quadrant of the lateral wall of the nose, spilling over on to the floor of the nose and perhaps the septum anteriorly. Branches innervate the mucous membrane of the anterior wall of the sinus.</p><h3 id=ethmoidal-sinus>Ethmoidal Sinus
<a class=anchor href=#ethmoidal-sinus>#</a></h3><p>Each ethmoidal sinus lies between the orbit and the nose (Fig. 6.20), in the ethmoidal labyrinth (lateral part of the ethmoid bone). The sinus is not a single cavity, being divided by bony septa into a variable number of ethmoidal air cells (sometimes themselves called sinuses). There may be only 3 or as many as 18, each with their own ostium, and they are called anterior, middle or posterior according to where they drain (see below). The lateral wall of the labyrinth, in the medial wall of the orbit, is paper-thin (the lamina papyracea) and it is usually possible to see through it and distinguish some of the honeycomb-like air cells. The superior and middle nasal conchae project from its medial (nasal) wall. The labyrinth does not have its own roof but is closed in by the orbital part of the frontal bone (Fig. 8.6, p. 656), whose medial edge articulates with the cribriform plate of the ethmoid. The anterior and posterior ethmoidal nerves pass between the roof of frontal bone and the ethmoid itself.</p><p>The anterior ethmoidal air cells occupy the anterior part of the sinus. Roofed in by the frontal bone, the bony walls are completed by the lacrimal bone. The ostia open into the anterior part of the semilunar hiatus in the middle meatus. A separate septum in the anterior part encloses a funnel-shaped canal (the ethmoidal infundibulum), which connects the frontal sinus above with the hiatus. The anterior ethmoidal cells may open into the infundibulum directly, instead of separately into the hiatus. One or more cells may lie in front of the frontonasal duct that drains the frontal sinus into the semilunar hiatus.</p><p>The middle ethmoidal air cells also drain into the middle meatus. One or more project as a convexity into the lateral wall of the nose under cover of the middle concha, forming the ethmoidal bulla. Ostia on its upper margin open into the middle meatus.</p><p>At the back of the labyrinth the posterior ethmoidal air cells are completed by fusion of the orbital process of the palatine bone and the sphenoidal concha (p. 657). They are roofed in by the orbital part of the frontal bone, between which and the lamina papyracea lies the posterior ethmoidal foramen whose opening in the medial wall of the orbit lies 1 cm behind its anterior companion, both transmitting the corresponding nerves and vessels. The posterior air cells drain into the superior meatus; this fact distinguishes them from middle air cells which open into the middle meatus. The most posterior air cell may extend far enough back to lie immediately adjacent to the optic nerve in its canal.</p><p><strong>Blood supply.</strong> By branches from the supraorbital, anterior and posterior ethmoidal and sphenopalatine, i.e. from both the internal and external carotid systems.</p><p><strong>Lymph drainage.</strong> To submandibular and retropharyngeal nodes.</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> By small branches from various nerves which include the supraorbital, anterior ethmoidal, lateral posterior superior nasal, orbital and posterior ethmoidal. The significant feature is that the posterior cells may receive fibres from both the ophthalmic and maxillary branches of the trigeminal, with the possibility of referred pain to either branch.</p><h3 id=sphenoidal-sinus>Sphenoidal Sinus
<a class=anchor href=#sphenoidal-sinus>#</a></h3><p>The pair of sphenoidal sinuses occupy the body of the sphenoid bone (Figs 6.21 and 8.7, p. 657). The two are separated by a septum which is usually not in the midline, and they can vary greatly in size. When small the sinus lies in front of the pituitary fossa; as it enlarges it lies beneath the fossa and may extend back into the basiocciput. A large sinus may also extend into the greater wing of sphenoid and pterygoid process.</p><p>A typical sinus is related above to the pituitary fossa and middle cranial fossa, and laterally to the cavernous sinus and internal carotid artery. Behind lie the posterior cranial fossa and pons, while below is the roof of the nasopharynx. Internally a large sinus may show a variable number of indentations or ridges produced by adjacent structures; in the roof, the pituitary gland and optic nerve; at the side, the internal carotid artery and maxillary nerve; and in the floor, the pterygoid canal with its nerve and the palatovaginal canal with the pharyngeal branch of the pterygopalatine ganglion.</p><p>The ostium is in the anterior wall of the sinus and opens into the sphenoethmoidal recess (behind the superior concha).</p><p><strong>Blood supply.</strong> From the posterior ethmoidal and sphenopalatine branches of the maxillary artery.</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> By the posterior ethmoidal nerve and the orbital branch of the pterygopalatine ganglion (maxillary nerve).</p><h3 id=frontal-sinus>Frontal Sinus
<a class=anchor href=#frontal-sinus>#</a></h3><p>The frontal sinuses are the only sinuses not present at birth; they appear during the second year as excavations into the diploe of the frontal bone, and are really anterior ethmoidal air cells that have migrated upwards. Each extends above the medial end of the eyebrow into the squamous part of the frontal bone and backwards into the orbital part and so into the medial part of the roof of the orbit (Fig. 6.21). The two sinuses are unequal in extent and are separated by a bony septum in the midline region. The important relations are thus the anterior cranial fossa and the orbit. The sinus drains through an ostium at its lower medial corner into the front end of the semilunar hiatus, either via the ethmoidal infundibulum or by a separate channel, the frontonasal duct, through anterior ethmoidal air cells.</p><p><strong>Blood supply.</strong> By supratrochlear, supraorbital and anterior ethmoidal arteries. Venous drainage is into diploic and superior ophthalmic veins.</p><p><strong>Lymph drainage.</strong> Across the face to the submandibular nodes. Note the different drainage of the overlying eyebrow skin, which is to preauricular nodes.</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> By the supraorbital and supratrochlear nerves by branches that pierce the frontal bone.</p><h3 id=development-of-the-nose-and-sinuses>Development of the Nose and Sinuses
<a class=anchor href=#development-of-the-nose-and-sinuses>#</a></h3><p>The development of the nose is considered on page 41. The frontal sinus is absent and the remainder are rudimentary at birth. They continue to enlarge throughout life, but not at a constant rate - there are spurts of enlargement. From birth to adult life growth of a sinus is due to enlargement of the bone that encloses it; in old age growth of a sinus is due to resorption of surrounding cancellous bone.</p><p>The early enlargement of all the sinuses coincides with the eruption of the second dentition. At this period the baby face elongates and takes on more adult contours (see p. 47).</p><h2 id=mouth>Mouth
<a class=anchor href=#mouth>#</a></h2><p>The mouth extends from the lips to the palatoglossal arches (anterior pillars of the fauces). It is enclosed by the lips and cheeks; the slit-like space between lips/cheeks and teeth/gingivae (gums) is the vestibule of the mouth. The space inside the teeth and gums is the mouth cavity proper. The floor is largely occupied by the tongue, and the roof is the hard palate; breathing goes on during mastication, with the flap valve soft palate standing sentinel behind.</p><p>The mouth is for eating and talking through, and its structure is adapted accordingly. It serves also as an emergency airway in dyspnoea, but its structure has nothing to do with this function - it merely provides a bigger airhole than the narrow nostrils. The mobile lips (p. 477) are indispensable to articulate speech (except in ventriloquists). They are prehensile, too, for grasping food or sucking in liquid. The cheek pouch of the vestibule prevents chewed food from spilling to the ground and the buccinator returns it to the molar teeth for rechewing.</p><p>The tongue is for grasping food, for moving it during mastication, and for swallowing it. The delicate movements of the tongue turn laryngeal noise into articulate speech. In addition its mucous membrane is highly sensitive, even more than fingertips. It detects a fish bone and spits it out if nobody is looking, or feels a hot potato and spits it out even if people are looking. It is better than a fingertip, for it possesses also the sense of taste, to accept or reject what is in the mouth. The tongue is the mouth; all the rest is accessory.</p><p>The mucous membrane of the mouth is adherent to the deeper structures: on lips and cheek to the face muscles, on tongue to the muscles thereof, on the hard palate to the periosteum of the bone. It is therefore seldom caught between the teeth when chewing. It is covered with stratified squamous epithelium and is supplied by the trigeminal nerve - above by the maxillary nerve and below by the mandibular nerve.</p><p>The lips and cheeks are covered with hairy skin, except for the red margin of the lips, which is devoid of hair. Their substance consists of the facial muscles in cadaverous individuals, added to by fat in the plump-faced. The groove between the buccinator and the anterior border of the masseter contains an encapsuled mass of fat, the suctorial pad, in the newborn. This pad often persists into adult life and does not shrivel even when, for any cause, the individual loses the rest of his body fat. It helps to prevent indrawing of the cheeks during sucking.</p><h3 id=vestibule-of-the-mouth>Vestibule of the Mouth
<a class=anchor href=#vestibule-of-the-mouth>#</a></h3><p>This is a closed space, lips and cheeks lying in contact with the teeth and gums. It leads, by the space behind the molar teeth, into the cavity of the mouth and in the rest position, with the teeth slightly parted, it communicates all round, between the teeth, with the mouth cavity.</p><p>On the mucous membrane of the cheek the parotid duct opens on a low papilla opposite the second upper molar tooth. Nearby are the tiny openings of the ducts of the molar glands. These are four or five small mucous glands lying on the outer surface of the buccinator near the parotid duct and their ducts pierce the muscle to reach the mucous membrane of the vestibule. There are many other mucous glands (buccal and labial) scattered in the vestibule, especially in the lower lip. Unlike the molar glands they all lie internal to the face muscles, in the mucous membrane of the vestibule. Many of them are visible (sago granules). They are palpable to the examining finger or to the individual&rsquo;s own tongue. The orifices of their tiny ducts are too small to see. (Submandibular and sublingual salivary secretions drain into the mouth cavity proper - see below.)</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> Much of the mucous membrane of the inside of the cheeks and lips is supplied by the buccal branch of the mandibular nerve, with contributions from the mental branch of the inferior alveolar (also mandibular) and the infraorbital branch of the maxillary nerve; the last two supply the red margin of the lower and upper lips respectively.</p><h3 id=gingivae>Gingivae
<a class=anchor href=#gingivae>#</a></h3><p>The gingivae (the proper name for the gums) are firmly attached to the alveolar margins of the jaws and surround the necks of the teeth. They consist of dense but vascular fibrous tissue with an overlying epithelium that is stratified squamous and thinly keratinized. With alveolar resorption (as after tooth extraction and in old age) the gingivae conform to the new bony outline. The change from alveolar mucosa (continuous with that of the cheek) to gingival mucosa takes place 3-4 mm from the vestibular reflection and is indicated by an abrupt change of colour: from transparent red alveolar to more opaque and less shiny gingival.</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> The upper gums are supplied by the superior alveolar, greater palatine and nasopalatine nerves (maxillary), while the lower receive their innervation from the inferior alveolar, buccal and lingual nerves (mandibular). Note that, while the buccal nerve spills over from the cheek on to the lower jaw, it does not usually innervate the upper gums.</p><h3 id=teeth>Teeth
<a class=anchor href=#teeth>#</a></h3><p>The bulk of a tooth consists of dentine, a hard avascular calcified tissue penetrated by minute canals, the dentinal tubules. The part of the tooth that projects into the mouth is the crown which is covered by enamel, the hardest of all calcified animal tissues, and the part held in the jaw is the root which is covered by cementum, a calcified tissue rather like bone. The term clinical crown refers to the part of the tooth seen in the mouth and does not exactly correspond to the enamel-covered anatomical crown whose lower part is obscured in the gingival sulcus by the free gingival margin of the gum. The junction between enamel and cementum is the cervical margin or neck, which forms a slightly narrowed waist to the tooth. Because enamel and cementum meet, dentine is not exposed on the surface. Inside the dentine is the pulp cavity, which communicates with the exterior via the root canal and the apical foramen at the apex of the tooth. The cavity is filled by dental pulp, with nerves (below), blood vessels (p. 459) and lymphatics (p. 435), all of which gain access to the pulp through the apical foramen. The pulp is covered with a single layer of tall columnar cells, the odontoblasts, lying in contact with the inner surface of the dentine. Throughout life they retain the power to produce dentine within the pulp cavity if the surface of the dentine is breached. The odontoblasts give off fine cytoplasmic processes that occupy the dentinal tubules.</p><p>The periodontal ligament holds the cementum to the bony walls of the tooth socket. It consists of collagen fibres passing obliquely from the alveolar bone towards the apex of the tooth; the fibres sling the tooth in position against pressure on its occlusal surface. It is really the modified periosteum of the alveolar bone. The ligament is radiolucent; in a radiograph of the tooth it shows as a clear interval between tooth and bone shadows.</p><h4 id=permanent-dentition>Permanent Dentition
<a class=anchor href=#permanent-dentition>#</a></h4><p>The human adult has from the midline 2 incisors, 1 canine, 2 premolars and 3 molars; that is, 8 teeth in each half-jaw, or 32 teeth in all. The shape of a tooth is adapted to its function. The incisors are for biting and cutting, the canines for holding (well developed in carnivores) and the premolars and molars for chewing. In clinical dentistry it is common to refer to teeth by number (1 to 8 starting from the midline) rather than by name, e.g. upper right 5 is the upper right second premolar.</p><p>The incisor crowns are chisel-shaped, adapted for biting. Upper and lower incisors do not meet edge to edge, but by a sliding overlap, like the blades of a pair of scissors. The canine crowns are pyramidal or conical, much more rugged than the incisor crowns. The premolar teeth have two cusps (lingual and buccal), whence their name of bicuspid teeth. Upper molars have four, lower molars five, cusps on their crowns.</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> The term nerve supply of a tooth really means the nerve supply of the pulp; some fine nerve filaments may enter some dentinal tubules, but most of the dentine and all enamel and cementum have no innervation.</p><p>In the upper jaw the three molar teeth are supplied by branches of the posterior superior alveolar nerve. The anterior buccal root of the first molar is supplied by the middle superior alveolar nerve, which supplies also the two premolars. The canine and incisor teeth are supplied by the anterior superior alveolar nerve. There may be variations from the above common pattern.</p><p>In the lower jaw the three molars and two premolars are supplied by the main trunk of the inferior alveolar nerve, whose terminal incisor branch supplies the canine and both incisors, overlapping to the opposite central incisor.</p><p><strong>Dental Anaesthesia.</strong> The alveolar bone of the maxilla is relatively porous, so anaesthetic solution deposited in the gingivae opposite the apex of a tooth root will readily penetrate the bone to anaesthetize the tooth for dental procedures. Infiltration of the buccal aspect of the jaw will allow painless drilling of the tooth, but for extraction the palatal aspect must be infiltrated as well.</p><p>For the teeth of the lower jaw infiltration anaesthesia is usually effective only for the incisors. The other mandibular teeth are embedded in bone that is denser and does not allow sufficient penetration of the anaesthetic agent. For these teeth, inferior alveolar nerve block is required; for extraction it is necessary to include block of the nearby lingual and buccal nerves as well in order to anaesthetize the adjacent soft tissues.</p><p>For infiltration anaesthesia on the buccal (outer) aspect of the jaw, the needle is inserted opposite the appropriate tooth just below or into the buccal fold (where the mucosa is reflected between jaw and cheek), with the tip of the needle directed to the level of the apex of the tooth. On the palatal side, the point of insertion of the needle is midway between the gingival margin and the midline of the palate.</p><p>For inferior alveolar and lingual nerve block, the needle is inserted through the buccinator above the level of the occlusal surface of the molar teeth and in front of the pterygomandibular raphe, which raises a visible and palpable ridge in the opened mouth, just behind the (palpable) internal oblique ridge of the mandibular ramus (Fig. 8.14, p. 664). The line of approach is from the premolar teeth of the opposite side, and a small injection is made 0.5 cm from the surface, when the needle is above the lingual nerve; the main injection is made another 1 cm deeper above the lingula, where the inferior alveolar nerve enters the mandibular foramen.</p><p>The teeth of the upper jaw lie in a continuous curve.</p><h4 id=deciduous-dentition>Deciduous Dentition
<a class=anchor href=#deciduous-dentition>#</a></h4><p>The deciduous, or milk, teeth begin to erupt at about the sixth month and are completely erupted at the end of the second year. They consist of 5 teeth in each half-jaw, 20 in all. There are 2 incisors, 1 canine and 2 molars. They are shed as the permanent teeth erupt. Note that the deciduous molars are replaced by the permanent premolars, not by permanent molars which have no counterpart in the deciduous dentition.</p><h4 id=development-and-eruption-of-teeth>Development and Eruption of Teeth
<a class=anchor href=#development-and-eruption-of-teeth>#</a></h4><p>Teeth are derived by budding of the epithelium (ectoderm) lining the mouth. The buds of ectoderm produce only the enamel; they evoke a reaction in the surrounding mesoderm, which differentiates to produce the dentine and cementum.</p><p>In the mouth cavity (stomodeum) of the 5-week embryo [12 mm (½ inch) long] an ingrowth of ectoderm occurs over the site of the future gums. A curved sheet of ectoderm grows into the adjacent mesoderm, tilting medially. This is the primary dental lamina. From its outer surface a series of buds grow into the mesoderm - one for each deciduous tooth. At a later stage a similar series of buds grow (more medially) from the depths of the primary dental lamina - one bud for each permanent tooth. These epithelial buds are the tooth germs and when they are well formed the primary dental lamina becomes absorbed. Remnants of this epithelium may later grow into cysts or tumours.</p><p>The tooth germs grow away from the mouth surface into a wineglass-shaped mass, attached by its stalk to the primary dental lamina. This mass is the enamel organ. Its surface epithelium becomes columnar; the cells lining the concavity are ameloblasts which produce enamel. The epithelium of the rest of the enamel organ takes on a different appearance; its cells develop long branching processes and fluid separates them. From this appearance the mass is known as the stellate reticulum. After the ameloblasts commence to secrete enamel the stellate reticulum undergoes atrophy. Beyond the stellate reticulum the enamel organ is prolonged as an epithelial sheath around the root.</p><p>The mesoderm within the cavity of the wineglass-shaped enamel organ is evoked to differentiate into the dental papilla. Its surface cells become the columnar odontoblasts which produce dentine.</p><p>The ameloblasts (ectodermal) lining the concavity of the enamel organ and the odontoblasts (mesodermal) covering the convexity of the dental papilla lie in contact. Though the ameloblasts were there first, so to speak, it is the odontoblasts that become active first, producing dentine and, later, the ameloblasts produce enamel. As the two substances accumulate, the secreting cells are pushed further away from the amelodentinal junction. Around the root the dentine is contained by the epithelial sheath prolonged down from the enamel organ.</p><p>The mesoderm of the dental papilla persists as the pulp of the tooth, surrounded by the dentine it has secreted.</p><p>Cementum is produced in the mesoderm outside the dentine of the root. The process is comparable to membranous ossification. As the cementum is formed the epithelial sheath around the dentine is absorbed and the cementum becomes firmly bound to the dentine of the root.</p><p>The crown of the tooth is fully formed before eruption, but the root is only one-third formed. At this stage the tooth lies within a fibrous tissue condensation within the bone of the jaw, the dental follicle, and in the permanent teeth it communicates by a tiny orifice with the surface of the bone. The fibrous tissue in this orifice is the gubernaculum.</p><p>The tooth erupts by a combination of elongation of the root and absorption of the overlying bone. The elongating root is ensheathed in an upgrowth of alveolar bone.</p><p>The normal times of eruption are:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Tooth Type</th><th>Eruption Age</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Central Incisor</td><td>6-8 months</td></tr><tr><td>Lateral Incisor</td><td>8-10 months</td></tr><tr><td>First Molar</td><td>12-16 months</td></tr><tr><td>Canine</td><td>16-20 months</td></tr><tr><td>Second Molar</td><td>20-30 months</td></tr></tbody></table><p>A lower tooth precedes its opposite number in the upper jaw. The first permanent molar (the 6-year molar) erupts before any deciduous teeth have been shed. The second permanent molar does not erupt until 12 years of age. In the intervening period the five deciduous teeth in each half-jaw are replaced. The order of replacement is first the incisors, central and lateral, then the milk molars, first and second and, last of all, the long-rooted canine.</p><h2 id=palate>Palate
<a class=anchor href=#palate>#</a></h2><p>The palate is the roof of the mouth. Between the teeth it lies on a basis of bone, the hard palate. Behind the teeth and hard palate the soft palate projects down.</p><h3 id=hard-palate>Hard Palate
<a class=anchor href=#hard-palate>#</a></h3><p>The hard palate is made up of the palatal process of the maxilla and the horizontal plate of the palatine bone. (The part of the maxilla that bears the incisor teeth probably represents the mammalian premaxilla.) In the midline at the front of the hard palate lies the incisive fossa, into which open the incisive foramina (the ends of the incisive canals). The greater palatine foramen lies between the palatine bone and maxilla, level with the last molar tooth; the lesser palatine foramina, just behind it, perforate the palatine bone itself.</p><p>The mucous membrane of the front of the hard palate is strongly united with the periosteum and the two cannot be stripped apart. Together they can be readily stripped from the bone; these combined layers are the mucoperiosteum. The attachment of the periosteum to the bone is secured by multiple fibrous tissue pegs (Sharpey&rsquo;s fibres) that leave a finely pitted bone surface on the dried skull. This fixation of the mucous membrane is for mastication; the moving bolus does not displace the mucous membrane. There are transverse masticatory ridges in this part of the mucoperiosteum. Over the horizontal plate of the palatine bone mucous membrane and periosteum are separated by a mass of mucous gland tissue; no large Sharpey&rsquo;s fibres are needed here, and the bone surface is smoothly polished. From between these areas the mucous membrane curves down to the under surface of the soft palate.</p><p><strong>Blood supply.</strong> By the greater palatine artery, which emerges from the greater palatine foramen and passes around the palate (lateral to the nerve) to enter the incisive foramen and pass up into the nose. Veins accompany the artery back to the pterygoid plexus. Other veins pass back to the supratonsillar region and join the pharyngeal plexus.</p><p><strong>Lymph drainage.</strong> To retropharyngeal and deep cervical lymph nodes.</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> By the greater palatine nerve (from the maxillary via the pterygopalatine ganglion) as far forward as the incisive foramen. The anterior part of the palate, behind the incisor teeth (the area of the premaxilla), is supplied by the two nasopalatine nerves, from the same source.</p><p><strong>Development of the palate.</strong> See page 41. The soft palate belongs to both the mouth and the pharynx. It forms the posterior sloping part of the roof of the mouth and part of the anterior wall of the pharynx. Because its musculature is more intimately connected with the pharynx than with the mouth it is more conveniently described with the pharynx (p. 491).</p><h2 id=tongue>Tongue
<a class=anchor href=#tongue>#</a></h2><p>The tongue is essentially a mass of skeletal muscle mostly covered by mucous membrane, and with a midline fibrous septum separating the two muscular halves. The main parts are the dorsum, tip, inferior surface and root. The dorsum faces in two directions: its anterior two-thirds or oral part upwards towards the hard palate, and its posterior one-third or pharyngeal part (sometimes called the base) backwards, forming the anterior wall of the oral part of the pharynx. The tip is the most anterior and most mobile part and merges into the inferior surface. The mucous membrane of this inferior surface and of the floor of the mouth is thin and smooth, similar to that of the cheek; it projects as a midline flange, the frenulum, beneath the tip of the tongue. The mucous membrane on the oral and pharyngeal parts has different developmental origins and surface appearances, and each has a different function; the oral part grips for chewing and the pharyngeal part is smooth for swallowing.</p><p>The posterior third of the tongue (postsulcal part) is really part of the pharynx, but it is obviously convenient to study it with the rest of the organ as part of the mouth. It extends from the sulcus terminalis to the epiglottis. At the apex of the sulcus is a small depression, the foramen caecum, which is the remains of the upper end of the thyroglossal duct (thyroid diverticulum, p. 39). There are no papillae behind the sulcus. The smooth mucous membrane has a nodular appearance from the presence of underlying masses of mucous and serous glands and aggregations of lymphoid follicles. The latter constitute the lingual tonsil, part of Waldeyer&rsquo;s ring (p. 490). This posterior part of the tongue, like the soft palate above it, is coated with mucus from its multiple glands and makes a smooth and slippery surface for swallowing. Between the tongue and epiglottis a midline flange of mucous membrane is raised up between the two as the median glossoepiglottic fold. From each side of the epiglottis a similar mucosal fold extends laterally to the wall of the pharynx as the lateral glossoepiglottic fold, but this is a misnomer because it is not attached to the tongue and would be better named pharyngoepiglottic. Its framework is fibrous tissue joining the epiglottis to the greater horn of the hyoid bone. The three folds enclose the two valleculae, shallow oval pits behind and below the posterior end of the tongue.</p><p>When the tip of the tongue is raised to the roof of the mouth, the inferior surface of the tongue can be inspected. A small midline septum of mucous membrane (lingual frenulum) unites it to the floor of the mouth. Lateral to this the deep lingual vein can usually be seen through the mucosa (the lingual artery and nerve that are near it are not visible), and farther laterally still is another fold of mucosa, the fimbriated fold.</p><p>The palatoglossal arches (formerly called the anterior pillars of the fauces) are ridges of mucous membrane raised up by the palatoglossus muscles (see below). They extend from the under surface of the front of the soft palate to the sides of the tongue at the vallate papillae. The whole constitutes the oropharyngeal isthmus. In front of it is the mouth, behind it is the pharynx; and it is narrower than either. It is closed by depression of the palate and elevation of the dorsum of the tongue, and narrowed by contraction of the palatoglossus muscles.</p><p>The muscles of the tongue are divided into intrinsic and extrinsic groups; the intrinsic muscles are wholly within the tongue and not attached to bone, while the extrinsic muscles have a bony attachment. There are four muscles in each group in each half of the tongue, with a midline fibrous septum dividing the organ into two symmetrical halves. The muscles of the intrinsic group are the superior and inferior longitudinal, transverse and vertical, and the extrinsic group comprises genioglossus (which is the largest of all the muscles and makes up the bulk of the tongue), hyoglossus, styloglossus and palatoglossus. From their names it is apparent that the extrinsic muscles have attachments to the hyoid bone, hard palate and styloid process, but it should be noted that genioglossus might be better named geniohyoglossus since it is attached to the hyoid bone as well as to the mandible.</p><h3 id=genioglossus>Genioglossus
<a class=anchor href=#genioglossus>#</a></h3><p>Genioglossus arises from the superior mental spine (formerly the genial tubercle), whence the fibres radiate widely to be inserted into the mucous membrane of the tongue, with the lowest fibres passing down to the hyoid bone.</p><h3 id=hyoglossus>Hyoglossus
<a class=anchor href=#hyoglossus>#</a></h3><p>Hyoglossus arises from the length of the greater horn of the hyoid bone and from its body lateral to geniohyoid. It extends upwards as a thin quadrilateral sheet; its upper border, interdigitating at right angles with the fibres of styloglossus, is attached to the side of the tongue. Its anterior and posterior borders are free.</p><p>The muscle is a key structure for the side of the tongue, and its posterior border in particular is an important landmark in dissections, especially when the body of the mandible has been removed (Fig. 6.17). Superficial (lateral) to the muscle from above downwards lie the lingual nerve, submandibular duct and hypoglossal nerve, while passing deep to its posterior border from above downwards are the glossopharyngeal nerve, stylohyoid ligament and lingual artery (p. 484).</p><h3 id=styloglossus>Styloglossus
<a class=anchor href=#styloglossus>#</a></h3><p>Styloglossus arises from the front of the lower part of the styloid process and the upper part of the stylohyoid ligament. It passes forwards below the superior constrictor to be inserted into the side of the tongue, interdigitating with the upper fibres of hyoglossus. The glossopharyngeal nerve curves parallel with its lower border on a slightly deeper plane.</p><h3 id=palatoglossus>Palatoglossus
<a class=anchor href=#palatoglossus>#</a></h3><p>Palatoglossus descends from the under surface of the palatine aponeurosis to the side of the tongue, forming with its fellow of the opposite side the palatoglossal arch (see above), which is the dividing line between mouth and pharynx. It is described further with the soft palate (p. 494).</p><h3 id=blood-supply-4>Blood Supply
<a class=anchor href=#blood-supply-4>#</a></h3><p>The tongue is supplied by the lingual artery (p. 437), which runs above the greater horn of the hyoid bone deep to hyoglossus and passes forwards to the tip. Beneath hyoglossus it gives off dorsal lingual branches into the posterior part. At the anterior border of hyoglossus it gives a branch to the sublingual gland and the floor of the mouth. There are small contributions from the tonsillar branch of the facial artery and from the ascending pharyngeal artery. The fibrous septum dividing the two halves of the tongue prevents any significant anastomosis of blood vessels across the midline.</p><p>Venous tributaries accompanying the lingual artery and its dorsal branches form the lingual vein. The venous return from the tip is by the deep lingual vein, visible on each side of the midline on the under surface. It runs back superficial to hyoglossus and is joined at the anterior border of that muscle by the sublingual vein (from the sublingual gland) to form the vena comitans of the hypoglossal nerve. It continues backwards close to the nerve and has a variable ending, joining either the lingual, facial or internal jugular veins. The lingual vein usually joins the internal jugular near the greater horn of the hyoid bone.</p><h3 id=lymph-drainage-3>Lymph Drainage
<a class=anchor href=#lymph-drainage-3>#</a></h3><p>The most significant feature of the tongue&rsquo;s lymph drainage (Fig. 6.24), which is through the floor of the mouth, is that lymph from one side, especially of the posterior part, may reach nodes of both sides of the neck (in contrast to the blood supply which remains unilateral). However, this contralateral flow usually only occurs when the ipsilateral channels have become obstructed. The tip is said to drain to submental nodes but these are rarely affected by lingual disease in this part. The rest of the anterior part drains to submandibular nodes (Fig. 6.24), and then to nodes of both the upper and lower end of the deep cervical group. The posterior part drains directly to deep cervical nodes.</p><h3 id=nerve-supply-3>Nerve Supply
<a class=anchor href=#nerve-supply-3>#</a></h3><p>All the muscles of the tongue, intrinsic and extrinsic, are supplied by the hypoglossal nerve (except palatoglossus, which, being essentially a palate muscle, is supplied by the pharyngeal plexus, p. 495). The motor cell bodies are in the hypoglossal nucleus, below the hypoglossal trigone in the medullary part of the floor of the fourth ventricle (p. 614). The pathway of proprioceptive impulses from the tongue is probably via the lingual nerve.</p><p>Contrary to the most common statements on the subject, the sensory supply of the mucous membrane of the tongue is from three nerves, not two (because the mucosa is developed from three pharyngeal arches - see below). The oral part (presulcal, anterior two-thirds), but not the region of the vallate papillae, is supplied by the lingual nerve, whose trigeminal component mediates common sensibility (with cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglion) and whose chorda tympani component mediates taste (with cell bodies in the genicular ganglion of the facial nerve). The parasympathetic secretomotor fibres to the anterior lingual gland run in the chorda tympani from the superior salivary nucleus, and relay in the submandibular ganglion.</p><p>The posterior one-third of the mucosa, together with the presulcal area that includes the vallate papillae, is mainly supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve. This has fibres of both common sensibility and taste (with cell bodies in the glossopharyngeal ganglia in the jugular foramen), and carries parasympathetic secretomotor fibres to the mucosal glands (with relay in lingual ganglia within the mucosa). A small area of lingual mucosa forming the anterior wall of the vallecula is supplied by the nerve of the vallecular mucosa, the internal laryngeal (with cell bodies in the inferior vagal ganglion). Thus the mucous membrane in the region of the vallate papillae, which lies in front of the sulcus terminalis and therefore in the oral (presulcal) part, is supplied by the main nerve of the pharyngeal (postsulcal) part, the glossopharyngeal. This can be explained by the forward migration of epithelium from the postsulcal part during development. There is no landmark on the dorsal surface of the tongue to indicate where lingual and glossopharyngeal supplies meet. For the explanation of these nerve supplies, see below.</p><p>Vasoconstrictor sympathetic fibres travel with the lingual artery from the external carotid plexus; their cell bodies are in the superior cervical ganglion.</p><h3 id=structure-4>Structure
<a class=anchor href=#structure-4>#</a></h3><p>The substance of the tongue is composed of fibres of striated muscle lying for the most part in three planes at right angles to each other. Mucous and serous glands are abundant in the posterior part. Lymphoid follicles occur here and constitute the lingual tonsil; there are none in the anterior part. The surface is covered by a stratified squamous epithelium which, in the mouth part, is projected into papillae.</p><p>The filiform papillae are by no means threadlike, but project as truncated cones whose flat tops are covered with keratin. The appearance of the protruded tongue depends on the state of the keratin. When there is little keratin (as after chewing roughage) the tongue is a healthy pink. When the keratin is thick (as from lack of chewing in illness, starvation) it becomes white by maceration (washerwoman&rsquo;s fingers). Keratin dries after mouth breathing and is then brown in colour. The fungiform papillae are so scanty as to be seldom seen in random sections of the tongue; they have a slender base and bulbous tip which is not keratinized. A vallate papilla consists of a cylindrical mass about 2 mm in diameter surrounded by a deep slit, both walls of which contain taste buds. The ducts of serous glands open into the base of the slit, to wash it out ready to taste the next arrival.</p><p>Taste buds lie as spherical masses entirely within the epithelium; they are seldom seen except in the walls of vallate papillae, where they abound. A taste bud is made up of slender, spindle-shaped, pale cells some of which are the receptor cells. It opens on the surface by a tiny gustatory pore.</p><h3 id=movements>Movements
<a class=anchor href=#movements>#</a></h3><p>The tongue is used in sucking, in prehension of food, in chewing, in swallowing and in speaking. It is also used in toilet (licking the lips in man, licking the fur in animals) and occasionally in gesture. Its moist fur makes an excellent damping pad for licking.</p><p>The intrinsic muscles alter the shape of the tongue, the extrinsic muscles stabilize the organ and by their contraction alter its position, as well as its shape. The tongue rests on the floor of the mouth (p. 428) and this highly mobile shelf greatly enhances the mobility of the tongue.</p><p>The transversus muscle narrows the tongue and consequently heaps up the dorsum into a side to side convexity. With simultaneous contraction of the vertical muscle this convexity is flattened and, since the total volume of the tongue remains constant, the organ becomes elongated and pointed at the tip. If now the lowest fibres of genioglossus contract the back of the tongue is drawn forwards, i.e. the pointed tongue is extruded.</p><p>Contraction of the longitudinal fibres shortens the tongue, which then becomes concave from front to back. Contraction of the vertical fibres produces a midline groove with consequent heaping up of the sides of the tongue, as in the first stage of swallowing.</p><p>The essential point is that the tongue volume remains constant. Therefore shortening of some fibres can only occur if others passively elongate; this results in change of shape.</p><p>It has already been pointed out that the lowest fibres of genioglossus draw the tongue forward. Styloglossus opposes this movement and retracts the organ. Hyoglossus draws the sides of the tongue downwards.</p><p>The tongue rests on the mylohyoid muscles, on which the tongue rests. The mobile floor of the mouth can be elongated or shortened, raised or lowered, thus still further altering the position of an already mobile organ (see below).</p><p>The movements of the tongue in the first (voluntary) stage of swallowing illustrate its mobility. Contraction of the vertical intrinsic muscle makes a longitudinal groove on the dorsum; the heaped-up tip and edges are in contact with the hard palate and teeth. The liquid or moist bolus is thus imprisoned in the groove. Contraction of mylohyoid now raises the floor of the mouth, compressing the tongue against the hard palate. The vertical intrinsic fibres relax from before backwards; pressure from the contracting mylohyoid muscle obliterates the groove in the same sequence, forcing the bolus backwards (Fig. 6.42). It is more difficult to swallow a single bolus with the mouth open; but it is still possible. While drinking from a vessel the lips and teeth remain open and the tongue spills no liquid during swallowing. The tongue is mobile enough to perform almost any movement.</p><h3 id=development-4>Development
<a class=anchor href=#development-4>#</a></h3><p>Tongue muscles are derived from suboccipital myotomes (cranial to the first cervical segment) which migrate forwards into a sac of mucous membrane, carrying their nerve supply with them (hypoglossal nerve). The migration passes ventrally around the internal and external carotid arteries, but medial to the internal jugular vein. The epithelium (and glands) are derived from the lining of the floor of the pharynx (p. 37), and come from parts of the first, third and fourth arches, hence there are three sensory nerve supplies. The presulcal mucosa comes from the midline tuberculum impar and the pair of lateral lingual swellings of the first arch (lingual and chorda tympani nerves p. 38); the postsulcal part is from the midline hypobranchial eminence of the third arch (glossopharyngeal nerve), with a small contribution from the fourth arch (internal laryngeal nerve). Tissue of the second arch is not represented because third arch tissue overgrows it in a forward direction to meet that from the first arch. The thyroid diverticulum grows downwards from the junction between the tuberculum impar and the hypobranchial eminence, the site being indicated by the foramen caecum.</p><h2 id=floor-of-the-mouth>Floor of the Mouth
<a class=anchor href=#floor-of-the-mouth>#</a></h2><p>The muscles of the floor of the mouth are the two mylohyoids (described on p. 428) with the pair of geniohyoids (p. 429) lying above them adjacent to the midline anteriorly. Above the mylohyoids lies the mouth; below it lies the neck. The tongue (described above) occupies much of the floor, and below its tip and sides is the sublingual region. At the front the mucous membrane passes from side to side, covering the sublingual glands (which raise the sublingual folds) and the upper borders of the mandibular attachments of the genioglossi. At the sides the mucosa is reflected from the upper part of mylohyoid to styloglossus and hyoglossus, and covers the lingual artery as it enters the mouth below the superior constrictor.</p><p>Mylohyoid (p. 428) slopes down from the mylohyoid line of the mandible into a midline raphe; only its posterior fibres are inserted into the body of the hyoid bone. The arrangement resembles that of the levator ani in the pelvic floor. An important difference is that the raphe of the pelvic floor is attached behind to a fixed bone (the tip of the coccyx) whereas the mylohyoid raphe is attached behind to the mobile hyoid bone. The hyoid bone can be moved up and down, forwards and backwards; thus the floor of the mouth is much more mobile than the pelvic floor. This contributes a greater mobility to the already very mobile tongue.</p><p>The hyoid bone is slung between mandible and styloid process by the geniohyoid and stylohyoid muscles; their reciprocal contractions determine the anteroposterior position of the hyoid bone. They lengthen or shorten the floor of the mouth, the mylohyoid raphe being passively lengthened or shortened, like a concertina. Both muscles slope down to the hyoid, as does the mylohyoid; these three muscles elevate the hyoid bone. The infrahyoid muscles depress the hyoid bone; the reciprocal contractions of these groups determine the vertical level of the hyoid bone.</p><p>Lying on mylohyoid is the mass of the tongue. Between the two are the geniohyoids near the anterior midline and laterally the hyoglossus muscle (Fig. 6.17). Hyoglossus and mylohyoid pass upwards from the hyoid bone, the former to the side of the tongue, the latter to the mylohyoid line of the mandible. The structures in the angular interval between them are shown in Figure 6.25.</p><h3 id=submandibular-duct>Submandibular Duct
<a class=anchor href=#submandibular-duct>#</a></h3><p>The submandibular duct passes forwards from the superficial part of the gland (p. 436). It opens on the sublingual papilla, a low elevation on the floor of the mouth at the side of the frenulum of the tongue.</p><h3 id=hypoglossal-nerve-1>Hypoglossal Nerve
<a class=anchor href=#hypoglossal-nerve-1>#</a></h3><p>The hypoglossal nerve passes forwards on the lower border of hyoglossus, just above the greater horn of the hyoid bone (Fig. 6.17). At the anterior border of hyoglossus the round nerve trunk becomes flattened and breaks up into a number of branches that radiate into the muscles of the tongue. Geniohyoid receives a branch containing C1 fibres only. There is always a communication between the hypoglossal and lingual nerves, and perhaps this carries proprioceptive impulses from the muscles. The nerve is accompanied by a companion vein that drains the front of the tongue (p. 482).</p><h3 id=lingual-nerve>Lingual Nerve
<a class=anchor href=#lingual-nerve>#</a></h3><p>The lingual nerve enters the mouth from outside the pharynx by passing below the inferior border of the superior constrictor at its attachment to the mandible, at the lower end of the pterygomandibular raphe (Fig. 6.26A). The nerve lies against the periosteum of the mandible at the posterior border of the third molar tooth, and runs forward on the upper surface of mylohyoid muscle (Fig. 6.26A and B). It gives off a gingival branch that runs deep to the interval between the sublingual gland and the mandible and supplies all the lingual gum and mucous membrane of the adjoining sulcus to the midline. The lingual nerve then dips under the submandibular duct and runs forward on the surface of hyoglossus above the level of the duct (Fig. 6.17). The nerve here is flattened rather than round. It is distributed to the mucous membrane of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.</p><h3 id=submandibular-ganglion>Submandibular Ganglion
<a class=anchor href=#submandibular-ganglion>#</a></h3><p>The submandibular ganglion hangs suspended from the lingual nerve, on the surface of hyoglossus below the submandibular duct (Fig. 6.17). It is a relay station for the parasympathetic secretomotor fibres in the chorda tympani. Postganglionic fibres supply the sublingual and submandibular glands (with a few fibres to the submandibular gland relaying in cell bodies in the hilum of the gland). For the connections of the ganglion see page 34.</p><h3 id=structures-deep-to-hyoglossus>Structures Deep to Hyoglossus
<a class=anchor href=#structures-deep-to-hyoglossus>#</a></h3><p>Three structures lie deep to hyoglossus muscle (p. 482). The lingual artery passes deep to the posterior border of the muscle and runs forward above the greater horn of the hyoid bone (level with the hypoglossal nerve on the superficial side of the muscle) (Fig. 6.25). Dorsal branches are given off deep to the muscle and the lingual artery passes forward from beneath the anterior border of hyoglossus to reach the front of the tongue.</p><p>The glossopharyngeal nerve disappears beneath the upper part of hyoglossus (Fig. 6.17). It is much thinner than the hypoglossal nerve. It is distributed, like the dorsal lingual arteries, to the mucous membrane of the posterior third of the tongue and to the vallate papillae.</p><p>The stylohyoid ligament runs down from the tip of the styloid process to the lesser horn of the hyoid bone (Fig. 6.28). From the angle between the ligament and the greater horn the middle constrictor fibres arise (p. 487) and emerge from beneath the posterior border of hyoglossus to fan out around the pharynx.</p><h3 id=sublingual-gland>Sublingual Gland
<a class=anchor href=#sublingual-gland>#</a></h3><p>The sublingual gland is almond-shaped and lies in front of the anterior border of hyoglossus, between mylohyoid below and in front and the side of the tongue (genioglossus) medially. Laterally it lies against the sublingual fossa of the mandible (Fig. 8.14, p. 664). Its upper surface raises the sublingual fold in the floor of the mouth. At the front the two glands almost meet each other; at the back each is separated from the submandibular gland by the stylomandibular ligament. The gland is mucus-secreting (see the parotid gland for a note on structure, p. 457), and of its 15 or so ducts, half open directly into the submandibular duct, the remainder separately on the sublingual fold.</p><p>It is supplied by the lingual artery and by branches of the submental artery which pierce mylohyoid muscle to reach it. The venous return is by corresponding veins. It is innervated from the submandibular ganglion (see above).</p><h2 id=pharynx>Pharynx
<a class=anchor href=#pharynx>#</a></h2><p>The pharynx is a fibromuscular tube applied to the back of the face in the same way as a respirator is applied to the front of the face. Its anterior wall is largely deficient so that it has wide communication with the nose, mouth and larynx. It extends downwards for about 12 cm (5 in) from the base of the skull to the level of C6 vertebra, where it becomes continuous with the oesophagus. Both pharynx and oesophagus are in contact posteriorly with the prevertebral fascia, which provides a foundation upon which pharynx and oesophagus can freely slide during swallowing and movements of the neck. The dead space between the pharynx and the prevertebral fascia not only allows for free mobility of the pharynx and oesophagus, but also permits the extension of infection from one side to the other of the neck. It continues below into the posterior mediastinum.</p><p>Because of its anterior communications it is descriptively divided into three parts - nasal, oral and laryngeal, often known respectively as the nasopharynx, oropharynx and laryngopharynx, each with distinctive interior features. Its wall throughout consists of four layers which from within outwards are the mucous membrane, submucous layer (or fibrous layer), muscular layer and finally the very thin and unimportant buccopharyngeal fascia which covers the muscular layer externally.</p><p>The muscular wall is surprisingly thin. It consists of three curved sheets of muscle, the superior, middle and inferior constrictors (supplemented by three smaller muscles: stylopharyngeus, palatopharyngeus and salpingopharyngeus). They overlap posteriorly, being telescoped into each other like three stacked cups. But the muscle does not extend up to the base of the skull; here the immobile wall of the nasopharynx consists of a rigid membrane, the pharyngobasilar fascia. This is simply a dense thickening of the submucosa that fills in the gap between the skull and the upper border of the superior constrictor. The thickening can be traced down to the level of the soft palate, making a fourth but fibrous cup stacked inside the other three. Its stiffness keeps the nasopharynx always open for breathing, and food does not enter it. Before considering the pharyngeal musculature it is helpful to study the attachments of this fascia, after first making a general survey of the external surface of the base of the skull (p. 648).</p><p>Start from the pharyngeal tubercle, to which is attached a midline thickening, the pharyngeal raphe, which receives fibres from the constrictor muscles. The attachment of the fascia then passes laterally, convex forwards over longus capitis and the back part of the foramen lacerum to the petrous part of the temporal bone just in front of the carotid canal. From this point its attachment is to the cartilaginous part of the auditory tube, not to the skull. Below the orifice of the auditory tube it is attached to the sharp posterior border of the medial pterygoid plate, down to the hamulus. Suspended from the base of the skull, and sweeping around from one medial pterygoid plate to the other, reinforced posteriorly by the pharyngeal raphe, the pharyngobasilar fascia makes a rigid wall that holds the nasopharynx permanently open for breathing. The lower edge of the pharyngobasilar fascia lies at the site of Passavant&rsquo;s ridge, level with the hard palate, inside the superior constrictor muscle. The ridge (p. 494) acts like a purse-string on the lower free margin of the pharyngobasilar fascia. Below this the mucous membrane lies on a loose submucosa.</p><p>Note that the quadrangular area at the apex of the petrous bone in front of the carotid canal lies within a lateral recess of the pharynx. The levator palati muscle arises here; it is entirely intrapharyngeal, being covered medially by mucous membrane. Note too that the cartilaginous part of the auditory tube enters the nasopharynx above the pharyngobasilar fascia, which is firmly attached to it (Fig. 8.4, p. 646).</p><h3 id=superior-constrictor>Superior Constrictor
<a class=anchor href=#superior-constrictor>#</a></h3><p>Examine the skull again. Note that the upper third of the posterior border of the medial pterygoid plate is more rounded and blunter to the touch than the lower part. It is rather concave, for it lodges the free end of the tubal cartilage. This border now gives way to a spur, below which the posterior border of the medial pterygoid plate is sharp to the examining finger. The superior constrictor fibres arise below the tube, in continuity from the spur along the whole of the sharp two-thirds of the posterior border, down to and including the tip of the hamulus. The muscle fibres lie outside the pharyngobasilar fascia as they share this attachment to the edge of the medial pterygoid plate. The pharyngobasilar fascia ends at the hamulus, but the origin of the superior constrictor continues down along the pterygomandibular raphe (which runs from the hamulus to the posterior end of the mylohyoid line) to the mandible just above the attachment of the raphe, at the level of the posterior border of the last molar tooth. The superior constrictor passes backwards from the pterygomandibular raphe; buccinator passes forwards from it (Fig. 6.11).</p><p>From its origins (medial pterygoid plate, hamulus, raphe and mandible) the muscle sweeps around the pharynx, its fibres diverging mostly upwards to meet their opposite fellows at the midline pharyngeal raphe. The upper end of this raphe forms a rather prominent fibrous band which receives the uppermost constrictor fibres and is attached to the pharyngeal tubercle. The lowest fibres extend as far down as the level of the vocal folds, lying within the middle constrictor. Note that there is a space between the upper border of the superior constrictor and the base of the skull. Through here passes the cartilaginous part of the auditory tube and the rest of the space is closed by the firm pharyngobasilar fascia (Fig. 6.27).</p><p>There is a gap laterally between the superior and middle constrictors (Fig. 6.28). This is plugged by the back of the tongue and traversed by structures that pass from outside the pharynx to inside the mouth, namely stylopharyngeus (p. 489), the glossopharyngeal nerve (p. 485) and the lingual nerve (p. 485).</p><h3 id=middle-constrictor>Middle Constrictor
<a class=anchor href=#middle-constrictor>#</a></h3><p>The stylohyoid ligament is attached to the lesser horn of the hyoid bone deep to hyoglossus. From the angle between it and the greater horn arises the middle constrictor, its fibres diverging widely as they sweep around the pharynx to end in the median raphe. The uppermost fibres reach the raphe and enclose the superior constrictor; the lower arch down as far as the level of the vocal folds. They enclose the superior constrictor and are themselves enclosed within the inferior constrictor (Fig. 6.28).</p><p>The gap between the middle and inferior constrictors is closed by the thyrohyoid membrane (p. 498), which joins the hyoid bone to the thyroid cartilage (Fig. 6.28) and walls in the laryngeal part of the pharynx at the piriform recess (p. 491). Passing through this gap by piercing the membrane are the internal laryngeal nerve and superior laryngeal vessels.</p><h3 id=inferior-constrictor>Inferior Constrictor
<a class=anchor href=#inferior-constrictor>#</a></h3><p>This has two parts, named from their origins (Fig. 6.28). The thyropharyngeus part arises from the oblique line of the thyroid cartilage and in continuity below this from a fibrous arch that spans the cricothyroid muscle. It encloses the middle and superior constrictors as its fibres curve around to the midline raphe. The fibres diverge widely, sweeping up to the pharyngeal raphe with some almost reaching the pharyngeal tubercle. The lower fibres are horizontal, edge to edge with cricopharyngeus, the second part. The cricopharyngeus, rounded and thicker than the flat sheets of the other constrictors, extends uninterruptedly from one side of the cricoid arch to the other, around the pharynx. There is no raphe here. The muscle acts as a sphincter at the lower extent of the pharynx, and is continuous with the circular muscular coat of the oesophagus. It is composed largely of fibres of the slow twitch variety without spindles (like the external urethral sphincter, p. 406) and is always closed, except for momentary relaxation during deglutition, and it usually has a different nerve supply from the other constrictors (see below). It imparts some resistance to the passage of an endoscope (overcome by swallowing). The closure of the cricopharyngeus prevents air from being sucked into the upper oesophagus when intrathoracic pressure falls; air is sucked only into the permanently open trachea. Passing upwards deep to the lower border of the inferior constrictor are the recurrent laryngeal nerve and inferior laryngeal vessels.</p><p>The outer surface of the pharynx is covered by the delicate epimysium of the pharyngeal constrictors. This thin tissue is continuous over the pterygomandibular raphe with the epimysium over buccinator, so it has been called the buccopharyngeal fascia. It is unworthy of mention except to emphasize that it must not be confused with the tough and important pharyngobasilar fascia (p. 487).</p><p>The junction between thyropharyngeus and cricopharyngeus near the midline is a potentially weak area of the pharyngeal wall, and through this area (Killian&rsquo;s dehiscence) a pouch of mucosa may become protruded (pharyngeal diverticulum). As it enlarges the pouch hangs down at the side of the oesophagus, and although it may be called an oesophageal diverticulum the origin is above the cricopharyngeus. Such diverticula are normal in some species (e.g. the pig).</p><h3 id=palatopharyngeus>Palatopharyngeus
<a class=anchor href=#palatopharyngeus>#</a></h3><p>Palatopharyngeus is described with the soft palate (p. 494). Here it should be noted that from their palatal origin the muscle fibres pass down internal to the superior constrictor (Fig. 6.30).</p><h3 id=salpingopharyngeus>Salpingopharyngeus
<a class=anchor href=#salpingopharyngeus>#</a></h3><p>Salpingopharyngeus is a very slender muscle that arises from the lower part of the cartilage of the auditory tube (p. 531) and runs downwards (Fig. 6.30) to blend with palatopharyngeus.</p><h3 id=stylopharyngeus>Stylopharyngeus
<a class=anchor href=#stylopharyngeus>#</a></h3><p>Stylopharyngeus arises from the deep aspect of the styloid process high up. It slopes down across the internal carotid artery, in front of which it crosses the lower border of the superior constrictor and passes down inside the middle constrictor (Fig. 6.27). Here it lies behind palatopharyngeus and is inserted into the posterior border of the thyroid lamina and the side wall of the pharynx. The glossopharyngeal nerve curls round the posterior border of the muscle from medial to lateral, and supplies it.</p><h3 id=blood-supply-5>Blood Supply
<a class=anchor href=#blood-supply-5>#</a></h3><p>Branches of many arteries take blood to the pharynx: ascending pharyngeal, ascending palatine, lingual, tonsillar, greater palatine, the artery of the pterygoid canal, and the superior and inferior laryngeal arteries. Venous blood is largely collected into the pharyngeal venous plexus which like the nerve plexus (see below) is situated at the back of the middle constrictor; it drains to the pterygoid plexus or directly into the internal jugular vein. From the lowest part blood finds its way to the inferior thyroid veins.</p><h3 id=lymph-drainage-4>Lymph Drainage
<a class=anchor href=#lymph-drainage-4>#</a></h3><p>Lymph passes to retropharyngeal lymph nodes and via these or directly to upper and lower deep cervical groups.</p><h3 id=nerve-supply-4>Nerve Supply
<a class=anchor href=#nerve-supply-4>#</a></h3><p>The mucosa of the nasopharynx is supplied from the maxillary nerve through the pterygopalatine ganglion, whose pharyngeal branch reaches the nasopharynx via the palatovaginal canal. Most of the oropharynx receives its sensory supply from the glossopharyngeal nerve, but the vallecula is supplied by the internal laryngeal nerve, and all the rest of the pharyngeal mucosa is innervated by the internal and recurrent laryngeal nerves.</p><p>Just as the blank and windowless wall of a tall building gives no impression of the floors and furnishing within, so inspection of the outside of the pharynx gives no hint of its division into nasal, oral and pharyngeal parts. The interior of the nasal and oral parts is understood better after the soft palate has been studied, and the laryngeal part after considering the larynx; the description that follows should be referred to again after dealing with those structures (pp. 491 and 496).</p><h3 id=nasopharynx>Nasopharynx
<a class=anchor href=#nasopharynx>#</a></h3><p>This, commonly called the nasopharynx, extends from the base of the skull to the lower border of the soft palate (Fig. 6.21). The rigid pharyngobasilar fascia keeps it from collapsing at the back and sides. At the front the upper part communicates with the nose through the choanae, while below this the soft palate forms its anterior wall (Fig. 6.30). The space between the lower border of the soft palate and the posterior pharyngeal wall through which the nasopharynx joins the oral part of the pharynx is the oropharyngeal isthmus. The soft palate becomes a mobile floor, like a trap door, when elevated during swallowing (p. 525) to meet the posterior wall, so closing the isthmus. The calibre of the nasopharynx is not large; there is no reason for it to exceed the diameter of the nostrils. The cavity equals in volume and shape the terminal segments of the owner&rsquo;s thumb. The main features to be noted within the nasopharynx are the pharyngeal tonsil, pharyngeal recesses and the openings of the auditory tubes.</p><p>The pharyngeal recess (fossa of Rosenmuller) is a narrow vertical slit behind the opening of the auditory tube (see below), quite unlike the large bulge in the pharyngobasilar fascia visible from the outside. The recess in the fascia is almost filled by levator palati (p. 493). A catheter missing the tubal orifice and introduced into the recess may perforate the fascia and enter the internal carotid artery, which here lies against the wall of the pharynx.</p><p>The opening of the auditory tube lies above the soft palate in the lateral wall. The opening is guarded above, behind and in front by a prominent rounded ridge, the torus or tubal elevation, formed by the trumpet-shaped medial end of the tubal cartilage which underlies the mucous membrane, here containing lymphatic tissue, the tubal tonsil. At the lower margin of the opening is a very slight bulge, the levator elevation, due to the underlying levator palati muscle. The tubal elevation is in the shape of an inverted J, the long limb lying posteriorly and being continued downwards as the salpingopharyngeal fold, produced by the underlying salpingopharyngeus muscle (p. 489).</p><h3 id=oropharynx>Oropharynx
<a class=anchor href=#oropharynx>#</a></h3><p>This, the oropharynx, extends from the lower border of the soft palate to the upper border of the epiglottis. The wall of the oropharynx is formed posteriorly by all three constrictors. It closes completely behind a swallowed bolus, but is otherwise open for breathing. Anteriorly in front of the gap between the soft palate and epiglottis there is a mobile wall, the posterior part of the tongue. At the sides there are projecting ridges, the palatopharyngeal and palatoglossal arches (collectively known in the old days as the pillars of the fauces), formed by the underlying corresponding muscles (p. 494), with the palatine tonsils between them. The palatoglossal arches form the boundary between the pharynx and the mouth. The features of interest in the oropharynx are the palatine and lingual tonsils and the valleculae.</p><p><strong>Palatine Tonsil.</strong> The palatine tonsil (the pair commonly called simply the tonsils) is a large collection of lymphoid tissue which projects into the oropharynx from the tonsillar fossa, the arrow-shaped area between the palatopharyngeal fold behind and the palatoglossal fold in front. The floor of the fossa (the bed of the tonsil) is the lower part of the superior constrictor, probably overlain by some palatopharyngeus fibres. The glossopharyngeal nerve crosses the lower part of the bed, running obliquely downwards and forwards to reach the tongue by passing under the lower border of the constrictor.</p><p>The tonsil can be described as having borders, poles and surfaces. The anterior and posterior borders lie adjacent to the palatoglossal and palatopharyngeal folds respectively. The upper pole extends to the soft palate and may even infiltrate it; the lower pole reaches the dorsum of the tongue. The medial surface projects to a variable degree and is covered by pharyngeal mucosa which shows on its surface the openings of up to 20 tonsillar crypts - epithelial downgrowths. One large downgrowth near the upper pole is the intratonsillar cleft (often wrongly called supratonsillar; it is not above the tonsil but within it); it is the remains of the embryonic second pharyngeal cleft. The lateral surface, on the tonsillar bed, is covered by thickened pharyngeal submucosa that forms the tonsillar capsule, an extension of the pharyngobasilar fascia. (A peritonsillar abscess occurs outside the capsule.) The superior constrictor separates this surface from the facial artery and two of its branches, the ascending palatine and tonsillar. A small semilunar fold of mucosa separates the tonsil from the uvula and extends from the palatopharyngeal arch to the upper pole. (A second mucosal fold, from the palatoglossal arch extending over the lower part, is present in fetal life, but disappears in childhood because it becomes invaded by tonsillar tissue.) The palatine, lingual, pharyngeal and tubal tonsils collectively form an interrupted circle of lymphoid tissue (Waldeyer&rsquo;s ring) at the upper end of the respiratory and alimentary tracts.</p><p><strong>Blood supply.</strong> The tonsillar branch of the facial artery forms the main arterial supply; it enters the tonsil by arching over the upper border of styloglossus and piercing the superior constrictor. There are smaller contributions from the lingual, ascending pharyngeal and ascending palatine vessels. The internal carotid artery is about 2.5 cm (1 in) posterolateral to the tonsil and separated from the pharyngeal wall by loose fat and connective tissue. It is therefore well out of the way in tonsillectomy (although an unusually tortuous internal carotid has been known to be damaged).</p><p>The veins form a plexus round the capsule and pierce the superior constrictor to drain into the pharyngeal plexus. One particularly large vein comes into the tonsillar bed from the soft palate; this is the external palatine vein, commonly called paratonsillar, and the one usually causing venous haemorrhage after tonsillectomy.</p><p><strong>Lymph drainage.</strong> Lymphatic channels pierce the superior constrictor to reach nodes of the deep cervical group, mostly to the jugulodigastric nodes below the angle of the mandible.</p><p><strong>Nerve supply.</strong> The mucous membrane overlying the tonsil is supplied by the tonsillar branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve and the lesser palatine nerves (p. 469).</p><p><strong>Tonsillectomy.</strong> The older method of removing tonsils by guillotine has given place to a more precise approach. The tonsil is dissected away from the tonsillar bed by cutting through the mucous membrane at the margins of the arches, starting at the upper pole and working down and keeping close to the tonsillar capsule. Undue haemorrhage may arise from the paratonsillar vein; arterial haemorrhage should only be a hazard if the tonsillar bed has been penetrated - the tonsillar and ascending palatine arteries (and rarely an unusually tortuous facial artery) lie on the outer side of the superior constrictor. The internal carotid artery should be more than 2 cm away, but even this has been known to curl to the pharyngeal wall and be damaged. The glossopharyngeal nerve is at risk if the lower part of the superior constrictor is penetrated.</p><p><strong>Valleculae.</strong> The valleculae lie between the epiglottis and the posterior surface of the tongue. They are shallow pits separated by the median glossoepiglottic fold and limited inferolaterally by the lateral glossoepiglottic folds. The nerve supply of the mucosa of the valleculae, including that of the very lowest part of the tongue that forms the anterior vallecular wall (p. 481), is by the internal laryngeal nerve. A crumb that goes down the wrong way is one that lodges in the vallecula and sets up a reflex bout of coughing (p. 503) to dislodge it.</p><h3 id=laryngopharynx>Laryngopharynx
<a class=anchor href=#laryngopharynx>#</a></h3><p>This part of the pharynx, the laryngopharynx, extends from the upper border of the epiglottis to the level of the cricoid cartilage (C6 vertebra) where it becomes continuous with the oesophagus. Its main features are the opening into the larynx (aditus or laryngeal inlet) which bulges backwards into the third part of the pharynx, and the piriform recesses on either side. The posterior wall is formed by the three overlapping constrictors down to the level of the vocal folds (upper border of cricoid lamina). Below this (i.e. behind the cricoid lamina) is the dehiscence of Killian and finally the cricopharyngeal sphincter. At each side of the epiglottis the lateral glossoepiglottic fold separates the oropharynx from the laryngeal part. Below the fold is the piriform recess (piriform fossa). This is bounded medially by the quadrangular membrane of the larynx, below the aryepiglottic fold (p. 498). The lateral wall of the recess, beneath the mucous membrane, consists of thyrohyoid membrane above and the lamina of the thyroid cartilage below (Fig. 6.29). The recesses are danger sites for perforation by an endoscope.</p><p>The piriform recesses, broad above and narrow below, lie beside the aperture of the larynx. Below the aperture the arytenoids and the lamina of the cricoid cartilage are draped over with mucous membrane. This lower part of the pharynx (often called by clinicians the hypopharynx) thus possesses an anterior wall. It is flat, and the posterior wall lies against it, obliterating the piriform recesses as the hypopharynx tapers off, wedge-shaped, into the clasp of the cricopharyngeus muscle. Note that the posterior wall of the hypopharynx is, in fact, the dehiscence of Killian.</p><p>The thyrohyoid membrane is perforated by the superior laryngeal vessels and the internal laryngeal nerve. Note that when these vessels and nerve perforate the thyrohyoid membrane they are not yet in the larynx, but lie beneath the mucous membrane of the piriform recess. Similarly the inferior laryngeal vessels and recurrent laryngeal nerve, passing beneath the cricopharyngeus part of the inferior constrictor, enter first the pharynx. The superior and inferior vessels anastomose and the nerves communicate in the mucous membrane of the pharynx, which they supply (Fig. 6.29). After having given off these communicating branches the vessels and nerves enter the larynx. In the larynx they have no anastomoses; the vocal folds are a complete watershed for vessels and nerves.</p><h2 id=soft-palate>Soft Palate
<a class=anchor href=#soft-palate>#</a></h2><p>The soft palate hangs down from the back of the hard palate as a mobile fold that fuses at the sides with the lateral wall of the pharynx and which can be raised so that its lower border makes contact with the posterior wall of the pharynx to close off the nasopharynx during swallowing. It consists of an aponeurosis that is acted upon by several muscles to alter its shape and position, but much of its bulk is due to the large volume of mucous and serous glands within the mucous membrane of its oral surface. There are five paired muscles: tensor palati, levator palati, palatoglossus (which also belongs to the tongue), palatopharyngeus (which also belongs to the pharynx) and the muscle of the uvula. The tensor and levator are properly called tensor veli palatini and levator veli palatini, but the older and simpler name is retained here.</p><h3 id=tensor-palati>Tensor Palati
<a class=anchor href=#tensor-palati>#</a></h3><p>This is a thin triangular muscle. It arises outside the palate from the scaphoid fossa at the upper end of the medial pterygoid plate, the lateral side of the cartilaginous part of the auditory tube, and the spine of the sphenoid, i.e. from a bony origin at the front and back and from cartilage in between. From this origin of about 2 cm in extent the flat muscle converges towards the base of the pterygoid hamulus where it becomes a flat tendon. The tendon passes above the fibrous arch in the origin of the buccinator (Fig. 6.11), bends at a right angle around the hamulus and so gets inside the pharynx. The tendon now broadens out into a wide triangular aponeurosis. Its anterior border is attached to the crest of the palatine bone, the medial border blending with that of the opposite side. The posterolateral border blends with the side wall of the pharynx in front, but hangs free behind, forming the edge of the soft palate with the dependent uvula in the midline. In cleft palate the muscle is abnormally inserted into the back of the hard palate. The uvula is a mass of mucous glandular tissue, with some unimportant muscle fibres attached to the posterior nasal spine. Note that each tensor palati consists of two triangles converging on the base of the hamulus, the vertical one of muscle, the other of aponeurosis. The aponeurosis is not flat, but concave towards the mouth; when tensed by contraction of the muscle it is flattened and therefore depressed somewhat. The main action of the tensor palati is so to tense the palatine aponeurosis that other muscles may elevate and depress it without altering its shape. When the tensor palati contracts (e.g. in swallowing) it pulls upon the cartilage of the auditory tube, opens the tube, and permits equalization of air pressure between the middle ear and nose (Fig. 6.30).</p><h3 id=levator-palati>Levator Palati
<a class=anchor href=#levator-palati>#</a></h3><p>This is a round mass of muscle about as thick as a pencil. Arising from the quadrate area at the apex of the petrous bone anterior to the carotid canal and from the adjacent medial side of the cartilaginous part of the auditory tube, it forms a rounded belly that is inserted into the nasal surface of the palatine aponeurosis between the two heads of palatopharyngeus. The two levator muscles in passing down to the palate are directed forwards and medially, together forming a V-shaped sling (Fig. 6.32). Their contraction pulls the palate upwards and backwards. If the tensor is relaxed two dimples appear on the oral surface of the palate as the levators contract; much more usually the tensor stiffens the palatine aponeurosis and the soft palate is raised without alteration in shape. In either case the nasopharynx is shut off from the oropharynx by the action of the levators. The soft palate comes into contact with the posterior wall of the pharynx at Passavant&rsquo;s ridge (see below) on a level with the anterior arch of the atlas vertebra. Contraction of the levator also opens the cartilaginous tube and equalizes air pressure between the middle ear and the nose.</p><h3 id=palatoglossus-1>Palatoglossus
<a class=anchor href=#palatoglossus-1>#</a></h3><p>The muscle arises from the under surface of the palatine aponeurosis and passes downwards to interdigitate with styloglossus. The muscle raises the palatoglossal fold of mucous membrane in front of the tonsil (the anterior pillar of the fauces), marking the junction between mouth and pharynx, and between mucous membrane supplied by mandibular and glossopharyngeal nerves. Its action is sphincteric at the oropharyngeal isthmus; it raises the tongue and narrows the transverse diameter of the isthmus.</p><h3 id=palatopharyngeus-1>Palatopharyngeus
<a class=anchor href=#palatopharyngeus-1>#</a></h3><p>The muscle arises from two heads, the one fixed to bone, the other movable on the palatine aponeurosis. The two heads embrace the insertion of levator palati on the upper surface of the palatine aponeurosis. The anterior head arises from the posterior border of the hard palate (i.e. the horizontal plate of the palatine bone). At this level the palatine aponeurosis lies just on its oral surface, and passes further forwards to reach the crest of the palatine bone (Fig. 6.31). The posterior head arises further back on the upper surface of the aponeurosis.</p><h3 id=palatopharyngeal-sphincter>Palatopharyngeal Sphincter
<a class=anchor href=#palatopharyngeal-sphincter>#</a></h3><p>In keen-scented mammals the epiglottis rides above the level of the soft palate and the larynx is intranarial. It is supported in this elevated position by stylopharyngeus and salpingopharyngeus and held in a sphincter, the palatopharyngeus muscle, that clasps the laryngeal inlet. In man the larynx is never intranarial: at its much lower level it has pulled down the sphincter to produce the palatopharyngeus muscle as described above. However, some fibres remain to form a palatopharyngeal sphincter (Figs 6.31-6.33) at the level of the hard palate and anterior arch of the atlas (though it appears uncertain whether the fibres belong to palatopharyngeus or the superior constrictor or both). During swallowing they take part in a general forward movement of the posterior pharyngeal wall to which the elevated soft palate becomes approximated; the sphincteric fibres form a slight ridge (historically known as Passavant&rsquo;s ridge), and they become hypertrophied in cleft palate, in an effort to close an abnormally large pharyngeal isthmus. It is important to note that the ridge is not an anatomical feature that can be seen when inspecting a living or cadaveric pharynx; it only exists momentarily when the palate is raised, and (like the lower oesophageal sphincter) it is not recognizable on dissection. The illustrations of sphincter fibres in Figures 6.31-6.33 indicate their position at the moment when they are in action. It is palatal rather than pharyngeal movement that is mainly responsible for closing off the nasopharynx from the oropharynx.</p><h3 id=blood-supply-6>Blood Supply
<a class=anchor href=#blood-supply-6>#</a></h3><p>Lesser palatine branches of the maxillary artery, the ascending palatine branch of the facial artery, and palatine branches of the ascending pharyngeal artery anastomose freely in the soft palate. Most of the venous blood is drained laterally through the wall of the pharynx into the pharyngeal venous plexus and the pterygoid plexus.</p><h3 id=lymph-drainage-5>Lymph Drainage
<a class=anchor href=#lymph-drainage-5>#</a></h3><p>By lymphatics that empty into the retropharyngeal and upper deep cervical lymph nodes.</p><h3 id=nerve-supply-5>Nerve Supply
<a class=anchor href=#nerve-supply-5>#</a></h3><p>The general statement is that all the muscles of the soft palate are supplied by the pharyngeal plexus except for tensor palati, which is supplied by a branch from the nerve to the medial pterygoid (from the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve - p. 461). The plexus fibres to the palate are from the nucleus ambiguus via the cranial part of the accessory nerve and the pharyngeal branch of the vagus. Secretomotor fibres to the palatal glands run with the lesser palatine nerves and are derived from cell bodies in the pterygopalatine ganglion. They are activated from the superior salivary nucleus in the pons by way of the nervus intermedius and the greater petrosal nerve (p. 571).</p><p>The mucous membrane of the soft palate is supplied essentially from the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve, though on its oral surface there is an overlap of glossopharyngeal fibres that encroach on its lateral border from the lateral wall of the pharynx. Maxillary nerve fibres are derived from the (usually) paired lesser palatine nerves which pass through the pterygopalatine ganglion without relay, their cell bodies lying in the trigeminal ganglion. Taste fibres in the greater petrosal nerve supply the few taste buds on the oral surface of the soft palate (cell bodies in the geniculate ganglion, central processes in the nervus intermedius and so to the tractus solitarius in the pons). The greater petrosal nerve carries a few trespassing fibres of common sensation from the facial nerve; these run in the lesser palatine nerves to the intratonsillar cleft (p. 490). Their cell bodies are in the geniculate ganglion.</p><h3 id=structure-5>Structure
<a class=anchor href=#structure-5>#</a></h3><p>The soft palate is covered with wear and tear epithelium (stratified squamous) on its oral surface and on the posterior part of its nasal surface, where it comes into contact with Passavant&rsquo;s ridge. Its oral epithelium contains a few scattered taste buds. The anterior part of its nasal surface is covered with respiratory mucous membrane. The thickness of the palate and uvula is occupied by a large mass of mucous and serous glands below the palatine aponeurosis; the ducts of these glands open by orifices scattered over the oral epithelium. Scattered lymphatic follicles are found in the oral mucous membrane.</p><h3 id=function>Function
<a class=anchor href=#function>#</a></h3><p>The soft palate is a flap valve that can shut off the oropharynx from the mouth (e.g. during chewing, so that breathing is unimpeded) or from the nasopharynx (e.g. in swallowing to prevent food entering the nasopharynx, or in coughing when the whole blast escapes through the mouth, or when blowing the bugle, etc.). When elevated it locks into Passavant&rsquo;s ridge, which exists only at this moment and disappears as the soft palate comes down. The plentiful mucous glands make its oral surface slippery, like the posterior third of the tongue, for swallowing. Short of full upward or downward closure, its position is determined by the opposing pulls of levator palati and the posterior head of palatopharyngeus; thus can the resonating chambers be altered to modify the quality of the voice. In sneezing, it is held firm to resist being blown inside out and its position determines how much of the blast is directed through the nose. Too violent an explosion might damage the conchae; the excess escapes harmlessly through the mouth.</p><p>If there were no crossing of air and food pathways there would be no soft palate. The crossing is beneficial in several ways. The nose must be narrow for warming, moistening and cleaning the gentle stream of air in tranquil breathing. It is inadequate for increased pulmonary ventilation; the open mouth is needed then. Coughing would be very ineffective if sputum had to be expelled through the narrow nose instead of into the pharynx or mouth, to be expectorated or swallowed. And you cannot talk through your nose (try it with closed lips).</p><h3 id=gag-reflex>Gag Reflex
<a class=anchor href=#gag-reflex>#</a></h3><p>Elevation of the palate and contraction of pharyngeal muscles - the gag reflex - occur when the palate, tonsil, posterior part of the tongue or posterior pharyngeal wall are touched by an unfamiliar object, as when testing with a swab (but the passage of food over the same areas does not cause the reflex, due to conditioned familiarity). The afferent side of the reflex is glossopharyngeal to the nucleus of the tractus solitarius and the efferent is vagal.</p><h2 id=larynx>Larynx
<a class=anchor href=#larynx>#</a></h2><p>The larynx is a respiratory organ, set in the respiratory tract between the pharynx and trachea. It lies below the hyoid bone in the midline of the neck where the laryngeal prominence, commonly known as Adam&rsquo;s apple, is the most obvious part. It projects backwards into the laryngeal part of the pharynx where the inlet of the larynx is situated. The larynx becomes continuous with the trachea at the level of C6 vertebra.</p><p>The essential reason for the existence of a larynx is not for phonation, although this has become a major function in man, but to provide a protective sphincter at the inlet of the air passages. The larynx first appears in the lung fish as a simple muscular sphincter surrounding the opening of the air passage in the floor of the pharynx. A functional improvement is found in the addition of dilator fibres which radiate outwards from the sphincter. Next a bar of cartilage appears on each side of the larynx; to it the dilator fibres become attached. A later modification is the division of each cartilaginous bar into a cranial and a caudal half. In mammals the cranial halves appear as the arytenoid cartilages; the caudal cartilages fuse to form a ring, the cricoid. A protective shield, the thyroid cartilage, is developed anteriorly. Evidence of the essential function of the larynx is provided by birds, in whom the rima of the glottis (the space between the vocal folds) in the floor of the mouth shuts to close the air inlet, but is silent; phonation is from a dilatation, the syrinx, at the lower end of the trachea just above its bifurcation.</p><p>Keen-scented animals, in order not to interrupt respiration during swallowing, have developed an intranarial larynx. The epiglottis has evolved as a flap to protrude above the soft palate in these animals. The inlet of the larynx, protruding into the nasopharynx, is suspended there by the elevators of the larynx, and clasped by the sphincter muscle of the pharyngeal isthmus. The epiglottis is a modification for olfaction in these animals (but not in man).</p><p>In animals that possess an intranarial larynx and also have to swallow large amounts of liquid food (e.g. ruminants, toothed whales, etc.) there are developed folds of mucous membrane that form side walls rising above the glottis. A lateral gutter thus passes along each side of the epiglottis and laryngeal aperture - a food channel for deglutition during uninterrupted respiration. The aryepiglottic folds are a modification for deglutition.</p><h2 id=skeleton-of-the-larynx>Skeleton of the Larynx
<a class=anchor href=#skeleton-of-the-larynx>#</a></h2><p>The skeletal framework of the larynx consists of cartilages, joints, ligaments and membranes. There are three single cartilages (thyroid, cricoid and epiglottic) and three pairs of cartilages (arytenoid, corniculate and cuneiform) and also three pairs of joints (cricothyroid, cricoarytenoid and arytenocorniculate). The ligaments and membranes can be classified as extrinsic (thyrohyoid membrane and cricotracheal, hyoepiglottic and thyroepiglottic ligaments) and intrinsic (quadrangular membrane and cricothyroid ligament). The all-important vocal folds (vocal cords) are formed from the upper part of the cricothyroid ligament (cricovocal membrane).</p><p>The thyroid, cricoid and arytenoid cartilages are composed of hyaline cartilage; with age, parts of them may calcify or ossify. The epiglottic, corniculate and cuneiforms are of elastic fibrocartilage.</p><h3 id=thyroid-cartilage>Thyroid Cartilage
<a class=anchor href=#thyroid-cartilage>#</a></h3><p>The thyroid cartilage (Fig. 6.34) consists of two conjoined laminae whose posterior borders are free and projected upwards and downwards as the superior and inferior horns. Each inferior horn articulates with the cricoid cartilage to form the cricothyroid joint. The outer surface of each lamina possesses an oblique ridge bounded above and below by a tubercle. The site of union of the two laminae anteriorly forms the laryngeal prominence (Adam&rsquo;s apple). A deep midline notch lies above the prominence.</p><h3 id=cricoid-cartilage>Cricoid Cartilage
<a class=anchor href=#cricoid-cartilage>#</a></h3><p>The cricoid cartilage is the foundation of the larynx; to this signet-ring structure (Fig. 6.35) the thyroid and arytenoid cartilages are articulated by synovial joints. It is the only complete cartilaginous ring in the whole of the air passages. The anterior part of the ring is the arch; posteriorly it is projected upwards as a quadrangular flat part, the lamina. Near the junction of the arch and lamina is an articular facet for the inferior horn of the thyroid cartilage. Note that the upper part of the lamina has sloping shoulders, which carry articular facets for the arytenoids. A vertical ridge in the midline of the lamina produces a shallow concavity on each side for the attachment of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle; the ridge itself gives attachment to the oesophageal tendon.</p><h3 id=epiglottic-cartilage>Epiglottic Cartilage
<a class=anchor href=#epiglottic-cartilage>#</a></h3><p>The epiglottic cartilage is a slightly curled, leaf-shaped structure, prolonged below into a slender process (the stalk of the leaf) attached in the midline to the thyroid cartilage below the notch in its upper border. The epiglottic cartilage leans back from its attached stalk to overhang the vestibule of the larynx. The prominence on the posterior surface below the apex, the cushion of the epiglottis, is produced by the shape of the cartilage, enhanced by an overlying collection of mucous glands.</p><h3 id=arytenoid-cartilages>Arytenoid Cartilages
<a class=anchor href=#arytenoid-cartilages>#</a></h3><p>The arytenoid cartilages articulate with the upper border of the lamina of the cricoid, and give attachment to the vocal folds and various laryngeal muscles. Each has the shape of a gracefully curved pyramid (Fig. 6.36), with at the base a forward projection (the vocal process) attached to the vocal fold, and a lateral projection (the muscular process) for the cricoarytenoid muscles. The superior process of the arytenoid articulates with the very small and nodular corniculate cartilage to which is attached the aryepiglottic fold. A little more anteriorly the tiny cuneiform cartilage lies within the aryepiglottic fold. The inferior surface of each arytenoid articulates with a sloping shoulder on the upper border of the cricoid lamina to form the cricoarytenoid joint.</p><h3 id=joints>Joints
<a class=anchor href=#joints>#</a></h3><p>The cricothyroid joint, between the inferior horn of the thyroid cartilage and the facet on the side of the cricoid, is synovial. There is a capsule reinforced by a thickening below and behind. Movement between the cricoid and thyroid occurs round an axis that passes transversely between the two joints, so that one cartilage can rock backwards and forwards on the other. The recurrent laryngeal nerve lies immediately behind this joint.</p><p>The cricoarytenoid joint is also synovial, with a capsule reinforced by the posterior cricoarytenoid ligament. The capsule is lax, allowing both rotary and lateral gliding movements. The ratio of rotary to gliding movements varies widely in different species. Gliding of the arytenoids opens the gap between the vocal folds (the rima of the glottis) in the shape of a V; rotation opens it in the shape of a diamond. When the arytenoids are pulled laterally and downwards they slide apart from one another along the sloping shoulders of the cricoid lamina; because of the geometry of joint surfaces, which are slightly saddle-shaped, the lateral movement is accompanied by a small amount of rotation. In man there is a greater range of gliding than of rotary movement, and the open human glottis resembles a V and not a diamond (Fig. 6.36).</p><h3 id=ligaments-and-membranes>Ligaments and Membranes
<a class=anchor href=#ligaments-and-membranes>#</a></h3><p>Of the extrinsic membranes, the thyrohyoid membrane connects the whole length of the upper border of the thyroid laminae and superior horns to the body and greater horns of the hyoid bone (Fig. 6.37). The midline part is thickened as the median thyrohyoid ligament, and the posterior free borders form the lateral thyrohyoid ligaments, each of which contains the small and unimportant triticeal cartilage (like a rice grain). Note that the thyrohyoid membrane passes up behind the body of the hyoid bone to be attached to its upper border; a bursa lies between the membrane and the back of the bone. It is here that remnants of the thyroglossal duct (p. 39) may persist, necessitating resection of the central part of the bone to give adequate removal.</p><p>The thyrohyoid membrane forms the lateral wall of the piriform recess and is perforated by the internal laryngeal nerve and superior laryngeal vessels. It is not part of the larynx, but anchors the skeleton of the larynx to the hyoid bone.</p><p>The epiglottis is connected to the sides of the arytenoid cartilages by the aryepiglottic folds of mucous membrane, to the tongue by the median glossoepiglottic fold, and to the pharynx by the lateral glossoepiglottic folds. The epiglottic cartilage is attached to the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage by the hyoepiglottic and thyroepiglottic ligaments. The former consists of rather loose fibroelastic tissue connecting the anterior surface of the cartilage to the upper border of the hyoid. The latter is a much denser band attaching the stalk of the cartilage to the angle between the thyroid laminae just below the thyroid notch.</p><p>The cricotracheal ligament is the name given to the tissue that connects the lower border of the cricoid cartilage to the first cartilaginous ring of the trachea.</p><p>Of the intrinsic membranes, the quadrangular membrane (Fig. 6.37) extends between the arytenoid cartilage and the epiglottis and is a thin fibroelastic membrane. Its anterior border is attached to the side of the lower half of the epiglottis. Its posterior border, much shorter, is attached between the vocal process of the arytenoid and the corniculate cartilage. Its lower border is free, constituting the vestibular fold, formerly known as the false vocal cord. Its upper border, much longer than the false cord, constitutes the aryepiglottic fold, at the inlet of the larynx. The aryepiglottic fold contains the tiny cuneiform cartilage.</p><p>In shape the quadrangular membrane resembles the mainsail of a boat. The two aryepiglottic folds make together an oval inlet of the larynx that lies in a vertical plane, with the upper half of the epiglottis projecting free above. The shape of the larynx, from the vertical aperture between the aryepiglottic folds down to the horizontal lower border of the cricoid cartilage, can be compared with an old-fashioned ventilator on a ship&rsquo;s deck.</p><p>The other intrinsic membrane is the cricothyroid ligament. The midline part (median cricothyroid ligament) is a thickened band passing from the upper border of the cricoid to the lower border of the thyroid cartilage (and sometimes called the conus elasticus, a term that may also be confusingly applied to the whole ligament). The much more important lateral part (lateral cricothyroid ligament or triangular membrane), containing many elastic fibres, is often and better called the cricovocal membrane (Fig. 6.37A), and projects upwards from the arch of the cricoid cartilage. At the front it becomes attached (adjacent to its fellow) at the junction of the laminae of the thyroid cartilage, midway between the notch and the lower border. At the back the attachment is to the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage. Between these two attachments the upper border is free and thickened as the cricovocal ligament; covered by mucous membrane, it forms the vocal fold (vocal cord). Thus, although the cricovocal membrane of each side has a semicircular base (on the cricoid cartilage), the upper border is straight and forms part of the V-shaped gap, the glottis (see below).</p><h3 id=laryngeal-cavity>Laryngeal Cavity
<a class=anchor href=#laryngeal-cavity>#</a></h3><p>The inlet (aditus) of the larynx, through which it communicates with the pharynx, faces backwards and upwards and is bounded in front by the upper edge of the epiglottis, at the sides and back by the aryepiglottic folds, and in the posterior midline by the interarytenoid fissure (Fig. 6.38). The space below the level of the inlet down as far as the vestibular folds is the vestibule, whose lower boundary (between the vestibular folds of each side) is the rima of the vestibule. The space between the vestibular and vocal folds that indents the lateral wall forming a deep horizontal groove is the ventricle of the larynx (but sometimes called the laryngeal sinus) (Fig. 6.37A). Opening from its anterior end is a small pouch of mucous membrane, the laryngeal saccule, which extends upwards for a few millimetres between the vestibular fold and the thyroid lamina.</p><p>The all-important part of the laryngeal cavity is the rima of the glottis (or simply the glottis), the anteroposterior slit through which air passes (Fig. 6.36). The anterior 60% of the glottis (intermembranous part) is bounded on each side by the vocal fold (see above). The posterior 40% of each side (intercartilaginous part) is formed by the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage (covered of course by mucous membrane), while at the back are the bases of those cartilages. In the resting state during quiet respiration, the gap between the folds is triangular and about 8 mm wide at the back, where the vocal processes of the arytenoids are parallel to each.</p><p>Below the glottis the infraglottic part of the larynx extends down to the level of the lower border of the cricoid cartilage where it becomes continuous with the trachea. Do not confuse the rima of the vestibule with the rima of the glottis. On looking down into the larynx from above, as with a laryngoscope, the vestibular folds appear as bulges of mucosa above and lateral to the vocal folds, which are lower and closer together and move with respiration and phonation.</p><h3 id=mucous-membrane>Mucous Membrane
<a class=anchor href=#mucous-membrane>#</a></h3><p>As part of the respiratory tract, the larynx in general is lined by pseudostratified columnar ciliated epithelium. The anterior surface of the epiglottis (not in the larynx) faces the tongue. Its mucosa is covered by stratified squamous epithelium with glands, mostly mucous, which make this investing surface of the epiglottis slippery for swallowing. The stratified epithelium climbs over from the front of the epiglottis on to the aryepiglottic folds and the posterior epiglottic surface, and often passes surprisingly low down into the vestibule before being replaced by the ciliated variety; there is no constant dividing line between the two. There may also be scattered squamous islands in the ciliated part of the vestibule, but over the vocal folds the epithelium is always stratified squamous; cilia here would be rubbed off by their mutual contact. The folds are a whitish colour since blood vessels do not show through here, due to the firm attachment to the vocal ligament. There are scattered mucous glands but the saccule contains a concentration of them, whose secretion flows down to lubricate the vocal folds.</p><h2 id=intrinsic-muscles>Intrinsic Muscles
<a class=anchor href=#intrinsic-muscles>#</a></h2><p>The intrinsic muscles of the larynx are best considered in two groups: those that alter the size and shape of the inlet, and those that move the vocal folds. The muscles that form a sphincter for the inlet are the aryepiglottic and oblique arytenoid muscles, assisted by the transverse arytenoid, and if the aryepiglottic fibres are poorly developed, by the thyroepiglottic muscles. Those responsible for phonation by moving the vocal folds are the posterior and lateral cricoarytenoids, thyroarytenoids and vocalis, transverse arytenoid and the cricothyroids.</p><h3 id=muscles-of-the-inlet>Muscles of the Inlet
<a class=anchor href=#muscles-of-the-inlet>#</a></h3><p>The aryepiglottic muscle lies within the fold of that name (Figs 6.37A and 6.38), and runs from the side of the epiglottis to the muscular process and posterior surface of the arytenoid cartilage of the same side. Joining the uppermost part of the muscle are the fibres of the oblique arytenoid (Fig. 6.38), which pass from the muscular process of one arytenoid to the top of the aryepiglottic muscle of the opposite side, with some fibres becoming attached to the (opposite) corniculate cartilage. The two oblique arytenoids thus cross one another like an X superficial to the transverse arytenoid (see below). The thyroepiglottic muscle arises from the upper border of the lamina of the thyroid cartilage. Its fibres lie outside the quadrangular membrane, on which they run to be inserted into the side of the epiglottis.</p><p>The aryepiglottics and oblique ary</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"><span><a href=/docs/lasts/05.-abdomen/ class="flex align-center book-icon"><img src=/svg/backward.svg class=book-icon alt=Previous title="05.
