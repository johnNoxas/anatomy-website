## General Plan

The human lower limb is built for support and propulsion. The two hip bones (pelvic girdle, p. 53) articulate with one another in front at the pubic symphysis, and each is firmly fixed to the lateral part of the sacrum by the relatively immobile sacroiliac joint. The rigid bony pelvis thus produced transmits the body weight through the acetabulum of the hip bone to the lower limb and likewise transmits the propulsive thrust of the lower limb to the hip bone. In sitting, body weight is transmitted to the ischial tuberosities and the legs are free to rest.

The fixation of the hip bones restricts movements in the hip region compared with the shoulder, but a wide range of flexion-extension movements and a lesser degree of abduction-adduction are still possible. At the knee and ankle, flexion and extension are the essential movements (although there are some rotatory complications at the knee), while in the foot there are limited movements at small joints which are adapted for flexible rigidity coupled with propulsive requirements.

Although the lower limb is commonly called the leg, this term strictly refers to the region between knee and foot. Above the knee is the thigh, which can be divided into three compartments: anterior or extensor, medial or adductor, and posterior or flexor. (Note that the terms extensor and flexor are used here in their morphological sense; because of the way the limb rotates medially during development, the original dorsal or extensor surface becomes anterior, and the ventral or flexor surface becomes posterior.) The gluteal region or buttock lies behind the pelvis and hip, above the posterior compartment of the thigh. The leg proper also has three compartments: anterior or extensor, lateral or peroneal, and posterior or flexor (calf). The foot has a dorsum or upper surface and a sole or plantar surface.

## Part 1: Subcutaneous Tissue

The fat of the front of the thigh contains cutaneous nerves, lymphatic vessels and nodes, the termination and tributaries of the great saphenous vein and cutaneous branches of the femoral artery. The membranous layer of the superficial fascia of the anterior abdominal wall (Scarpa's fascia, p. 241) extends into the upper part of the thigh just below the inguinal ligament.

## Superficial Nerves

The cutaneous branches of the lumbar plexus that supply the thigh are derived from the first three lumbar nerves. They are the ilioinguinal, femoral branch of the genitofemoral and the medial, intermediate and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves (Fig. 3.52). In addition, the superficial branch of the obturator nerve supplies an area of skin above the medial side of the knee. All these nerves supply fascia lata as well as skin. The dermatomes of the lower limb are illustrated on page 24.

The ilioinguinal nerve is the collateral branch of the iliohypogastric, both being derived from the first lumbar nerve. It has no lateral but only a terminal cutaneous distribution. In the anterior abdominal wall it lies in the neurovascular plane between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles, pierces internal oblique and supplies its lower fibers, and passes down beneath the external oblique (Fig. 5.9, p. 302) to emerge on the front of the cord through the superficial inguinal ring. Piercing the external spermatic fascia, its chief distribution is to the skin of the root of the penis and the anterior one-third of the scrotum, but it supplies also a small area of thigh below the medial end of the inguinal ligament.

The genitofemoral nerve is derived from the first and second lumbar nerves, but fibers from only L1 pass into the femoral branch. This branch is given off from the nerve as it lies on psoas major (or minor if this is present). It runs down on the external iliac artery and passes beneath the inguinal ligament into the femoral sheath. It pierces the anterior wall of the sheath and the overlying fascia lata below the middle of the inguinal ligament (Fig. 3.1). It supplies most of the skin over the femoral triangle. The femoral branch thus described is wholly cutaneous in its distribution. The genital branch enters the spermatic cord (p. 305) and does not reach the skin.

The medial femoral cutaneous nerve is a branch of the anterior division of the femoral nerve (L2, 3). Inclining medially across the femoral vessels, it pierces the deep fascia (fascia lata) above the upper border of sartorius which, on the medial side of the thigh, is well below the inguinal ligament. It supplies the medial side of the thigh, and its terminal twigs join the patellar plexus (see below).

The intermediate femoral cutaneous nerve (L2, 3) has a common origin with the medial cutaneous nerve from the anterior division of the femoral nerve. It passes vertically downwards beneath the fascia lata, usually pierces the upper border of sartorius, and then pierces the fascia lata at a higher level than the medial cutaneous nerve to supply the front of the thigh as far down as the knee, where its terminal twigs join the patellar plexus.

The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is a branch of the lumbar plexus (L2, 3). Passing from the lateral border of psoas major across the iliac fossa, it lies at first behind the fascia iliaca; but approaching the inguinal ligament it inclines forwards and is incorporated within the substance of the iliac fascia, which is here a thick tough membrane. The nerve now passes behind or pierces the inguinal ligament, where it lies free in a fibrous tunnel a centimeter to the medial side of the anterior superior iliac spine (Fig. 3.1A).

The nerve enters the thigh deep to the fascia lata, and divides into anterior and posterior branches which pierce the fascia lata separately an inch or two below the lateral end of the inguinal ligament. The anterior branch contains all the L3 fibers of the nerve, and is distributed along the anterolateral surface of the thigh, and its terminal twigs enter the patellar plexus. The posterior branches, containing only L2 fibers, pass down the thigh along the posterolateral aspect (along the iliotibial tract).

The nerve is sometimes compressed as it passes through the inguinal ligament or where it pierces the fascia lata, causing pain in the lateral side of the thigh (meralgia paresthetica). In those individuals in whom fibers of transversus abdominis arise from the iliac fascia, freeing the nerve from its tunnel in the inguinal ligament may not be enough to cure the pain; the nerve must also be freed from the iliac fascia, to prevent irritation from the pull of the contracting fibers of transversus.

The obturator nerve (L2, 3, 4) sends a twig from its superficial division into the subsartorial plexus, whence cutaneous branches pass to skin and fascia lata over the adductor magnus tendon above the medial condyle of the femur (Fig. 3.53). Direct branches from the superficial division of the obturator nerve frequently supply the skin on the medial side of the thigh above this level (Fig. 3.52).

This is a fine network of communicating twigs in the subcutaneous tissue over and around the patella and patellar ligament. It is formed by the terminal branches of the medial and intermediate femoral cutaneous nerves, of the anterior branch of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, and of the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve (p. 185).

## Superficial Arteries

Four cutaneous branches of the femoral artery are found in the subcutaneous tissue below the inguinal ligament.

The superficial circumflex iliac artery pierces the fascia lata lateral to the saphenous opening and passes up below the inguinal ligament to the anastomosis at the anterior superior iliac spine.

The superficial epigastric artery may pierce the fascia lata or emerge through the saphenous opening. It crosses the inguinal ligament and is distributed towards the umbilicus to the skin and fat of the lower abdominal wall.

The superficial external pudendal artery emerges from the saphenous opening and passes medially, in front of the spermatic cord (round ligament) to supply skin and superficial tissue of the scrotum (labium majus).

The deep external pudendal artery emerges more medially and passes behind the spermatic cord (round ligament) to supply the skin of the scrotum (labium majus).

These are essentially tributaries of the great (long) saphenous vein, one of the most important veins in the lower limb in view of the prevalence of varicosities developing at its lower end.

The great saphenous vein, the longest vein in the body, begins as the upward continuation of the medial marginal vein of the foot (p. 189). It courses upwards in front of the medial malleolus (Fig. 3.2), crosses the lower quarter of the medial surface of the tibia obliquely and runs up behind the medial border of the tibia towards the knee, where it lies a hand's breadth behind the medial border of the patella – an important surface marking. It spirals forwards round the medial convexity of the thigh and ends by passing through the cribriform fascia covering the saphenous opening (Fig. 3.3) which lies 3.5 cm below and lateral to the pubic tubercle – an even more important surface marking. Here it joins the anteromedial side of the femoral vein. It contains up to 20 valves, more of them below knee level than above.

A number of tributaries may be expected to join the great saphenous vein in the region of the saphenous opening; like venous patterns elsewhere, the exact number is variable since some may unite with others to form common trunks or may be missing. There are usually four veins that correspond to the four cutaneous branches of the femoral artery (superficial circumflex iliac, superficial epigastric, and superficial and deep external pudendal), and in addition there may be a deep vein that pierces the fascia lata over adductor longus. The superficial external pudendal artery runs horizontally between the superficial and deep external pudendal veins; the artery is usually behind the saphenous vein but may lie in front of it. There may also be anterolateral and posteromedial femoral veins (the latter sometimes called the accessory saphenous vein) that drain wide areas of the thigh and join the great saphenous a little below the saphenous opening. The fact that the upper end of the great saphenous vein has these numerous tributaries converging upon it is an important feature distinguishing it from the femoral vein which at this level only receives the great saphenous itself (p. 155).

**Figure 3.1** Left inguinal and femoral regions. A. Muscles, vessels and nerves, with fascia and part of sartorius removed to show the femoral artery and vein, saphenous nerve and the nerve to vastus medialis in the adductor canal. B. The femoral ring and canal. The femoral canal, vein, artery and nerve emerge from beneath the inguinal ligament in that order from medial to lateral. The canal, vein and artery are within the femoral sheath, but the nerve is outside it.

**Figure 3.3** Upper end of the right great saphenous vein and its tributaries. The saphenous opening, through which the vein passes to join the femoral vein, lies 3.5 cm below and lateral to the pubic tubercle.

## Lymph Nodes and Vessels

Large lymphatic vessels accompany the great saphenous vein from the foot, leg and thigh (Fig. 3.4). Numerous large vessels also spiral around the outer side of the thigh to converge on the superficial inguinal nodes. These consist of up to 20 nodes arranged in an irregular T-shaped pattern in the subcutaneous fat of the femoral triangle. Inspection of the dissected nodes shows no obvious arrangement into groups yet they are rightly described as belonging to three groups, for they drain three distinct areas. The vertical group, lying lateral to the termination of the great saphenous vein, receives lymphatics from the deep fascia (and everything superficial to it) of the lower limb. The lateral group, lying below the lateral part of the inguinal ligament, receives lymph from the buttock, flank and back below the level of the waist. The medial group lies below the medial end of the inguinal ligament, and a node or two may encroach on the anterior abdominal wall. They receive from below the umbilicus and medial to a line drawn vertically upwards from the anterior superior iliac spine. More important, the medial group receives lymph also from the perineum; it is to be noted that the perineum includes the lower part of the anal canal, the urethra and the external genitalia of both sexes (but excluding the testes). The efferent lymphatics from all three groups converge towards the saphenous opening and pass through the cribriform fascia to enter the three or four deep inguinal nodes, lying medial to the femoral vein. Their passage through the fascia covering the saphenous opening produces a number of holes which give rise to the sieve-like appearance denoted by the name cribriform.

**Figure 3.4** Superficial lymph drainage of the right lower limb, front and back. The superficial inguinal nodes receive all the lymph from the subcutaneous tissues below the waist.

## Superficial Fascia

The membranous layer of the superficial fascia of the abdominal wall (Scarpa's fascia) extends into the thigh and becomes fixed to the fascia lata (Fig. 3.5) at the flexure skin crease of the hip joint, where attachment of skin to fascia lata limits its further descent. The attachment extends laterally from the pubic tubercle but below the inguinal ligament. It should be noted that the saphenous opening lies below this line, so that a femoral hernia, emerging from the saphenous opening, can never come to lie in the space beneath Scarpa's fascia. The hernia emerges into ordinary subcutaneous fat and can therefore never become very large.

**Figure 3.5** Sagittal section through the femoral canal. The membranous layer of superficial fascia of the abdomen is attached to the fascia lata below the inguinal ligament but above the saphenous opening, so that a femoral hernia passing through the cribriform fascia at the opening is directed into the subcutaneous fat and not into the potential space deep to the abdominal fascia.

## Fascia Lata

The deep fascia, the fascia lata, encloses the thigh, like a stocking but one whose top is too large. A vertical slit has been cut at the top of the stocking, so to speak, and the cut edges overlapped to fit the bony pelvis, so forming the margin of the saphenous opening described below. The fibers of the fascia lata lie vertically in the long axis of the thigh. Examine the hip bone or, better still, an articulated bony pelvis. Trace the attachments of the fascia lata to the pelvic girdle. The line encloses all the thigh and hamstring muscles.

Commence with the cut edge A in Figure 3.6 and attach it to the pubic tubercle. The top of the stocking of fascia lata traced laterally is seen to be attached to the inguinal ligament, which it draws into a downward convexity when the thigh is extended. From the anterior superior iliac spine the top of the stocking is attached to the external lip of the iliac crest, splitting to enclose the tensor fasciae latae muscle, as far back as the tubercle of the iliac crest. From the tubercle the single layer of fascia is attached to the iliac crest as far back as the posterior gluteal line, where it again splits to enclose gluteus maximus. The two layers that enclose the gluteus maximus are very thin indeed, but are nevertheless in continuity with the rest of the fascia lata. Attached to bone at the edges of the gluteus maximus origin on the ilium and sacrum, and to the sacrotuberous ligament, the fascia lata may now be traced along the convexity of the ischial tuberosity, the ischiopubic ramus and the body of the pubic bone, between the attachments of the adductors and gracilis on the one hand and the perineal muscles on the other. Passing over the origin of adductor longus in the angle between pubic crest and symphysis, the top of the stocking is now attached to bone just below the pubic tubercle, and, further laterally, it passes beneath the pubic tubercle and inguinal ligament, lying on the surface of pectineus to be attached to the pectineal line as far laterally as the cut edge B (Fig. 3.6). The cut edge A thus appears as a crescentic or falciform margin to the saphenous opening, which is merely the oblique space lying between the cut edges of the top of the stocking. The deep part of B lies on pectineus beneath the femoral sheath, and is prolonged downwards in front of the adductor muscles as the medial intermuscular septum. To change the simile, the edges of A and B of the slit in Figure 3.6 are overlapped like lapels of a double-breasted jacket and the great saphenous vein passes through the gap like a hand reaching into the inside pocket. The saphenous opening is covered in by a loose fascia attached laterally to the falciform edge and medially to the fascia lata where it lies over adductor longus. This fascia is pierced by the great saphenous vein.

The fascia lata is attached below to the patella and to the inferior margins of the tibial condyles and to the head of the fibula. Over the popliteal fossa it is strengthened by transverse fibers and continues below into the deep fascia of the calf. The fascia lata has been seen to enclose two muscles, the tensor fasciae latae and gluteus maximus. These two muscles converge towards each other below the greater trochanter of the femur. The deep half of the lower half of gluteus maximus (p. 162) is inserted into the gluteal crest of the femur but the remaining three-fourths are inserted with tensor fasciae latae into the iliotibial tract (see below). The triangular interval between them is filled by the continuation of the fascia lata described above, the whole constituting the deltoid of the hip joint reminiscent of the deltoid muscle covering the shoulder joint.

This arises from a 5-cm length of the external lip of the iliac crest between the anterior superior iliac spine and the tubercle of the crest. It is a thin sheet of muscle at its origin; it is triangular in shape and becomes thicker at its insertion into the iliotibial tract. Its anterior border lies edge to edge with sartorius at the anterior superior iliac spine (Fig. 3.1), below which the two muscles diverge and allow rectus femoris to emerge between them.

**Nerve supply.** By the superior gluteal nerve (L4, 5, S1), which crosses the buttock and ends in the muscle.

**Action.** Its action is to pull upon the iliotibial tract, so assisting gluteus maximus in extending the knee joint (p. 163); in quadriceps paralysis the two muscles may act as weak (and incomplete) extensors of the knee. The muscle is also very active in helping to stabilize the pelvis during walking (p. 164).

This is a thickening of the fascia lata that commences at the level of the greater trochanter, where three-quarters of gluteus maximus and the tensor fasciae latae are inserted into it. It passes vertically down the lateral aspect of the thigh, crosses the lateral condyle of the femur and is inserted into a smooth circular facet 1 cm in diameter on the anterior surface of the lateral condyle of the tibia (Fig. 3.33A). When the knee is straight, the lateral intermuscular septum is a strong layer extending into the thigh from the deep surface of the iliotibial tract. It is attached to the lateral lip of the linea aspera. From its upper end it passes backwards to the fascia lata, forming a midline septum between vastus lateralis and the origin of the hamstrings (Fig. 3.8). Its lower part lies more obliquely and is attached to the iliotibial tract. It prevents lateral movement of the tract, which forms therefore a gutter behind the bulging vastus lateralis (Fig. 3.7).

**Figure 3.7** Iliotibial tract. In A. with the quadriceps muscle relaxed, the flaccid vastus lateralis bulges over the tract. In B. contraction of the quadriceps abolishes the groove made by the tract because vastus lateralis is now in firm contraction.

When the fascia lata is removed from the front of the thigh, the underlying muscles are exposed (Fig. 3.1). The most superficial of all is sartorius, a parallel-sided ribbon of muscle that swings obliquely across the thigh. The adductor longus is prominent on the medial side, and the two muscles enclose, with the inguinal ligament, the femoral triangle.

The femoral triangle is defined as the triangle that lies between the inguinal ligament, the medial border of sartorius, and the medial border of adductor longus. The floor of the triangle is not flat, but gutter-shaped, and the hollow can be seen when the thigh is flexed. The femoral nerve and vessels lie in the gutter. The muscles lying in the floor of the femoral triangle are the iliacus, psoas, pectineus and, in the narrow interval between pectineus and adductor longus, a glimpse is had of adductor brevis with the anterior division of the obturator nerve lying on it. All these muscles pass to the posterior aspect of the femur, hence the gutter shape of the floor of the triangle. The two adductors are described on page 159.

This muscle arises from the upper centimeter of the anterior border of the ilium, immediately beneath the anterior superior iliac spine. Its parallel fibers extend for the whole length of the muscle. It spirals obliquely across the thigh (Fig. 3.1), passes downwards on the fascial roof of the adductor canal, lies near the posterior aspect of the medial condyle of the femur, whence its tendon proceeds to be inserted into the upper end of the subcutaneous surface of the tibia, in front of gracilis and semitendinosus tendons and separated from them by a bursa. It is pierced usually by two nerves, the intermediate cutaneous nerve of the thigh below its origin and the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve above its insertion. The saphenous nerve itself becomes cutaneous by piercing the fascia between sartorius and gracilis (p. 158).

**Figure 3.8** Cross-section of the left upper thigh, looking towards the hip. The vasti embrace the femur, and the lateral intermuscular septum lies between vastus lateralis and biceps, so attaching the iliotibial tract to the linea aspera of the femur. The sciatic nerve is surrounded by the hamstrings, and the femoral vessels are in the triangular adductor canal in front of adductor longus, with the profunda vessels behind adductor longus adjacent to the femur.

**Nerve supply.** By a branch from the anterior division of the femoral nerve (L2, 3, 4).

**Action.** To draw the lower limb into the sitting tailor's position (thigh flexed and laterally rotated, knee flexed). It is difficult to understand the need for this muscle in man, since much stronger thigh and knee flexors exist. Perhaps its purpose is to act as a guy rope on the pelvis (see p. 185).

Adductor longus is described with the other adductors on page 159.

This muscle arises from the hollow of the iliac fossa (p. 358). Entering the thigh beneath the lateral part of the inguinal ligament, where the femoral nerve lies on it, it curves backwards behind the femoral vessels to be inserted into the front of the psoas tendon and a small area of femoral shaft just below the lesser trochanter. The lower part of the iliac fossa is bare of muscle, the concave gap being occupied by a bursa the size of the hollow of the palm. This is called the iliac bursa, and it may communicate through a gap in the capsule with the cavity of the hip joint. It was formerly misnamed the psoas bursa.

**Nerve supply.** By the femoral nerve (L2, 3) in the iliac fossa.

**Action.** With psoas, it is a powerful flexor of the hip joint (p. 168).

This arises from the lumbar spine (p. 356). It passes into the thigh below the middle of the inguinal ligament, at which level the femoral artery lies on it. Its rounded tendon is inserted into the lesser trochanter (Figs 3.9 and 3.10). The iliac bursa extends deep to psoas and passes forwards somewhat between the two muscles, whose unequal lengths cause intermuscular gliding here. Both iliacus and psoas pass across the front of the capsule of the hip joint, with the lower part of the bursa lying between. The bursa may communicate with the hip joint through a gap in the capsule that lies between the iliofemoral and pubofemoral ligaments (Fig. 3.18).

**Action.** With iliacus it is a powerful flexor of the hip (pp. 168 and 358).

The common insertion of the two muscles and the similarities of their actions result in the combined mass being often referred to as the iliopsoas, but the term is inaccurate and has nothing to recommend it except economy of expression. Psoas is supplied segmentally by lumbar nerves. It is a body-wall muscle, part of the prevertebral rectus, that has migrated down, for functional reasons, to become attached to the femur. Iliacus is supplied by the femoral nerve (L2, 3). It is a thigh muscle that has migrated up to the iliac fossa for functional reasons. Both psoas and iliacus share a common action on the hip joint, but psoas flexes also the lumbar vertebrae, while iliacus does not. The term iliopsoas is permissible only when referring to the movements produced at the hip joint (flexion by both muscles).

**Figure 3.9** Upper end of the right femur, from the front. The rough ridge between the two trochanters is the intertrochanteric line.

**Figure 3.10** Attachments at the upper end of the right femur, from the front.

This is a quadrilateral muscle that arises from the pectineal line of the pubis and from a narrow area of bone below (Fig. 3.13). It slopes backwards down to the upper end of the femoral shaft, where it is inserted into a vertical line between the spiral line and gluteal crest, below the lesser trochanter (Fig. 3.15). The muscle is covered anteriorly by an infolding of fascia lata that passes beneath the falciform margin of the saphenous opening (B in Fig. 3.6) and is continued below as a thin sheet of areolar tissue, the medial intermuscular septum, which is attached to the linea aspera and separates the vastus medialis from the adductors. The femoral vein and femoral canal lie on the surface of the muscle, while adductor brevis and the anterior division of the obturator nerve lie behind it (Fig. 3.1). The muscle and its relations are worthy of note; it is the key to the femoral triangle.

**Nerve supply.** By the anterior division of the femoral nerve (L2, 3) by a branch that passes behind the femoral sheath. Occasionally it receives a twig from the obturator nerve (L2, 3), indicating its double origin in such cases from flexor and extensor compartments (p. 22).

## Femoral Sheath

The extraperitoneal areolar tissue of the abdominal and pelvic cavities varies very much in density. Over expansile parts it is loose and cellular (e.g. transversalis fascia on the anterior abdominal wall) while over nonexpansile parts it is often condensed into a thick tough membrane (e.g. iliac fascia). The aorta and its branches and the inferior vena cava and its tributaries lie within this fascial envelope, while the spinal nerves emerge from the intervertebral foramina behind it. Thus the vessels that emerge from the abdominal cavity into the thigh must pierce the fascial envelope, while the femoral nerve does not do so.

The femoral vessels, passing beneath the inguinal ligament, draw around themselves a funnel-shaped prolongation of the extraperitoneal fascia derived from the transversalis fascia in front and the psoas fascia behind (Fig. 3.1). This prolongation of fascia, the femoral sheath, fuses with the adventitia of the artery and vein about an inch below the inguinal ligament. The presence of the sheath allows freedom for the femoral vessels to glide in and out beneath the inguinal ligament during movements of the hip joint. The sheath does not protrude into the thigh in the fetal position of full flexion, but is drawn down below the inguinal ligament in the adult position of extension of the thigh.

The femoral nerve in the iliac fossa lies in the gutter between psoas and iliacus, behind the fascia iliaca. Lateral to the femoral sheath the transversalis fascia and fascia iliaca fuse with inguinal ligament, and the femoral nerve thus enters the thigh outside the femoral sheath. The sheath itself is separated from the medial side of the femoral vein by a space, the femoral canal (Fig. 3.1), that serves two purposes. Firstly, it is the route by which the efferent lymph vessels from the deep inguinal nodes pass to the abdomen and secondly it provides a loose dead space into which the femoral vein can expand during times of increased venous return from the lower limb. The femoral canal is widest at its abdominal end, where its opening, the femoral ring, has four boundaries. Anteriorly lies the medial part of the inguinal ligament, medially the crescentic edge of the lacunar ligament (or iliopubic tract, p. 299), posteriorly the pectineal ligament and pectineus, while laterally lies the femoral vein. A femoral hernia enters the femoral canal through this ring. The lacunar ligament may have to be incised to release a strangulated hernia, and here an accessory (abnormal) obturator artery is at risk (p. 396). The canal contains a lymph node (of Cloquet) which in the female is said to drain directly from the clitoris, and in the male from the glans penis.

The anterior wall of the femoral sheath is pierced by the femoral branch (L1) of the genitofemoral nerve, which runs on the anterior surface of the external iliac artery into the sheath (Fig. 3.1).

## Femoral Artery

The artery enters the thigh at a point midway between the anterior superior iliac spine and the pubic symphysis (midinguinal point) just medial to the deep inguinal ring, which lies above the midpoint of the inguinal ligament. Here it lies on the psoas major tendon, which separates the artery from the capsule of the hip joint, and this is the position where its pulsation can be felt or where it can be entered for arterial catheterization. It emerges from the femoral sheath and courses downwards to disappear beneath sartorius where the muscle crosses the lateral border of adductor longus and enters the adductor canal. It has four small branches below the inguinal ligament (p. 146) and just below the termination of the femoral sheath gives off a large branch, the profunda femoris, the chief artery of the thigh.

The surface marking of the femoral artery, with the hip slightly flexed and laterally rotated, is from the midpoint between the pubic symphysis and the anterior superior iliac spine, along the upper two-thirds of a line towards the adductor tubercle. To expose the artery in the adductor canal, sartorius is retracted backwards.

**Cannulation.** The femoral artery is second only to the radial (p. 93) as the site of choice for the placement of an arterial line. Its superficial position below the inguinal ligament makes it easily accessible. The commonest complications include retroperitoneal hemorrhage and perforation of the gut (by entering the abdominal cavity) and arteriovenous fistula (with the femoral or external iliac vein).

The profunda femoris artery is normally the vessel of supply for all thigh muscles (unless its circumflex branches come directly from the femoral – see below). It arises from the lateral side of the femoral artery about 4 cm (1½ in) below the inguinal ligament and then spirals deep to it, continuing down deep to adductor longus (p. 159), whose upper border separates the femoral and profunda arteries (adductor brevis separates the anterior and posterior divisions of the obturator nerve, p. 161). The profunda vein lies in front of the profunda artery, which continues down on adductor magnus very near the linea aspera and ends as the fourth perforating artery (described below with the other three). Apart from numerous muscular branches it gives off large lateral and medial circumflex femoral vessels.

The lateral circumflex femoral artery arises from the lateral side of the profunda artery or separately from the femoral artery (Fig. 3.1A), and passes laterally, keeping as near the femur as neighboring muscles will allow. It passes between the many branches of the femoral nerve, dividing them for descriptive purposes into superficial and deep groups, and disappears from the femoral triangle beneath sartorius to lie deep to rectus femoris. Here it breaks up into three branches.

The ascending branch runs up on the vastus lateralis, under cover of sartorius and tensor fasciae latae. It gives a branch to the trochanteric anastomosis and passes on towards the anterior superior iliac spine, where it ends by anastomosing with the superficial and deep circumflex iliac, an iliac branch of the iliolumbar and the superior branch of the superior gluteal artery. This ascending branch is a large vessel and in the anterior approach to the hip joint between sartorius and tensor fasciae latae, it and its venae comitantes must be secured when separating the muscles.

The transverse branch passes across the vastus lateralis and winds around the femur to form one limb of the cruciate anastomosis (p. 166).

The descending branch slopes steeply downwards, with the nerve to vastus lateralis, in a groove between the anterior edge of the vastus lateralis and the vastus intermedius. It supplies both muscles and ends by sending twigs to the anastomosis around the lower end of the femur.

The medial circumflex femoral artery arises from the medial side of the profunda (occasionally from the femoral) very near its lateral companion and immediately passes backwards between pectineus and the psoas tendon. Running above the upper border of adductor brevis, it passes between the contiguous borders of quadratus femoris and adductor magnus to enter the gluteal region. It gives branches to adjacent muscles and ends by dividing on quadratus femoris into ascending and horizontal branches which run along the upper and lower borders of the muscle. The ascending branch follows obturator externus to the trochanteric anastomosis, while the horizontal branch forms the medial limb of the cruciate anastomosis (p. 166).

The four perforating arteries pass backwards through the adductor muscles near the linea aspera, the first above and the fourth below adductor brevis, and the second and third through it. They supply the adductor muscles and the hamstrings and end in vastus lateralis. The terminal twigs make a series of anastomoses with one another, with the cruciate anastomosis above and with the popliteal artery below.

The vein enters the lower angle of the femoral triangle, where it lies posterior to the artery. In its course through the femoral triangle it ascends posteriorly and comes to lie on the medial side of the artery at the lower limit of the femoral sheath. It receives a tributary corresponding to the profunda femoris artery and just below the femoral sheath the great saphenous vein joins its anteromedial side (Fig. 3.1). Within the sheath it passes under the inguinal ligament and runs along the brim of the pelvis as the external iliac vein. It has valves just above the junctions with the profunda and great saphenous veins.

In the living body the position of the femoral vein below the inguinal ligament is found by feeling the pulsations of the femoral artery, which is immediately lateral to the vein. The vein is distinguished from the great saphenous vein by the fact that, unlike the saphenous, it has no tributaries at this level apart from the saphenous itself. In thin people the femoral vein may be surprisingly near the surface even though it is within the femoral sheath, and in varicose vein operations it is obviously vital to identify the saphenous vein correctly and not tie off the femoral by mistake.

This is the nerve of the extensor compartment of the thigh, and is formed from the posterior divisions of the anterior rami of the lumbar nerves 2, 3 and 4, the same segments as the obturator nerve, but the adductor muscles are derived from the flexor muscles of the thigh, so their nerve is derived from anterior divisions of those rami (p. 21). Lying in the iliac fossa between psoas and iliacus, the femoral nerve enters the thigh by passing deep to the inguinal ligament at the lateral edge of the femoral sheath, which separates it from the femoral artery (Fig. 3.1). After an inch or so it breaks up into a number of branches, through which passes the lateral circumflex femoral artery, separating the branches into superficial and deep.

The superficial group consists of two cutaneous and two muscular branches. The cutaneous branches are the intermediate and medial femoral cutaneous nerves. The muscular branches are given off to sartorius and pectineus. The former enters the upper part of sartorius, the latter passes medially behind the femoral sheath to enter the anterior surface of the pectineus (which is often supplied also on its deep surface by a branch from the obturator nerve).

The deep group consists of four muscular branches to the quadriceps muscle and one cutaneous branch, the saphenous nerve, to the skin of the medial side of the leg and foot.

The nerve to rectus femoris is usually double; the upper nerve gives a proprioceptive branch to the hip joint (Hilton's law).

The nerve to vastus medialis is the largest of the muscular branches, equaling in size the saphenous nerve itself. It passes down on the lateral side of the femoral artery (Fig. 3.1A) and at a point just below the apex of the femoral triangle, i.e. in the upper part of the adductor canal, it gives branches to the upper part of vastus medialis, while the rest of the nerve continues downwards to supply the lower part of the muscle and the capsule of the knee joint. Of all the muscular branches of the femoral nerve, this branch contains most proprioceptive fibers to the knee joint, a fact which accounts for its large size. The nerve is often double.

The nerve to vastus lateralis slopes steeply downwards with the descending branch of the lateral femoral circumflex artery and enters the anterior border of vastus lateralis.

The nerve to vastus intermedius passes deeply to enter the upper fleshy part of its anterior surface.

The saphenous nerve leaves the femoral triangle at its lower angle and in the subsartorial canal passes across the front of the femoral artery to reach its medial side (Fig. 3.1A). It gives twigs to the subsartorial plexus and leaves the canal by passing beneath the posterior border of sartorius.

## Quadriceps Femoris

This muscle, the largest in the body, is the main extensor of the knee joint and has four parts: rectus femoris and the three vastus muscles – lateralis, intermedius and medialis. All converge to form the quadriceps tendon which contains the patella (kneecap) and which continues down as the patellar ligament to be inserted into the tuberosity of the tibia.

Rectus femoris arises from the ilium by two heads (Figs 3.13 and 3.17). The reflected head arises from a shallow concavity above the acetabulum; it is the primary head, present in quadrupeds. The straight head arises from the upper half of the anterior inferior spine, just above the iliofemoral ligament; it is a secondary attachment of the muscle associated with the erect posture of man, and is not present in quadrupeds. The rectus femoris is a spindle-shaped muscle, bipenniform. Above the patella it flattens to form the anterior lamina of the quadriceps tendon. The posterior surface of the muscle is clad in a thick glistening aponeurosis that glides on the anterior surface of vastus intermedius. The anterior surface of the muscle is fleshy except above, where it is covered with a similar aponeurosis – here the muscle bears on a fibrofatty pad beneath the upper end of sartorius. The edges of the muscle belly itself are free but the medial border of the tendon receives an insertion of vastus medialis.

Vastus lateralis has an extensive linear origin from the upper half of the intertrochanteric line (Fig. 3.10), the lateral lip of the linea aspera and the upper two-thirds of the lateral supracondylar line of the femur. It also arises from the lateral intermuscular septum, a strong membrane that lies in the posterior midline of the upper thigh (Fig. 3.8). The muscle is largest here and tapers off as it spirals down to be received into the quadriceps tendon (Fig. 3.12). Its deep surface is clad in a glistening sheet of aponeurosis equally as strong as the fascia lata itself; the sheet glides on the underlying vastus intermedius. The anterior edge of the muscle lies free on vastus intermedius; the descending branch of the lateral circumflex artery and the nerve to vastus lateralis lie in the shallow gutter between the two.

Vastus intermedius arises from the greater trochanter and from the anterior and lateral surfaces of the upper two-thirds of the shaft of the femur – the medial surface of the femoral shaft is bare bone. The anterior surface of the muscle is covered by an aponeurosis which is continued down into the quadriceps tendon.

The small articularis genu is a flat ribbon of muscle which arises beneath vastus intermedius (sometimes fused with it) and is inserted into the upper convexity of the suprapatellar bursa (Fig. 3.28).

Vastus medialis arises from the spiral line and the medial lip of the linea aspera and from the tendon of adductor magnus below the hiatus for the femoral vessels. The muscle slopes around the medial surface of the femur. Its anterior border is free above, lying on vastus intermedius; below this it is inserted into the aponeurosis of vastus intermedius, and lower still into the tendon of rectus femoris, while the lowest fibers of all, lying nearly horizontal, are inserted directly into the medial border of the patella. These fibers are indispensable to the stability of the patella (see below).

The quadriceps tendon is trilaminar. The aponeurosis of the insertion of vastus lateralis lies sandwiched between that of vastus intermedius and rectus femoris; the three laminae are fused together by mutual interchange of fibers. A thin sheet passes across the front of the patella into the patellar ligament and the retinacula.

The patellar ligament connects the lower border of the patella with the smooth convexity on the tuberosity of the tibia (Fig. 3.60). The patellar retinacula are fibrous expansions from the quadriceps which connect the sides of the patella with the lower margins of the condyles of the tibia. They are attached also to the sides of the ligament.

**Nerve supplies.** Each muscle is supplied by its own branch from the femoral nerve (L3, 4; p. 156).

**Actions.** The muscle is the main extensor of the knee joint (p. 183) making with the buttock and calf muscles the great propulsive mass for walking, running, jumping, etc. The attachment of rectus femoris to the pelvic girdle has a stabilizing effect on the hip joint and can assist iliopsoas to flex the hip. In propulsive movements hip extension elongates the rectus femoris, which thus contracts more powerfully in the simultaneous extension of the knee.

**Test.** While lying on the back with the knee partly flexed, the patient extends the knee against resistance. Rectus femoris should be seen and felt.

## Stability of the Patella

The patella is a sesamoid bone. It is mobile from side to side. The patellar ligament is vertical, but the pull of the quadriceps is oblique, in the line of the shaft of the femur; when the muscle contracts it tends to draw the patella laterally. Three factors discourage this lateral dislocation; they are the usual bony, ligamentous and muscular factors that control the stability of any bone. The bony factor consists in the forward prominence of the lateral condyle of the femur (Fig. 3.11), the ligamentous factor is the tension of the medial patellar retinaculum, but they are in themselves incapable of preventing lateral displacement of the patella. The lowest fibers of vastus medialis, inserted into the border of the bone, hold the patella medially when the quadriceps contracts (Fig. 3.12). These fibers of vastus medialis are indispensable to the stability of the patella. They waste very rapidly after effusion into the knee joint; the patella is then carried laterally by contraction of the quadriceps, and proprioceptive impulses from the joint are interpreted as an unstable knee. However, it is not just for patellar stability that the lowest fibers of vastus medialis are important; they are vital for complete extension of the knee joint (p. 183). When these fibers are paralyzed, or wasted as after prolonged bed rest, the knee feels unsteady and the last 20° or so of extension are not possible.

**Figure 3.11** Lower end of the left femur, from below. The prominence of the lateral condyle discourages lateral displacement of the patella.

**Figure 3.12** Stabilization of the patella. The slightly oblique pull of rectus femoris is counteracted by the lowest fibers of vastus medialis.

## Adductor Canal

This canal (also known as the subsartorial or Hunter's canal) is a gutter-shaped groove between vastus medialis and the front of the adductor muscles, below the apex of the femoral triangle. The gutter is roofed in by a fascia which contains in its meshes the subsartorial plexus. The canal so formed contains the femoral artery and vein, the saphenous nerve and, in the upper part, the nerve to vastus medialis (Fig. 3.1). Sartorius lies on the fascial roof. The adductors in the floor of the canal are the adductor longus above and the adductor magnus below. The subsartorial plexus receives small branches from the intermediate cutaneous nerve of the thigh, the saphenous nerve and the anterior division of the obturator nerve. The plexus supplies the overlying fascia lata and an area of skin above the medial side of the knee. The femoral vessels leave the canal by passing into the popliteal fossa through the hiatus between the hamstring and adductor parts of the adductor magnus muscle. The vein spirals gradually around the artery. At the adductor magnus hiatus the vein is lateral (i.e. next to the femur) but ascends posteriorly until in the femoral triangle it lies medial to the artery. This is in keeping with the rotation medially of the lower limb from the fetal position, and is further reflected in the spiral manner in which the saphenous nerve passes across the femoral artery. At all levels in the thigh the artery lies between saphenous nerve and femoral vein. Below the opening in the adductor magnus, the canal is occupied by the saphenous nerve and the descending genicular artery (anastomotica magna). This branch leaves the femoral artery just above the hiatus and, passing downwards, divides into a superficial saphenous artery that accompanies the saphenous nerve and a deep muscular branch that enters the vastus medialis and joins the arterial anastomosis around the knee.

The saphenous nerve passes out of the canal by escaping from beneath the posterior border of the sartorius (in front of the gracilis) whence it passes downwards with the great saphenous vein. Just before leaving the canal the infrapatellar branch is given off; this nerve pierces sartorius and joins the patellar plexus.

The contents of this (adductor) compartment of the thigh are separated from the anterior (extensor) compartment by the medial intermuscular septum, but there is no septum dividing them from the posterior (flexor or hamstring) compartment. The muscles consist of gracilis and the three adductors, longus, brevis, and magnus, while deeply lies obturator externus. The nerve of the compartment is the obturator, and the artery is the profunda femoris, assisted proximally by the obturator artery.

The medial intermuscular septum lies deep to the femoral vessels and is a downward continuation of the fascia on the pectineus, i.e. of the fascia lata in the floor of the saphenous opening. It is quite thin. It is attached to the linea aspera, and passes over the anterior surfaces of pectineus, adductor longus and the lower part of adductor magnus in the floor of the adductor canal. Its medial edge is attached to the fascia lata. It is a thin layer, amounting to little more than the areolar tissue found on the surface of any muscle; this is in marked contrast with the dense lateral septum (Fig. 3.8).

This, the most superficial muscle of the medial side of the thigh, arises as a flat sheet from the edge of the inferior ramus of the pubis (Fig. 3.13), just beneath the fascia lata. Its origin extends inferiorly to encroach a little on the ischial ramus, but it is supplied by the obturator, the nerve of the pubis. The sheet of muscle narrows in triangular fashion and in the lower third of the thigh is replaced by a cylindrical tendon which is inserted into the subcutaneous surface of the shaft of the tibia just behind sartorius, from whose tendon it is separated by a bursa.

**Figure 3.13** Muscle attachments to the lower part of the lateral surface of the left hip bone.

This, the most superficial of the three adductors, arises from a circular area on the body of the pubis, in the angle between the pubic crest and symphysis (Fig. 3.13), by a strong round tendon, sometimes ossified (rider's bone). The muscle rapidly becomes fleshy and flattens out to be inserted by an aponeurotic flat tendon into the lower two-thirds of the linea aspera of the shaft of the femur.

This muscle arises from the body and inferior ramus of the pubic bone, deep to pectineus and adductor longus (Fig. 3.13). It widens in triangular fashion to be inserted into the upper part of the linea aspera immediately lateral to the insertion of pectineus and above that of adductor longus. The anterior division of the obturator nerve passes vertically downwards on its anterior surface (Fig. 3.1); the posterior division passes down behind it. The oblique upper border of adductor brevis thus lies between the two divisions of the obturator nerve in the same way as the upper border of adductor longus lies between the femoral and the profunda femoris vessels.

## Adductor Magnus

This is a composite muscle formed by the fusion of adductor and hamstring muscle masses (hence the absence of a septum between the adductor and hamstring compartments of the thigh), each with their own nerve supply.

The hamstring part arises from the lateral surface of the lower part of the ischial tuberosity (Fig. 3.54), and the fibers pass vertically downwards to a tendinous attachment to the adductor tubercle of the femur, with an expansion to the medial supracondylar line. In continuity with the ischial origin, the true adductor part arises from the ischiopubic ramus (Fig. 3.13), below and in front of obturator externus and as far forward as the origin of adductor brevis. Traced forwards along the bony origin, these fibers are inserted progressively higher along the medial supracondylar line (adjacent to the hamstring part), the linea aspera and up to the gluteal tuberosity (Fig. 3.23). The upper border of the muscle is horizontal, lying edge to edge with the lower border of quadratus femoris, and the medial circumflex femoral artery passes between the two muscles from front to back to reach the cruciate anastomosis. Near the top of the medial supracondylar line there is a gap in the muscle attachment through which the femoral vessels pass, changing their name to popliteal as they do so. Along the linea aspera attachment there are four small openings, the lowest for the end of the profunda femoris vessels, and the others for their perforating branches.

**Actions of adductors.** The adductor mass of muscles, though large, is less important in the prime movement of adduction than in postural and synergic activities during other movements, particularly those of the hip (discussed on p. 168). Older anatomists gave the pair of gracilis muscles the whimsical name of *custodes virginitatis*.

**Tests for adductors.** While lying on the back with the knee straight, the patient adducts the thigh against resistance, and the upper ends of gracilis and adductor longus are palpated.

## Obturator Externus

This muscle arises from the whole of the obturator membrane and from the anterior bony margin of the obturator foramen. Both membrane and muscle fall short of the obturator notch above, thereby forming a short canal for the passage of the obturator nerve and vessels (Fig. 3.13). The muscle passes laterally and posteriorly beneath the neck of the femur where it narrows into a tendon that spirals in contact with the back of the femoral neck to be inserted on the medial surface of the greater trochanter into the deep pit, the trochanteric fossa. The capsule of the hip joint extends along the neck of the femur only as far as the place where obturator externus tendon is in contact with periosteum, namely half the neck of the femur (Figs 3.14 and 3.15), whereas in front the capsule of the hip joint includes the whole of the neck of the femur (Figs 3.9 and 3.10).

**Figure 3.14** Upper end of the right femur, from behind.

**Nerve supply.** By the posterior division of the obturator nerve (L3, 4).

**Action.** With the other short muscles around the hip joint, it stabilizes and supports the proximal part of the limb. Its line of pull passes behind the hip joint; acting as a prime mover it is a lateral rotator of the femur.

## Obturator Artery and Nerve

The obturator artery, on emerging from the obturator foramen with the nerve, divides into medial and lateral branches that encircle the origin of obturator externus and anastomose with each other and with the medial circumflex artery. From the lateral branch the articular twig to the hip joint arises; it enters the acetabular notch and runs in the ligament of the head of the femur to supply a small scale of bone in the region of the pit for the attachment of the ligament (p. 168).

The obturator nerve divides in the obturator notch into anterior and posterior divisions; the anterior passes above obturator externus, the posterior passes through the upper border of the muscle, giving off a branch to supply it before doing so.

**Figure 3.15** Attachment at the upper end of the right femur, from behind.

The anterior division, after supplying the obturator externus and the hip joint, descends in the thigh behind the adductor longus, which it supplies. Passing over the anterior surface of adductor brevis (Fig. 3.1) it supplies that muscle and gracilis and ends in the subsartorial plexus, whence branches supply the skin over the medial side of the thigh. Direct branches to the skin are often given off at a level above the subsartorial plexus (Fig. 3.52).

The posterior division emerges through obturator externus (having already supplied that muscle), and passes vertically downwards on adductor magnus deep to the other adductor muscles. It supplies adductor magnus and gives off a fine terminal branch which runs with the femoral artery through the hiatus in the muscle to the popliteal fossa and supplies the capsule of the knee joint by passing in with the middle genicular artery (Hilton's law, p. 12). Note that the anterior and posterior divisions straddle the adductor brevis muscle in a manner similar to that in which the femoral and profunda femoris vessels straddle adductor longus.

## Gluteal Region

The gluteal region or buttock lies behind the pelvis, and extends from the iliac crest to the gluteal fold (fold of the buttock) which is the posterior horizontal crease line of the hip joint. Various muscles, nerves and vessels emerge from the pelvis to enter the lower limb in this region. The muscles of the region are the three gluteal – gluteus maximus, medius and minimus – and the deeply placed piriformis, obturator internus, superior and inferior gemellus, and quadratus femoris (Fig. 3.16). Bony and ligamentous features of the region include the back of the sacrum and hip bone, the upper end of the femur, and the sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments. The greater sciatic foramen is formed above and in front by the greater sciatic notch of the hip bone, behind by the sacrotuberous ligament, and below by the sacrospinous ligament. The lesser sciatic foramen is formed by the lesser sciatic notch of the hip bone, and the same two ligaments. The ligaments cross each other and so convert the two sciatic notches into foramina.

The panniculus adiposus is well developed in the gluteal region and gives to the buttock its characteristic convexity. The fold of the buttock is the transverse skin crease for the hip joint and is not caused by the lower border of the gluteus maximus, which crosses the line of the fold obliquely. The blood supply of the skin and fat is derived from perforating branches of the superior and inferior gluteal arteries, and the lymphatic drainage is into the lateral group of the superficial inguinal lymph nodes.

The cutaneous nerves of the buttock (Fig. 3.53) are derived from posterior and anterior rami. The posterior rami of the upper three lumbar nerves slope downwards over the iliac crest to supply the upper skin of the buttock. The posterior rami of all five sacral nerves are cutaneous. The upper three supply the skin of the natal cleft, the lower two, with the coccygeal nerve, supply skin over the coccyx.

The anterior rami are derived from widely separated segments. The upper part of the lateral skin is supplied by lateral cutaneous branches of the subcostal and iliohypogastric nerves (T12 and L1), the lower part by branches of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (L2). The perforating cutaneous nerve and branches of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve supply the lower central part of the buttock. The former is derived from two branches of the sacral plexus (S2 and 3) and the nerve passes backwards to pierce the sacrotuberous ligament and the lower part of gluteus maximus to reach the deep fascia and skin. Thus the segments between L2 and S2 are not represented in the skin of the buttock; their dermatomes lie peripherally, in the skin of the limb (Fig. 1.17, p. 24). The fault so produced is responsible for the posterior axial line. See page 24 for remarks on dermatomal patterns.

This is the largest and the most superficial of the gluteal muscles, and it is characterized by the large size of its fibers. A thick flat sheet of muscle, it slopes from the pelvis down across the buttock at 45° (Fig. 3.16). Its oblique lower border takes no part in forming the gluteal fold, which is the horizontal skin crease of the hip joint with bulging fat above it. It arises from the gluteal surface of the ilium behind the posterior gluteal line, from the lumbar fascia, from the lateral mass of the sacrum below the auricular surface, and from the sacrotuberous ligament. The deep half of its lower half lies behind the greater trochanter and is inserted into the gluteal tuberosity of the femur (Fig. 3.15). The remaining three-quarters of the muscle, enclosed by a splitting of the fascia lata, is inserted into the upper end of the iliotibial tract in common with the tensor fasciae latae.

There are usually three bursae beneath the muscle: one over the ischial tuberosity and the hamstring origins, one over the lateral side of the greater trochanter, and another over the upper part of vastus lateralis.

The blood supply comes from both the superior and inferior gluteal arteries, and the veins form a plexus beneath the muscle.

**Nerve supply.** By the inferior gluteal nerve (L5, S1, 2), the only muscle supplied by this nerve. It enters the deep surface on the medial side, nearer its origin than its insertion.

**Figure 3.17** Left acetabulum and adjacent structures.

**Action.** Its action on the femur is a combination of lateral rotation and extension at the hip joint, while through the iliotibial tract its contraction supports the extended knee. In paralysis of quadriceps femoris it can become an active but weak extensor. It can be felt in contraction in standing with hip and knee each slightly flexed, in which case it is a powerful antigravity muscle. In this position the muscle can be felt in ever-increasing contraction as the body bends forwards more and more at the hip. It comes into play as an extensor of the hip joint chiefly at the extremes of hip movement, as in running, climbing stairs, etc., and it is called into play little if at all in the mid-position of the hip joint, as in quiet walking, when the main extensors of the hip are the hamstrings. It is the chief antigravity muscle of the hip during the act of sitting down from standing, controlling flexion of the hip joint.

**Test.** While lying face down with the leg straight, the patient tightens the buttock and extends the hip. The examiner observes and palpates the muscle.

## Gluteus Medius

This muscle can be seen in its entirety only when the gluteus maximus is removed. It arises from the gluteal surface of the ilium between the middle and posterior gluteal lines (Fig. 3.54). Note that the middle gluteal line meets the iliac crest halfway between the tubercle and the anterior superior spine; thus with the hip bone held in the correct anatomical position it can be seen that the free anterior borders of gluteus medius and gluteus minimus lie edge to edge. The gluteus medius converges in triangular fashion towards the upper margin and lateral surface of the greater trochanter, into which it is inserted (below an underlying bursa) along an oblique line that slopes downwards and forwards from the apex of the trochanter (Fig. 3.15). Its tendon of insertion gives a strong expansion that crosses the capsule of the hip joint to blend with the upper end of the iliofemoral ligament (Fig. 3.18). A bursa separates the upper part of the lateral surface of the greater trochanter from the tendon.

## Gluteus Minimus

The muscle arises under cover of gluteus medius (Fig. 3.16) from the gluteal surface of the ilium between the middle and inferior lines, whence its fibers converge (below an underlying bursa) to a J-shaped area on the anterior surface of the greater trochanter (Fig. 3.10). Its anterior border lies edge to edge with that of gluteus medius from origin to insertion.

**Figure 3.18** Ligaments of the left hip joint, from the front. The iliac bursa may communicate with the joint between the pubofemoral and iliofemoral ligaments.

**Nerve supplies.** Gluteus medius and minimus are supplied by the superior gluteal nerve (L4, 5, S1).

**Actions.** These two muscles abduct the hip joint. This is not a very common event; the two muscles are constantly called into play, however, to prevent adduction at the hip when the weight of the body is supported on one leg. In this they are assisted by tensor fasciae latae (p. 150). Thus in walking the muscles of the two sides are alternately contracting; they also provide the pelvic rotation that accompanies walking (p. 169). They can be palpated above the upper border of gluteus maximus — feel them in walking and note their contraction when their own leg bears weight. If they are paralyzed the gait is markedly affected, the trunk swaying from side to side towards the weight-bearing limb to prevent downward tilting of the pelvis on the unsupported side.

The superior gluteal nerve (L4, 5, S1) emerges from the greater sciatic notch above the upper border of piriformis and immediately disappears beneath the posterior border of gluteus medius (Fig. 3.16). It runs forwards below the middle gluteal line in the space between gluteus medius and minimus, supplies both, and ends by sinking into the substance of tensor fasciae latae. It has no cutaneous distribution.

The superior gluteal artery emerges from the pelvis above the upper border of piriformis and, unlike the nerve, gives off a superficial branch which sinks into the deep surface of the overlying gluteus maximus, which it penetrates to supply the overlying skin. The deep branch passes laterally in the space between gluteus medius and minimus and divides into an upper and a lower branch. The upper reaches the anastomosis at the anterior superior iliac spine, the lower joins the trochanteric anastomosis.

This is an important muscle in that its relations provide the key to the understanding of the arrangement of the structures in the gluteal region (Fig. 3.16). The muscle arises from the middle three pieces of the sacrum and passes laterally behind the sacral plexus to emerge through the greater sciatic foramen, which it almost completely fills. Some additional fibers arise from the upper margin of the notch (Fig. 3.54). In the buttock its upper border lies alongside gluteus medius, its lower border alongside the superior gemellus. It converges into a rounded tendon which is inserted into the apex of the greater trochanter (that is, the posterior inturned end of its upper border). Some of its fibers run forwards along the whole length of the upper border of the greater trochanter, outlining with the tendons of gluteus medius and minimus a triangle of insertion on the greater trochanter (Fig. 3.16).

The surface marking of the lower border of piriformis is from the midpoint of a line between the posterior superior iliac spine and the tip of the coccyx to the tip of the greater trochanter.

**Nerve supply.** By the anterior rami of S1 and S2.

**Action.** To aid the other short muscles in adjusting and stabilizing the hip joint, especially in abduction.

A number of structures emerge from the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen into the gluteal region; to do so they pass above or below the piriformis muscle. Above the upper border emerge the superior gluteal nerve and vessels. Below the lower border emerge the inferior gluteal nerve and vessels, the pudendal nerve and vessels, the nerve to obturator internus, and the sciatic nerve with the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve on its surface and the nerve to quadratus femoris deep to it.

The inferior gluteal nerve (L5, S1, 2) leaves the pelvis beneath the lower border of piriformis and sinks into the deep surface of gluteus maximus (Fig. 3.16). Its course in the buttock is short. It enters the muscle towards its origin (medial end of muscle). It has no cutaneous distribution.

The inferior gluteal artery appears in the buttock between piriformis and the superior gemellus. It breaks up into muscular branches which supply piriformis, obturator internus, and gluteus maximus. It sends anastomotic branches to the trochanteric and cruciate anastomoses. One branch, the companion artery to the sciatic nerve, is of interest as being the remnant of the original axial artery of the limb in the embryo, resembling in this respect the artery to the median nerve from the anterior interosseous artery. The artery supplies the sciatic nerve and rarely may persist as a very large vessel.

The pudendal nerve (S2, 3, 4) makes but a brief appearance in the buttock (Fig. 3.16). On emerging from beneath piriformis the nerve turns forward around the sacrospinous ligament, on which it lies just medial to the spine of the ischium. It leaves the buttock by passing forward through the space between the sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments (the lesser sciatic foramen) (Fig. 5.67, p. 405).

The internal pudendal artery follows a similar course to that of the nerve, and lies on its lateral side. It crosses the tip of the ischial spine, against which it can be compressed to control arterial hemorrhage in the perineum. A companion vein lies on each side of the artery.

The nerve to obturator internus (L5, S1, 2) lies still more laterally and loops around the base of the ischial spine (Fig. 3.16) and then passes forward to sink into the muscle, deep to its fascia, in the side wall of the ischioanal fossa (Fig. 5.66, p. 404). It supplies also the superior gemellus.

The sciatic nerve (L4, 5, S1, 2, 3) emerges from below the piriformis muscle more laterally than the inferior gluteal and pudendal nerves and vessels (Fig. 3.16). It lies upon the ischium over the posterior part of the acetabulum. It is in contact with bone at a point one-third of the way up from the ischial tuberosity to the posterior superior iliac spine; this point is the surface marking for the entry of the nerve into the gluteal region. It is the nerve of the ischium or ischiadic nerve. It passes vertically down over obturator internus and quadratus femoris to the hamstring compartment of the thigh, where it disappears under cover of the biceps femoris. In the buttock it lies under cover of gluteus maximus midway between the greater trochanter and the ischial tuberosity, which is the surface marking of the nerve at the top of the thigh (Fig. 3.23).

Its tibial and common peroneal (fibular) components usually separate in the upper part of the popliteal fossa but occasionally there is a high division and the two components may leave the pelvis separately, in which case the common peroneal nerve (L4, 5, S1, 2) will be found piercing the lower part of piriformis while the tibial nerve (L4, 5, S1, 2, 3) emerges from beneath the muscle in the ordinary way.

The posterior femoral cutaneous nerve (S2, 3) emerges from beneath piriformis and in its course in the buttock it lies on the sciatic nerve under cover of gluteus maximus. Below the buttock the nerve passes vertically down the midline of the back of the thigh and leg as low as the lower parts of the gastrocnemius muscle bellies, midway between knee and ankle. It lies beneath the fascia lata, superficial to the hamstrings, which separate it from the sciatic nerve, and supplies the fascia and overlying skin by a series of perforating branches. Its other branches are: gluteal, a branch (or two) curling around the lower border of gluteus maximus to supply fascia and skin over the prominent convexity of the buttock (Fig. 3.53); and perineal, a long branch which winds medially and forward between gracilis and the fascia lata at the root of the limb to supply the posterior part of the scrotum or labium majus.

It is significant that the segments (S2, 3) of this nerve are also those of the pelvic parasympathetic nerves which supply the derivatives of the cloaca. Pain from pelvic disease is often referred over the distribution of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve, and such pain along the back of the thigh and calf must be distinguished from sciatica.

The nerve to quadratus femoris (L4, 5, S1) lies on the ischium beneath the sciatic nerve (Fig. 3.16). It passes over the back of the hip joint, to which it gives an articular branch (Hilton's law). In this situation it lies deep to obturator internus and the gemelli, which thus separate it from the overlying sciatic nerve. It runs downwards to sink into the deep (anterior) surface of quadratus femoris. It supplies also the inferior gemellus.

Obturator internus plugs the lateral part of the lesser sciatic foramen and after arising from the lateral wall of the pelvis (p. 374) makes a right-angled bend around the lesser sciatic notch of the ischium (Fig. 3.16). Its deep surface is strongly tendinous and its pressure leaves grooves on the fresh bone, which is here covered with fibrocartilage. The bursa beneath the muscle on the side wall of the pelvis extends backwards to lubricate the muscle as it plays over the lesser sciatic notch. As the muscle emerges into the buttock it is reinforced by additional muscle fibers arising from the margins of the lesser sciatic notch. These are the superior and inferior gemelli and they form, with the obturator internus, a tricipital tendon which is inserted into the medial surface of the greater trochanter where the bone rises above the neck of the femur and the trochanteric fossa (Fig. 3.15). The somewhat faceted smooth area of this insertion can be seen on inspection of the femur.

The superior gemellus arises from the spine of the ischium and is supplied by the nerve to obturator internus, while the inferior gemellus arises from the ischial tuberosity at the margin of the lesser sciatic notch and is supplied by the nerve to quadratus femoris (Fig. 3.54).

The tricipital tendon of obturator internus and the gemelli lies horizontal in the buttock, its upper border alongside piriformis, its lower border edge to edge with quadratus femoris. The sciatic nerve passes down on its surface, the nerve to quadratus femoris deep to it. Obturator internus, as it emerges from the lateral wall of the pelvis, plugs the lateral part of the lesser sciatic foramen, and the strong fascia over the muscle (parietal pelvic fascia) is attached to both ligaments and does not project into the buttock. The medial part of the foramen forms a funnel-shaped orifice which leads forwards into the pudendal canal; the internal pudendal vessels and pudendal nerve entering the foramen from the buttock are thus directed into the canal (Fig. 5.67, p. 405).

## Quadratus Femoris

This muscle, true to its name, is rectangular (Fig. 3.16). It arises from the ischial tuberosity immediately below the inferior gemellus, and passes laterally. It is inserted into the quadrate tubercle of the femur and into a line (not visible on most bones) that passes vertically downwards therefrom to a level that bisects the lesser trochanter (Fig. 3.15). It should be noted that the quadrate tubercle is a heaping up of bone at the site of fusion of the epiphysis of the greater trochanter (like the iliopubic eminence of the hip bone) and is not itself produced by the pull of the quadratus femoris. The upper and lower borders of the muscle are horizontal and parallel and they lie edge to edge with the inferior gemellus above and the free upper border of adductor magnus below.

**Nerve supply.** By its own nerve (L4, 5, S1; p. 165).

**Actions.** The actions of obturator internus and quadratus femoris like that of piriformis are primarily synergic, to act with other short muscles of the hip to adjust and stabilize the joint. Acting as prime movers they are lateral rotators of the femur, but in the sitting position they can act as abductors (p. 169).

## Trochanteric Anastomosis

This provides the main source of blood for the supply of the head of the femur. The anastomosis lies near the trochanteric fossa. It is formed by anastomosis of the descending branch of the superior gluteal artery with the ascending branches of both lateral and medial circumflex femoral arteries. The inferior gluteal artery usually joins the anastomosis. Branches from the anastomosis pass along the femoral neck beneath the retinacular fibers of the capsule (p. 167).

## Cruciate Anastomosis

At the level of the middle of the lesser trochanter the transverse branch of the medial circumflex femoral artery meets the transverse branch of the lateral circumflex femoral at the lower border of the insertion of quadratus femoris. They are joined by an ascending branch of the first perforating artery and the cross is completed above by a descending branch of the inferior gluteal artery.

## Gluteal Intramuscular Injection

The upper outer quadrant of the gluteal region is a common site for intramuscular injections, but in order to avoid damage to the sciatic nerve it is absolutely essential to recall the proper definition of this region called the buttock; it extends from the iliac crest to the gluteal fold (fold of the buttock). Only when the quadrants are estimated using the iliac crest as the upper boundary of the region can the proper injection site, the upper outer quadrant, be chosen correctly to avoid the sciatic nerve. The needle may pass through the gluteal fascia into gluteus medius or straight into gluteus maximus depending on the exact position chosen.

## Hip Joint

In general it can be said that in all joints stability and range of movement are in inverse proportion to each other; the hip joint provides a remarkable example of a high degree of both. It is a synovial joint of the ball and socket variety. Its stability is largely the result of the adaptation of the articulating surfaces of acetabulum and femoral head to each other, and its great range of mobility results from the femur having a neck that is much narrower than the equatorial diameter of the head.

The acetabulum is formed by fusion of the three components of the hip bone. Ilium, ischium, and pubis meet at a Y-shaped cartilage which forms their epiphyseal junction. This epiphysis closes after puberty (compare with the glenoid cavity of the scapula). The site of union can be seen on the hip bone by a heaping up of bone at the iliopubic eminence and at the meeting place of ilium and ischium, about a third of the way down the greater sciatic notch. These sites indicate the position of the upper limbs of the Y-shaped epiphyseal cartilage; the stem of the Y is vertical and passes through the acetabular notch to the obturator foramen. The acetabular articular surface, covered with hyaline cartilage, is a C-shaped concavity. Its peripheral edge is deepened by a rim of fibrocartilage – the acetabular labrum – which encloses the femoral head beyond its equator, thus increasing the stability of the joint. The labrum is continued across the acetabular notch as the transverse ligament, which, unlike the labrum, has no cartilage cells. The transverse ligament gives attachment to the ligament of the head of the femur (Fig. 3.17). The central non-articular part of the acetabulum is occupied by a pad of fat (the Haversian pad).

The spherical head of the femur is adapted to the concavity of the articular surface of the acetabulum. The neck of the femur is narrower than the equatorial diameter of the head and considerable movement in all directions is possible before the femoral neck impinges upon the acetabular labrum. The presence of a relatively narrow neck is the mechanical factor responsible for the wide range of movement in such a stable joint. (The shoulder joint, mechanically, is in marked contrast with the hip joint in this respect.) The head of the femur is covered with hyaline cartilage which, in many cases, encroaches a little on the anterior surface of the neck for articulation with the acetabulum when the hip is flexed (Fig. 3.9). The non-articulating convexity of the head is excavated into a pit (the fovea) for attachment of the ligament of the head of the femur (ligamentum teres), whose other end is attached to the transverse ligament.

The capsule of the joint is attached circumferentially around the labrum and transverse ligament, whence it passes laterally, like a sleeve, to be attached to the neck of the femur. In front it is attached to the intertrochanteric line, but behind it extends for only half this distance, being attached halfway along the femoral neck (Fig. 3.15). The capsule is loose but extremely strong.

From these attachments the fibers of the capsule are reflected back along the neck of the femur, intimately blended with the periosteum, to the articular margin of the femoral head. This reflected part constitutes the retinacular fibers, which bind down the nutrient arteries that pass, chiefly from the trochanteric anastomosis, along the neck of the femur to supply the major part of the head. Fracture of the femoral neck within the capsular attachment necessarily ruptures the retinacular fibers and the vessels, causing avascular necrosis of the head.

The fibrous capsule is strengthened by three ligaments which spiral around the long axis of the femoral neck. The ligaments arise one from each constituent bone of the hip bone. If the femur is flexed and laterally rotated in such a manner as to restore the fetal position the ligaments are unwound and lie parallel with the femoral neck, and are thus relaxed. The opposite movement (extension and medial rotation) draws them tight.

The iliofemoral ligament (of Bigelow) is the strongest of the three, and has the shape of an inverted V (not the Y of popular belief; Bigelow never so described it!). The base of the V arises from the lower half of the anterior inferior iliac spine and from the acetabular rim. The diverging limbs are attached to the upper and lower ends of the intertrochanteric line, each to a low tubercle visible on most bones. It is difficult to display the ligament as a separate entity, since it is fused with the capsule. The ligament limits extension at the hip joint and is of clinical interest in that it forms the fulcrum or axis around which the neck of the femur rotates in dislocation of the hip joint, as originally noted by Bigelow.

The pubofemoral ligament passes from the iliopubic eminence and obturator crest to the capsule on the inferior part of the neck of the femur (Fig. 3.18). Abduction combined with extension of the hip pulls it tight.

The ischiofemoral ligament is the weakest of the three. It arises from the posteroinferior margin of the acetabulum, and its fibers, passing laterally to the capsule, spiral upwards and are continued into a band of fibers that run in the capsule transversely around the neck of the femur. They form the zona orbicularis (Fig. 3.15). Very few fibers reach the femur, and the name ischiocapsular ligament is more accurate. The zona serves to keep the loose capsule in good contact with the underlying retinacular fibers (there is no rotator cuff as in the shoulder joint). The zona is responsible for the hourglass constriction of a normal arthrogram.

As in all synovial joints, the synovial membrane is attached to the articular margins. From its attachment around the labrum and transverse ligament it lines all the capsule and is reflected back along the neck of the femur, where it invests the retinacular fibers up to the articular margin of the head of the femur. The Haversian fat pad and the ligament of the head are likewise invested in a sleeve of synovial membrane that is attached to the articular margins of the concavity of the acetabulum and of the fovea on the femoral head.

Occasionally (10%) a perforation in the anterior part of the capsule, between the iliofemoral and pubofemoral ligaments, permits communication between the synovial cavity and the iliac bursa (Fig. 3.18). Apart from the iliac bursa, several other bursae are associated with the hip joint. There is one under gluteus medius and one under gluteus minimus at their insertions to the greater trochanter, and three under gluteus maximus (over the ischial tuberosity, greater trochanter and the upper part of vastus lateralis, p. 162).

Anteriorly the iliac bursa lies over the capsule and extends upwards into the iliac fossa beneath iliacus. The psoas major tendon separates the capsule from the femoral artery and the iliacus muscle separates it from the femoral nerve, while more medially pectineus intervenes between the capsule and the femoral vein. Superiorly there is a loose connective tissue space between the capsule and the overhanging gluteus minimus, and inferiorly obturator externus spirals backwards around the femoral neck. Posteriorly lies piriformis, and below it the tricipital obturator internus and gemelli separate the sciatic nerve from the capsule. Medially the acetabular fossa is thin and translucent; this forms part of the lateral wall of the pelvis and in the female the ovary lies adjacent, separated only by obturator internus, the obturator nerve and vessels and the peritoneum.

The capsule and synovial membrane are supplied from nearby vessels. The head and intracapsular part of the neck receive their blood from the trochanteric anastomosis (p. 166), mainly through branches of the medial circumflex femoral artery. Although the artery in the ligament of the head of the femur (from the obturator artery) is important in the young child, it is usually considered to have atrophied by the age of about 7 years (but bleeding from it at adult hip operations suggests that it may often remain patent for much longer).

The three nerves of the pelvic girdle and lower limb supply the hip joint (Hilton's law). The femoral nerve via the nerve to rectus femoris, the sciatic via the nerve to quadratus femoris, and the obturator nerve directly from its anterior division all innervate the capsule and retinacular fibers.

Examine a hip bone with its own femur. As in any ball and socket joint, movement is possible in any direction. Flexion, extension, adduction and abduction are free; a combination of all four produces circumduction. In addition, medial and lateral rotation of the femur occur. It is essential to the understanding of movements at the hip that the presence of the neck of the femur should be constantly borne in mind. For the purpose of analyzing the mechanics of hip movement it is permissible and desirable to picture the neck of the femur as lying horizontal and the shaft of the femur as lying vertical.

Any movement of the shaft of the femur is accompanied by a quite different movement of the neck and head, and in this respect the mechanics of hip and shoulder are dissimilar.

Flexion of the hip is a term used to denote flexion of the thigh; when the thigh is flexed upon the trunk the head of the femur rotates about a transverse axis that passes through both acetabula (Fig. 3.19). The muscles responsible for flexion are psoas major and iliacus, assisted by rectus femoris, tensor fasciae latae, sartorius and pectineus. Flexion is limited by the thigh touching the abdomen, or by tension of the hamstrings if the knee is extended; the normal range is about 120°.

Extension of the thigh, the reverse of the above movement, is performed by gluteus maximus at the extremes of the movement and by the hamstrings in the intermediate stage. The movement is limited by tension in the iliofemoral ligament, and amounts to about 20°.

Adduction and abduction of the thigh produce similar movements in femoral shaft and neck; the femoral head rotates in the acetabulum about an anteroposterior axis. Adduction of about 30° is produced by contraction of the pectineus, adductors longus, brevis and magnus and the gracilis. It is limited by contact with the other leg or, if the latter is abducted out of the way, by the tension of gluteus medius and minimus (as in bending sideways on one leg). Abduction is produced by contraction of gluteus medius and minimus, assisted by piriformis. It is limited by tension in the adductors and in the pubofemoral ligament, and amounts to about 60°. Contraction of the abductors is essential in normal one-legged stance (see under gluteus medius and minimus, p. 164). It is important to note that when in the sitting (as opposed to the upright anatomical) position, piriformis and the gemelli and obturator muscles act as abductors, e.g. helping to move the leading leg on getting out of a car.

**Rotation.** Because of the orientation of the neck of the femur (see above), the femoral shaft does not rotate about its own axis (unless the neck of the femur is fractured), and in this respect it differs completely from the humerus. During rotation of the thigh the femoral neck swings backwards and forwards like a gate on its hinges, and the femoral head rotates in the acetabulum about a vertical axis as does a hinge. As the femoral neck swings to and fro, rotation of the femoral shaft occurs; forward movement of the neck produces medial rotation, and backward movement produces lateral rotation (Fig. 3.19).

It is easy to understand how muscles in the gluteal region, lying behind the joint and pulling the neck backwards, can cause lateral rotation of the femur; piriformis, obturator internus and the gemelli, quadratus femoris and obturator externus can all do this, assisted by the strong gluteus maximus overlying them. Medial rotation is more of a problem. It has long been believed that psoas and iliacus, passing in front of the joint to their attachments on the back of the femur, pull the neck forwards and so produce medial rotation, but electromyography does not support this view. It is the more anterior fibers of gluteus medius and minimus that have been confirmed as medial rotators, assisted by adductors and tensor fasciae latae. Acting from a fixed femur, the glutei of one side not only prevent drooping of the pelvis to the opposite side during walking but also produce the forward movement of the opposite side of the pelvis when the leg of that side is swinging forward (thus acting as lateral rotators of the pelvis instead of medial rotators of the femur). It is possible that this pelvic movement is assisted by the oblique abdominal muscles, acting on the trunk through their thoracic attachments (p. 300), so supplementing the glutei whose muscle bulk is not very great.

If the neck of the femur is fractured, the shaft is free to rotate about its own axis, and psoas and iliacus (no doubt assisted by adductors attached to the linea aspera) produce the lateral rotation of the limb that is the characteristic feature of a fractured femoral neck.

## Stability

The snug fit of the femoral head into the acetabulum, deepened by the labrum, makes the hip a very stable joint, further reinforced by the ligaments on the outside of the capsule, especially the iliofemoral. The short muscles of the gluteal region are important muscular stabilizers. The role of gluteus medius and minimus (and tensor fasciae latae, p. 164) when weight-bearing on one leg (as in walking) is all-important; they act not as abductors but as preventers of adduction, preventing the pelvis from tilting down on the opposite side when the opposite limb is off the ground. The joint is least stable when flexed and adducted; dislocation requires considerable force and may occur, for example, in serious car accidents.

The hip joint can be approached from the front, side or back. From the front and side the routes lie in front of, through or behind tensor fasciae latae. The anterior approach is through the interval between sartorius and tensor fasciae latae, detaching the tensor, rectus femoris and the anterior parts of gluteus medius and iliacus from the hip bone so that the upper and anterior parts of the joint capsule can be reached. The anterolateral approach is between tensor fasciae latae and gluteus medius, exposing the capsule under the anterior borders of gluteus medius and minimus, detaching if necessary the reflected and straight heads of rectus femoris. The ascending branches of the lateral circumflex femoral vessels are hazards deep to the tensor and gluteus medius. The posterior approach involves splitting the middle of gluteus maximus in the line of its fibers. Piriformis, obturator internus and the gemelli are divided at their femoral attachments to display the capsule. The sciatic nerve is retracted medially and is protected by turning the cut ends of obturator internus and the gemelli backwards over the nerve.

Needle puncture of the joint can be carried out from the front or side. At the front the needle is inserted 5 cm below the anterior inferior iliac spine and directed upwards, backwards and medially. For the lateral approach the needle passes in front of the greater trochanter and parallel with the femoral neck, entering the capsule through the lower ends of gluteus medius and minimus.

## Posterior Compartment of the Thigh

The posterior or hamstring compartment of the thigh extends from the buttock to the back of the knee. It is separated from the anterior compartment by the lateral intermuscular septum, but there is no septum dividing it from the medial or adductor compartment, for the adductor magnus is a muscle consisting of fused flexor and adductor components.

The cutaneous nerve supply is by the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve (S2; p. 165), which runs vertically downwards just beneath the fascia lata to end halfway down the calf. It sends a series of perforating branches through the fascia lata to supply it and the overlying skin.

The hamstring muscles all arise from the ischial tuberosity and are inserted into the tibia or fibula; they thus span both the hip and knee joints. They are the semimembranosus, semitendinosus and biceps femoris (long head). The sciatic nerve, which supplies them from its tibial part, descends deep to them. The ischial fibers of adductor magnus which descend to the adductor tubercle but which in many mammals continue to the tibia, becoming degenerate in the human as the tibial collateral ligament, could also be considered a part of the hamstrings and, like them, are supplied by the sciatic nerve. However, the short head of biceps arises from the back of the femur and so does not span the hip joint; it is therefore not a true hamstring.

This extends from the ischial tuberosity to the medial condyle of the tibia. It arises from a smooth facet on the lateral part of the ischial tuberosity (Fig. 3.20), above the part that bears weight in sitting. It derives its name from the fact that this origin is a long flat tendon, or membrane, that extends down from the ischial tuberosity for 15 cm (6 in). The tendon is rounded on its lateral margin, sharp at its medial margin, so that it resembles a hollow-ground razor. In cross-section through the amputated thigh its appearance is very characteristic (Fig. 3.8). In wounds below the buttock the tendon provides a very useful landmark, for a finger's breadth from its lateral margin the sciatic nerve lies on the adductor magnus, deep to the long head of the biceps (Fig. 3.21). The flat tendon passes deep to semitendinosus and the long head of biceps, and muscle fibers commence to arise from its sharp medial edge some 15 cm (6 in) below the ischial tuberosity. Below this level the whole tendon is soon replaced by a bulky belly on the surface of which the cord-like tendon of semitendinosus lies. The muscle belly is replaced just behind the medial condyle of the femur by a strong cylindrical tendon which is inserted into the horizontal concavity on the back of the medial condyle of the tibia (p. 225). From this insertion three expansions diverge. One passes forwards along the medial surface of the condyle beneath the posterior free border of the tibial collateral ligament of the knee, separated from it by a bursa. A second expansion passes obliquely upwards as the oblique popliteal ligament (p. 180), while the third forms a strong fascia overlying popliteus and reaches the soleal line of the tibia.

**Figure 3.20** Left ischial tuberosity, from behind.

This arises, in common with the long head of biceps, from the medial facet on the ischial tuberosity (Fig. 3.20). The fleshy belly diminishes in size from above downwards; it lies on the flat tendon of origin of semimembranosus. The semitendinosus is well named, for halfway down the thigh its belly gives place in a rather V-shaped manner to a cord-like tendon that lies in a reciprocal gutter on the surface of the muscular belly of semimembranosus.

The tendon of semitendinosus passes behind the medial condyle of the femur and then curves forwards as it descends to the tibia, being inserted behind gracilis into the upper part of the subcutaneous surface of the tibia.

This muscle is so named because it possesses two heads of origin. The long head arises, in common with semitendinosus, from the medial facet on the ischial tuberosity (Fig. 3.20). It passes down to be joined by the short head. This has a long origin, from the whole length of the linea aspera and from the upper part of the lateral supracondylar line of the femur above the superior lateral genicular artery. The origin of the short head is by an aponeurosis which is rapidly replaced by muscle fibers that slope steeply downwards to fuse with the long head. The single tendon so formed is inserted into the head of the fibula in front of the styloid process (Fig. 3.29B) and across the tibiofibular joint to encroach a little on the condyle of the tibia. The tendon, at its insertion, is folded around the fibular collateral ligament of the knee joint (Fig. 3.30A).

**Blood supply of the hamstrings.** The hamstring compartment receives its blood supply mainly from the profunda femoris artery by way of the four perforating branches. These pierce the adductor magnus and give off large branches to the hamstrings and the overlying fat and skin, then pass laterally through the lateral intermuscular septum to end in the substance of vastus lateralis. The blood supply of the upper part of the hamstrings is derived from the inferior gluteal artery, that of the lower part from the popliteal artery. These and the perforating branches of the profunda femoris form a series of anastomoses along the back of the femur by means of their terminal arterioles. The highest is the cruciate anastomosis, in the buttock.

**Nerve supplies.** These three muscles of the flexor compartment of the thigh are supplied, with the ischial part of adductor magnus, by the tibial component of the sciatic nerve (L5, S1), the nerve of the flexor compartment. There is an exception in the case of the short head of biceps, which is supplied by the common peroneal (fibular) part of the sciatic nerve, the nerve of the extensor compartment of the leg, but the segments are the same (L5, S1). The explanation is that the short head of biceps was developed in the extensor compartment but migrated to the flexor compartment for functional reasons, retaining its nerve supply.

**Actions.** The hamstrings are essentially the flexor muscles of the knee joint, but they also have an extensor action on the hip joint, which is especially important in walking. When the knee is held extended by the contracting quadriceps the hamstrings extend the hip, particularly when the position of the hip joint is intermediate between full flexion and full extension. At the extreme ranges of hip movement, as in running, the extensor action of the hamstrings is enhanced by gluteus maximus. Note that the two semi muscles are inserted medially and the two heads of the biceps laterally into the upper part of the leg. When the knee is flexed the alternate contraction of these muscles produces rotation at the knee joint. The semi muscles are medial rotators, the biceps is a lateral rotator of the tibia on the femur. On the weight-bearing tibia the semi muscles produce lateral rotation of the flexed femur, while the two heads of the biceps rotate the femur medially.

**Test.** While lying face downwards with the limb straight, the knee is flexed against resistance, and the tendons of biceps and semitendinosus palpated above the knee on the lateral and medial sides respectively.

The sciatic nerve runs vertically through the hamstring compartment, lying deep to the long head of biceps, between it and the underlying adductor magnus (Fig. 3.23). At the apex of the popliteal fossa, a hand's breadth or more above the knee joint, it divides into its tibial and common peroneal (fibular) components. A high division is not at all uncommon and, indeed, the two parts of the nerve may leave the pelvis separately, in which case the common peroneal nerve pierces the lower margin of the piriformis.

**Figure 3.22** Right popliteal fossa. Of the major neurovascular structures the tibial nerve is the most superficial and the popliteal artery the deepest, with the popliteal vein in between. The common peroneal nerve runs down behind the biceps tendon.

The surface marking of the nerve is from the midpoint between the ischial tuberosity and greater trochanter to the apex of the popliteal fossa.

The nerve supplies the semimembranosus, semitendinosus, part of adductor magnus and the long head of the biceps from its tibial portion, the short head of biceps from its common peroneal portion. The sciatic nerve is supplied with blood by a branch from the inferior gluteal artery; this artery of the sciatic nerve represents the remnant of the original axial artery of the limb and it may persist as a large vessel.

## Popliteal Fossa

The popliteal fossa is a diamond-shaped space behind the knee (Fig. 3.22). It is limited above by the diverging semimembranosus and the semitendinosus on the medial side and the tendon of biceps on the lateral side.

In the living, the back of the flexed knee is hollow between the ridges made by the tensed hamstring tendons. In the extended knee the hamstring tendons lie against the femoral condyles and the fat of the popliteal space bulges the roof of the fossa.

The lower part of the diamond is occupied by the heads of the gastrocnemius and is opened up only when they are artificially separated. The roof of the fossa is formed by the fascia lata, which is here strongly reinforced by transverse fibers. It is pierced by the small saphenous vein and the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve. The floor is provided, from above downwards, by the popliteal surface of the femur (the area between the medial and lateral supracondylar lines), the capsule of the knee joint and the popliteus muscle covered by its fascia. The popliteal artery and vein and the tibial and common peroneal nerves pass through the fossa. A small group of popliteal lymph nodes lie alongside the popliteal vein.

When examining a dissected popliteal fossa (Fig. 3.22) the surest way to distinguish right from left is to observe the common peroneal nerve emerging superficially across its lower lateral boundary. But do not mistake the tendon of semitendinosus on the medial side for the common peroneal nerve on the lateral side!

The common peroneal nerve (also known, like other peroneal nerves and vessels, as the common fibular nerve) slopes downwards medial to the biceps tendon (where it is easily palpable in the living) and disappears into the substance of peroneus longus to lie on the neck of the fibula, against which it can be rolled in the living (confirm this on yourself). It lies successively upon plantaris, the lateral head of gastrocnemius, the capsule of the knee joint (with the popliteus tendon within) and the fibular origin of soleus. In its course it gives off the following branches: (1) the peroneal (fibular) communicating nerve which pierces the roof of the fossa and runs downwards in the subcutaneous fat to join the sural nerve below the bellies of gastrocnemius; (2) the lateral cutaneous nerve of the calf, which pierces the roof of the fossa over the lateral head of gastrocnemius and supplies skin over the upper part of the peroneal and extensor compartments of the leg; (3) superior and inferior genicular nerves which travel with the arteries of the same name and supply the capsule of the knee joint on its lateral aspect and, finally; (4) the recurrent genicular nerve which arises in the substance of peroneus longus, perforates tibialis anterior (supplying its upper lateral fibers) and supplies the capsule of the superior tibiofibular joint and the knee joint. The common peroneal nerve ends by dividing, in the substance of peroneus longus, into the deep and superficial peroneal nerves.

The tibial nerve runs vertically down along the middle of the fossa and disappears by passing deeply between the heads of gastrocnemius (Figs 3.21 and 3.22). If the latter are separated the nerve is seen passing, with the popliteal vessels, beneath the fibrous arch in the origin of soleus (compare with the median nerve in the cubital fossa passing beneath the fibrous arch in flexor digitorum superficialis). Below this fibrous arch it enters the calf. The nerve gives motor branches to all the muscles that arise in the popliteal fossa, namely, to plantaris, both heads of the gastrocnemius, soleus, and popliteus. The last branch hooks around the lower border of popliteus to enter its deep (tibial) surface.

The tibial nerve here has only one cutaneous branch, the sural nerve. It runs vertically down in the narrow chink between the two heads of gastrocnemius and pierces the deep fascia halfway down the calf, where it replaces the posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh. Passing down in the subcutaneous fat it joins the peroneal communicating nerve below the bellies of gastrocnemius where it is always close to the small saphenous vein which is the guide to the nerve (it can be used for grafts); the nerve is usually lateral to the vein.

Articular branches, the genicular nerves, are three in number. They accompany the superior and inferior medial genicular arteries to supply the medial ligament and medial part of the capsule of the knee joint, and the middle genicular artery to pierce the oblique popliteal ligament and supply the cruciate ligaments.

Throughout the whole of its course the popliteal artery is the deepest of the large neurovascular structures in the fossa (Figs 3.23 and 3.24). It extends from the hiatus in adductor magnus (a hand's breadth above the knee) to the fibrous arch in soleus (a hand's breadth below the knee) and is about 20 cm (8 in) long. It enters the fossa on the medial side of the femur; there it lies not only deep but medial to the sciatic nerve and its vertical continuation the tibial nerve (Fig. 3.23). As it passes downwards it is convex laterally, coming to lie lateral to the tibial nerve. Below the fibrous arch in soleus, as the posterior tibial artery, it returns to the medial side of the nerve (Fig. 3.23). At all levels the popliteal vein lies between the artery and the nerve. The artery lies at first on the popliteal surface of the femur, separated from it by a little cellular fat, then on the popliteal ligament of the knee joint to which it is firmly fixed by some overlying fibrous tissue and by the short middle genicular artery and, below this, it lies free on the fascia over the popliteus muscle. It passes under the fibrous arch in soleus and immediately divides into anterior and posterior tibial arteries. In the fetus the vessel passes between the popliteus muscle and the tibia and this condition may persist in the adult (Fig. 3.24).

Being so deeply placed, detection of popliteal pulsation is not easy but is best felt with the knee partially flexed, using both hands with the thumbs on the patella and the fingertips pressing into the center of the fossa.

Muscular branches are given to the muscles in the popliteal fossa; those to the two heads of gastrocnemius, the sural arteries, may arise from a common trunk. They are important because they are end-arteries and, if severed, there will be ischemic necrosis of the heads supplied. The genicular arteries are five in number, upper and lower, lateral and medial and a middle (Figs 3.24 and 3.25). The medial and lateral upper genicular arteries encircle the lower end of the femur, the medial and lateral lower arteries encircle the tibia, while the middle genicular artery pierces the posterior ligament of the knee joint to supply the cruciate ligaments. The genicular branch of the posterior division of the obturator nerve (p. 161), having traveled with the popliteal artery, enters the capsule alongside the middle genicular artery.

**Figure 3.25** Right knee from the medial side, showing the medial genicular arteries and the tibial collateral ligament. Part of the ligament has been incised and reflected to show the deep part.

The upper medial genicular artery passes obliquely upwards across the medial head of gastrocnemius and crosses the medial supracondylar line deep to the tendon of adductor magnus superior to the upper attachment of the medial ligament of the knee.

The upper lateral genicular artery crosses the lateral head of gastrocnemius and passes upwards to cross the lateral supracondylar line just beneath a small tubercle that marks the lower limit of attachment of the short head of biceps femoris and the lateral intermuscular septum, and superior to the upper attachment of the lateral ligament of the knee. The two upper genicular arteries anastomose over the front of the femur and patella with the descending branch of the lateral femoral circumflex artery and the deep branch of the descending genicular (anastomotica magna) artery, and, over the front of the tibia, with the two lower genicular arteries.

The lower medial genicular artery courses obliquely downwards under the medial head of gastrocnemius and passes forwards, beneath the medial ligament of the knee. The lower lateral genicular artery runs horizontally outwards under the lateral head of gastrocnemius, crosses the popliteus tendon and passes deep to the lateral ligament of the knee. Thence it passes forwards lying upon the lateral meniscus of the knee joint (Fig. 3.24).

**Surgical approach.** Various surgical approaches to the popliteal artery are possible: from behind, carefully avoiding the major nerves and the popliteal vein; from the lateral side, through the fascia lata and displacing biceps backwards behind the intermuscular septum; and from the medial side, either behind the tendon of adductor magnus after displacing sartorius backwards, or lower down between (medially) semimembranosus and semitendinosus and (laterally) the medial head of gastrocnemius, which is detached from its femoral origin.

The popliteal vein lies, at all levels, between the artery and the tibial nerve (Fig. 3.22). It is formed by union of the two venae comitantes of the anterior and of the posterior tibial arteries, and it receives tributaries that accompany the branches of the popliteal artery. In addition, it receives the small saphenous vein (p. 192) which pierces the roof of the fossa.

The popliteal lymph nodes consist of a few scattered nodes lying about the termination of the small saphenous vein, beneath the deep fascia. They receive from a small area of skin just above the heel by a few superficial afferents which run with the small saphenous vein and pierce the roof of the fossa, and from the deep structures of the calf by deep afferents that accompany the posterior tibial vessels. They send their efferents alongside the popliteal and femoral vessels to the deep inguinal nodes.

## Popliteus

The fleshy fibers of this muscle (Fig. 3.26) arise from the popliteal surface of the tibia above the soleal line and below the tibial condyles. The muscle slopes upwards and laterally towards the cord-like tendon, which is attached to a pit just below the epicondyle on the lateral surface of the lateral condyle of the femur. The tendon lies within the capsule of the knee joint, entering it beneath a falciform free edge, the arcuate popliteal ligament, to which the superficial fibers of the muscle are attached (Fig. 3.26). Only half of the popliteus muscle continues into this tendon; the upper half of the muscle ends in a short flat tendon which is inserted into the posterior convexity of the lateral meniscus (Fig. 3.29). The popliteus bursa lies deep to the tendon, where the tibia is grooved.

**Nerve supply.** By a branch of the tibial nerve which winds around its lower border and sinks into its deep (anterior) surface. This nerve also supplies the superior tibiofibular joint and, by a long slender branch, the interosseous membrane of the leg.

**Action.** The action of popliteus is to rotate the knee and simultaneously to draw the lateral meniscus posteriorly. In the fully extended knee the femur has rotated medially on the tibia to lock the joint. The femur, from the extended position, is rotated laterally by popliteus to unlock the joint. Further lateral rotation of the femur involves excursion of its lateral condyle backwards across the tibial plateau. The lateral meniscus is pulled backwards in advance of the femoral condyle by contraction of the popliteus. The posterior margin of the lateral condyle of the tibia is rounded off, so that the posterior convexity of the lateral meniscus can be pulled down over it out of harm's way. The mobile lateral meniscus, its position thus controlled by the popliteus, is therefore relatively immune to impaction between femur and tibia. The medial meniscus lacks such muscular control and is more liable to rupture by being caught between the two bones.

To summarize, the popliteus is a lateral rotator of the femur on the fixed tibia and simultaneously a retractor of the lateral meniscus. Its femoral tendon is attached at the axis of the hinge joint of the knee; consequently it is not even a weak flexor of the knee joint (p. 183).

## Knee Joint

The knee joint is a synovial joint between femur and tibia, with the patella also articulating with the femur at the front. Although the joint can flex and extend like a hinge, the geometry of the surfaces is complex and to liken the hinge to that of a box or door is a gross oversimplification. Extension is for propulsion, and flexion is used prior to this and also to absorb the shock (by quadriceps) in landing. In addition, the flexed knee can rotate, as in change of direction at speed. This active rotation is a matter of choice, and is not to be confused with the passive and inevitable rotation that occurs in straightening the knee in the screw-home mechanism (p. 183). During all these movements the knee is adapted to be weight-bearing and stable in any position.

The tibial plateau is formed by the upper surfaces of the two tibial condyles (Fig. 3.58). The medial condyle is oval, the lateral more nearly circular. The medial articular surface does not extend beyond the margin of the condyle, but the lateral facet becomes slightly convex at the back where it curves back over the posterior margin of the tibial condyle (Fig. 3.60). This bevelled margin allows withdrawal of the lateral meniscus by popliteus (p. 176). The femur has two condyles, separated posteriorly by a deep notch, but fusing anteriorly into a trochlear groove for articulation with the patella. The lateral ridge of the trochlear groove is very prominent (Fig. 3.11). The curve of the femoral condyles is cam-shaped (in lateral profile); it is flatter on the end of the femur and more highly curved at the free posterior margin of each condyle (Fig. 3.33). The distal surface of the medial condyle is narrower, longer and more curved than the lateral condyle (Fig. 3.11); this is for the screw-home movement (p. 176). The articular surface of the patella is divided by a vertical ridge into a large lateral and a small medial surface; this latter is further divided by a vertical ridge into two smaller areas. The large lateral surface glides around in contact with the lateral condyle of the femur in all ranges of flexion. In extension the area next to it lies on the trochlea, and the most medial of the three surfaces is not in articulation with the femur (Fig. 3.27). In flexion this surface glides into articulation with the medial condyle, and the middle of the three surfaces lies free in the intercondylar notch of the femur. This can be readily demonstrated on the dry bones.

**Figure 3.27** Left femur and patella, as seen when looking upwards from the tibia with the knee in extension and flexion. The medial facet of the patella (arrow) is free in extension but in flexion it articulates with the medial condyle of the femur.

On the femur the capsule adheres below the epiphyseal line down to the articular margin (Fig. 1.8, p. 11) except in two places. At the back it is attached to the intercondylar ridge at the lower limit of the popliteal surface, and on the lateral condyle it encloses the pit and groove for the popliteus tendon (Fig. 3.33).

On the tibia the capsule is attached around the margins of the plateau except in two places. Posteriorly it is attached to the ridge between the condyles at the lower end of the groove for the posterior cruciate ligament (Fig. 3.30B). Laterally the capsule is not attached to the tibia but is prolonged down over the popliteus tendon to the styloid process on the head of the fibula as the arcuate popliteal ligament (see below).

The thickness of the adult capsule varies. From the lower margin of the patella to the anterior margin of the plateau of the tibia it is thin. It is invaginated together with the synovial membrane by a pad of fat whose herniation into the joint raises up a median infrapatellar fold. The original capsule above the patella, between it and femur, perforates when the infant walks and so communicates with a large suprapatellar bursa which lies deep to the quadriceps tendon, extending in the adult a hand's breadth above the joint. Thus the capsule has two main gaps in it, the one allowing popliteus tendon to enter, the other communicating with the suprapatellar bursa. Anteriorly the capsule is interrupted by a circular gap whose margins are attached to the patella.

**Figure 3.28** Left knee joint from the medial side, showing the position of bursae (here distended for clarity). The superficial part of the medial ligament has been incised and reflected to show the deep part.

On the medial side part of the capsule is thickened to form the deep part of the medial ligament (formerly known as the short internal lateral ligament; see below); it is firmly attached to the medial meniscus (Figs 3.28, 3.29B and 3.30B). On the lateral side a much less marked thickening (formerly known as the short external lateral ligament) may occur under the lateral ligament, but such a thickening here is frequently absent and it has no official name. Elsewhere around the convexity of both menisci the capsule, attached to the femur above and tibia below, is thin and lax and sometimes known here as the coronary ligament (another unofficial name).

The extracapsular ligaments include the patellar retinacula and the patellar, tibial collateral and fibular collateral, and the oblique popliteal ligaments. The intra-articular ligaments include the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments and the medial and lateral menisci, with which are associated the transverse and meniscofemoral ligaments. Most of the tendon of popliteus is also intra-articular, though not a joint ligament in the strict sense. This tendon and the cruciate ligaments, although intra-articular (intracapsular) are extrasynovial.

The patellar retinacula extend from the patella to the lower margins of the condyles of the tibia; they are fibrous expansions from the quadriceps tendon and from the lower margins of vastus medialis and lateralis. In front of the collateral ligaments they blend with the capsule; further anteriorly they are attached to the margins of the patellar ligament, below the patellar attachment of the capsule. They are, of course, not attached to the femur and must not be confused with the capsule. Deep to them lie the (extracapsular) fat pad and the deep infrapatellar bursa (Fig. 3.28). Below the patella the capsule is replaced by the very strong and dense patellar ligament which, by its attachment to the tibial tuberosity (Fig. 3.28), keeps the patella at a constant distance from the tibia.

The tibial collateral ligament, commonly and more simply called the medial ligament, consists of superficial and deep parts. The superficial part (Figs 3.25 and 3.28) is attached to the epicondyle of the femur below the adductor tubercle and to the subcutaneous surface of the tibia a hand's breadth below the knee. It is a broad, flat band of great strength, about 12 cm long. Its anterior margin lies free except at its attached extremities and is not attached to the medial meniscus, being separated from it and the condyle of the tibia by a bursa. Its posterior margins converge to be inserted into the medial meniscus; only these marginal fibers of the superficial part are attached to the meniscus (Fig. 3.30B). Over the condyle of the tibia the ligament is separated from bone by the forward extension from the semimembranosus tendon and the intervening bursa (Fig. 3.28). Below this, over the upper surface of the shaft of the tibia, the ligament is separated from bone by the passage of the inferior medial genicular vessels and nerve (Fig. 3.25). Hence the extension of the medial ligament so far below the knee joint to find a firm attachment; the condyle of the tibia is free to rotate beneath the upper part of the ligament. From its tibial attachment the ligament slopes back a little as it passes up to be inserted behind the axis of flexion of the femoral condyle (Fig. 3.28). It is thus drawn taut by (and limits) extension of the knee and its terminal screw-home rotation.

The deep part of the medial ligament is the thickening of the capsule referred to above by its old name of short internal lateral ligament; it still has no modern official name despite its importance. It is under cover of the superficial part and is attached above and below to the femur and tibia just beyond the articular margins and centrally to the periphery of the medial meniscus (Figs 3.28, 3.29A and 3.30B). At the front and back it is continuous with the rest of the capsule and so only has free anterior and posterior margins when artificially cut off from the capsule (as in Fig. 3.28). The lower meniscotibial part is usually less pronounced than the upper meniscofemoral part. The whole ligament is said to be the phylogenetically degenerate part of adductor magnus.

The fibular collateral ligament, commonly and more simply called the lateral ligament, is attached to the lateral epicondyle of the femur and slopes down and back to the head of the fibula. It lies free from the capsule and lateral meniscus (Fig. 3.30), being separated from the meniscus by the tendon of popliteus inside the joint and the inferior lateral genicular vessels outside the joint. It is round and cord-like, about 5 cm long, and so quite different in size and shape from the medial ligament. It is attached just behind the axis of flexion of the femoral condyle and is drawn taut by (and limits) extension and the terminal screw-home movement of the knee. The whole ligament is said to be the phylogenetically degenerate part of peroneus longus.

The oblique popliteal ligament is a thick rounded band of great strength, perforated by the middle genicular vessels. It is a lateral expansion from the insertion of semimembranosus which slopes up to the popliteal surface of the femur (Fig. 3.26). It blends with the capsule above the lateral condyle of the femur, and in the intercondylar notch rather above its margin, so that a prolongation upwards of synovial membrane extends a little on the popliteal surface of the femur. Loose bodies may lodge here, behind the upper ends of the cruciate ligaments, and elude discovery at operation. The obliquity of this ligament limits rotation-extension in the screw-home or locked position.

**Figure 3.30** Ligaments of the left knee joint, with the knee partially flexed. A. from the front, B. from behind.

The arcuate popliteal ligament (Fig. 3.26) arches over the popliteus tendon as it emerges from the capsule, with some popliteus muscle fibers being attached to it. From its attachment to the styloid process of the head of the fibula it can be traced upwards to blend with the capsule, sometimes as far as the lateral condyle of the femur; other fibers join the part of popliteus that is attached to the lateral meniscus.

The posterior cruciate ligament prevents the femur from sliding forwards off the tibial plateau (Fig. 3.31). In the weight-bearing flexed knee it is the only stabilizing factor for the femur and its attached quadriceps (popliteus is too weak to be of significant help). In walking downhill or downstairs the upper knee is flexed and weight-bearing while the lower knee is straight as its foot reaches down to find support. Thus with a ruptured posterior cruciate ligament the patient leads with the damaged leg at each downward step, keeping the weight-bearing knee extended.

**Figure 3.31** Weight-bearing on the flexed knee. The body weight is suspended on the posterior cruciate ligament. This is the position of the upper knee during progression downhill.

The anterior cruciate ligament prevents backward displacement of the femur on the tibial plateau, but this is unlikely to happen. The anterior cruciate ligament has a much more important role, that of limiting extension of the lateral condyle of the femur and of then causing medial rotation of the femur in the screw-home position of full extension. This is discussed on page 183.

The menisci, formerly called semilunar cartilages, are composed of fibrocartilage (like the glenoid and acetabular labra). They are basically C-shaped, triangular in cross-section and avascular except at their attachments. The medial meniscus (Fig. 3.29A) is the larger and is really more comma-shaped than C-shaped, with an open curve whose ends or horns enclose the horns of the lateral meniscus. The anterior horn of the medial meniscus (the narrow end of the comma) is attached to the intercondylar area of the tibia in front of the anterior cruciate ligament, while its broader posterior horn is similarly attached in front of the posterior cruciate. Its attachment to the medial ligament has been mentioned above.

The lateral meniscus (Fig. 3.29A) is more truly C-shaped and its horns are fairly close to one another, attached to the intercondylar area of the tibia immediately in front of and behind the intercondylar spine. There is no fusion with the lateral ligament (Figs 3.29B and 3.30). Its posterior convexity is slung by fibrous tissue ligaments to the femur. These slings are attached to the medial condyle of the femur in front of and behind the attachment of the posterior cruciate ligament, forming the anterior and posterior meniscofemoral ligaments (of Humphry and Wrisberg) (Figs 3.29 and 3.30). In almost all mammals these ligaments form the sole posterior attachments of the lateral meniscus; the attachment of the posterior horn to the tibia in man is associated with upright posture. The circumference of the meniscus is attached by very lax capsule (the coronary ligaments) to the articular margins of femur and tibia except beneath the tendon of popliteus. Here there is a gap in the coronary ligament; through it the popliteus tendon and bursa pass. The posterior convexity of the lateral meniscus receives the insertion of a flat tendon derived from the upper half of the popliteus muscle (Fig. 3.29B).

The transverse ligament is a variable band that, when present, passes across between the anterior horns of the medial and lateral menisci. The delicate capsule is attached to it.

The menisci receive their nutrition from the surrounding synovial fluid; their only blood vessels are at the extreme periphery, coming in from the capsule.

The functions of the menisci are discussed below. The femoral tendon of popliteus lies between the capsule and the synovial membrane. The tendon does not lie free within the cavity of the knee joint, but is adherent to the capsule. The adherent tendon makes a prominent ridge on the inner surface of the capsule. The ridge is invested with the synovial membrane of the joint cavity both above and below the lateral meniscus. Between the upper and lower synovial reflexions the bare lateral meniscus is in contact with the bare tendon of popliteus, and the meniscus is often grooved by the tendon. Occasionally the tendon is partly attached to the meniscus in the manner shown in Figure 3.26.

The knee is the largest synovial joint in the body, but the amount of synovial fluid in a normal joint is about 0.5 ml – a mere capillary film. The attachment of the synovial membrane does not coincide with the capsular attachments, because of the intra-articular structures. On the femur it lines the intercondylar notch and on the lateral condyle is separated from the capsule by the attachment of popliteus tendon, which lies between the two. That is to say, it is attached all around the articular margin of the femur. On the tibia it is attached to the articular margins of medial and lateral condyles, and is reflected forwards over the anterior cruciate ligament from these margins. A fold extending from here to the inferior margin of the patella is known as the infrapatellar fold; an alar fold extends both medially and laterally from it. The infrapatellar fold and alar folds are produced by an extrasynovial fat pad and they adapt their shape to the contours of the bones in different positions of the knee. By keeping the synovial membrane in contact with the articular surfaces of the femoral condyles they act as Haversian fat pads (p. 12).

Communications with bursae characterize the synovial cavity of the knee joint. The communication with the suprapatellar bursa has already been noted. A herniation of synovial membrane beneath the rounded tendon of popliteus produces the banana-shaped popliteus bursa lying in the gutter between the tibia and the head of the fibula (Fig. 3.32). The bursa beneath the medial head of gastrocnemius always and that beneath the lateral head usually, communicate with the joint. The bursa under the medial head of gastrocnemius usually communicates also with the semimembranosus bursa (p. 170), thereby connecting the latter bursa with the cavity of the knee joint.

**Figure 3.32** Synovial membrane (distended) of the left knee joint, from behind. The semimembranosus bursa here communicates with the bursa under the medial head of gastrocnemius.

The capsule and joint structures are supplied from the anastomoses around the knee. The chief contributors are the five genicular branches of the popliteal artery, of which the middle genicular supplies the cruciate ligaments.

In accordance with Hilton's law the joint is supplied from the femoral, especially its branch to the vastus medialis, from the sciatic by the genicular branches of the tibial and common peroneal, and from the obturator nerve by the twig from its posterior division, which accompanies the femoral artery through the gap in the adductor magnus into the popliteal fossa. During arthroscopy it must be remembered that, although local anesthesia affects the overlying skin, the cruciate ligaments remain sensitive (tibial nerve). The menisci are virtually devoid of sensory fibers.

The movements of the knee joint are flexion, extension and rotation. Active rotation is possible only in a flexed knee. The passive rotation that occurs in the screw-home movement of full extension is something quite different. There is no active rotation of the extended knee.

Flexion is performed by the hamstrings and this is limited to about 150° by compression of the soft parts behind the knee. Extension is performed by the quadriceps and is limited by the tension of the anterior cruciate ligament, the oblique popliteal ligament and the collateral ligaments, but these four ligaments do not tighten simultaneously. As the knee moves into full extension the anterior cruciate ligament is the first to become taut. Extension of the lateral condyle of the femur is thus terminated. Further extension of the medial condyle is made possible by passive rotation forwards of the lateral condyle around the radius of the taut anterior cruciate ligament. This forces the medial condyle to glide backwards into its own full extension. The medial condyle has a longer and more curved articular surface than the lateral condyle for this very reason (Fig. 3.11). This medial rotation of the femur on the tibial plateau tightens the oblique popliteal ligament; the medial and lateral ligaments of the knee joint are set slightly obliquely and are tightened simultaneously. All three become taut and limit further rotation. This screw-home movement is said to lock the joint and the description is just. In this position the joint is slightly hyperextended and all four ligaments are taut – the anterior cruciate preventing further extension and the other three also preventing further rotation. The knee is completely rigid. It must be emphasized that these rotatory movements, which may amount to 15° or so, are purely passive and result from the skew pull of the obliquely set ligaments. They occur whether the extending force on the knee is active (quadriceps contraction) or passive, and have been shown radiologically to begin at a much earlier stage than the final screw-home. The lowest fibers of vastus medialis (those attached at right angles to the side of the patella) are of the very greatest importance in obtaining the final degrees of complete extension (p. 157).

From the screw-home or locked position lateral rotation of the femur must precede flexion; this lateral rotation is produced by the popliteus. The untwisted knee can now be flexed by the hamstrings.

The menisci are passively opened up in extension because a broader femoral condyle separates their anterior and posterior convexities (Fig. 3.33). Flexion and extension take place above the menisci, in the upper compartment of the joint. Rotation takes place below the menisci, in the lower compartment. The fact that the only mammal unable to rotate the knee (the fruit bat) is the only one to lack menisci and a popliteus muscle suggests that the menisci are associated with rotation, but the significance of this for the human knee is obscure. By their shape the menisci help to deepen slightly the tibial articular surfaces, like the glenoid labrum of the shoulder joint, and so perhaps play a small part in the stability of the joint. They also help to spread synovial fluid, but they are more important as shock-absorbers. They bear something like half the weight-bearing load in the upright position, distributing it over an area wider than that of the purely bony contact between the femur and tibia. The medial meniscus, being tethered to the medial ligament, is much less mobile than the lateral which, with its attachment to popliteus and to the femur by the meniscofemoral ligaments (Fig. 3.34) can get pulled out of the way, so it is not surprising that the medial meniscus is torn 20 times more often than the lateral.

**Figure 3.33** Articular contours of the left knee joint, from the lateral side. A. In extension, where the broader part of the femoral condyle separates the anterior and posterior parts of the meniscus. The heavy line indicates the attachment of the capsule, and the interrupted line the attachment of the synovial membrane; the tendon of popliteus intervenes. B. In flexion, where the narrower part of the condyle causes less separation of the meniscus.

**Figure 3.34** Left tibia and menisci from above. When the femur rotates laterally on the fixed tibia, the forward movement of the medial femoral condyle pulls forwards on the meniscofemoral ligaments, but forward movement of the lateral meniscus is prevented by the backward pull of popliteus.

Bony contours contribute nothing to the anteroposterior stability of the knee joint, but the spine of the tibia prevents sideways gliding of femur on tibia (try it on the dry bones!). The cruciate ligaments are indispensable to anteroposterior stability in flexion. Lateral stability and stability in extension are provided by the collateral and oblique popliteal ligaments. Muscle function is also vitally important; the vasti by their expansions (the retinacula) contribute greatly, and vastus medialis assists in the stability of the patella (p. 157). The iliotibial tract (gluteus maximus and tensor fasciae latae) stabilizes the slightly flexed knee (p. 151).

**Surgical approach.** The knee joint can be widely exposed from the front on either side of the patella by incisions through the vasti and alongside the patella and its ligament. A more limited approach to the medial meniscus with the knee flexed is along the medial side of the patella but with the incision extending no more than 1 cm below the upper margin of the tibia, to avoid damage to the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve which curves forwards below this level. Exposure of the back of the joint capsule through the popliteal fossa involves opening up the interval between the tibial nerve and semimembranosus, then displacing the nerve and popliteal vessels laterally and detaching the medial head of gastrocnemius from its origin. This head is also displaced laterally, so revealing the capsule and helping to protect the vessels and nerve. The middle genicular artery will require ligation.

**Aspiration.** Aspiration is usually carried out from the side at the upper lateral margin of the patella, the needle entering the suprapatellar bursa. For injection the joint is entered at the lower border of the patella on either side of the patellar ligament. The needle tip must not damage the menisci or joint surfaces. For arthroscopy the approach is on the lateral side of the patellar ligament.

## Front of the Leg

The front of the leg includes the subcutaneous surface of the tibia on the medial side and the extensor muscular compartment on the anterolateral side.

The cutaneous nerves are derived from the femoral nerve over the tibia and from the common peroneal nerve over the extensor compartment (Fig. 3.52). The saphenous nerve gives off its infrapatellar branch to supply the subcutaneous periosteum of the upper end of the tibia and the overlying skin and then descends just behind the great saphenous vein, with which it passes in front of the medial malleolus. It usually bifurcates 5-7 cm above the malleolus, and the branches run on each side of the vein. The main nerve (anterior branch) ends on the medial side of the foot at the bunion region — the metatarsophalangeal joint. The lateral cutaneous nerve of the calf, a branch of the common peroneal, supplies deep fascia and skin over the upper parts of the extensor and peroneal compartments and the superficial peroneal nerve replaces it over the rest of these surfaces.

The subcutaneous surface of the tibia has subcutaneous fat attached to its periosteum; there is no deep fascia covering it. The great saphenous vein and the saphenous nerve lie in the fat, accompanied by numerous lymphatic vessels which pass up from the foot to the vertical group of superficial inguinal nodes. This is an important part of the course of the great saphenous vein (p. 147) for here it has most of its deep connections. Along the medial side of the calf behind the medial border of the tibia a number of perforating (anastomotic) veins connect the great saphenous with deep veins of the calf (Fig. 3.2). There is usually one just below, one just above, and one about 10 cm above, the medial malleolus and another near the middle of the leg, but there may be others, including one just below knee level. Higher up there is also a constant and rather long perforator in the lower thigh joining the great saphenous or one of its tributaries to the femoral vein in the adductor canal. The lower perforators are frequently joined together by a superficial longitudinal trunk, the posterior arch vein, which usually joins the great saphenous some way below the knee. When traced deeply through the deep fascia, some of the perforating veins in the leg are seen to join the venae comitantes of the posterior tibial artery, while others join the venous plexus deep to soleus. The valves in the perforating veins are directed inwards and are found where the veins pierce the deep fascia and also where they join the deep veins. Much of the saphenous blood passes from superficial to deep through the perforators, to be pumped upwards in the deep veins by the contractions of soleus and other calf muscles. If the valves in the perforators become incompetent, pressure in the saphenous system increases and the veins become varicose. However, some of the smaller perforators do not have valves, and it appears normal for blood flow in them to occur in either direction.

The upper end of the subcutaneous surface of the shaft of the tibia receives the tendons of three muscles that converge from the three constituent parts of the hip bone (Fig. 3.54). They are sartorius (supplied by the femoral, the nerve of the ilium), gracilis (supplied by the obturator, the nerve of the pubis) and semitendinosus (supplied by the sciatic, or ischiadic, the nerve of the ischium) in that order from before backwards. The three tendons are separated by a bursa which lies deep to the flattened sartorius tendon (Fig. 3.35). When distended by fluid the extensions of the bursa alongside the tendons give a fancied resemblance to a goose's foot. The bursa was thus named *bursa anserina*.

**Figure 3.35** Three muscular guy ropes from the tibia to the pelvis.

It is noteworthy that all three muscles, running up from the tibia, are as widely separated above as the bony pelvis will allow (Fig. 3.35). Are they three guy ropes, helping to stabilize the bony pelvis? If so, it would explain the existence of sartorius and gracilis. Of sartorius we say it is a weak flexor and rotator of both hip and knee – but why have such a weak muscle when each joint already possesses its own powerful flexors and rotators? And gracilis is counted as a weak adductor of the thigh; why have a weak adductor when three other powerful adductors are already there? If indeed guy ropes were to be installed between the shin bone on which we stand and the mobile pelvis high above, they could not be situated to better advantage than are these three muscles.

The patellar ligament is received into a smooth area that lies obliquely on the tibial tuberosity. This insertion is situated entirely upon the epiphysis of the upper end of the tibia (Fig. 3.57). The patellar retinacula, fibrous expansions from the tendon of the quadriceps femoris, are inserted into the edges of the patella and patellar ligament and into the inferior borders of the tibial condyles. The prepatellar bursa (swollen in housemaid's knee) lies in front of the patella, but there are two infrapatellar bursae. The superficial infrapatellar bursa (swollen in clergyman's knee) lies in front of the patellar ligament, the deep infrapatellar bursa lies between the ligament and the upper part of the head of the tibia.

The deep fascia of the leg covers only muscles, being attached to periosteum at all places where bone is subcutaneous. Below the tibial condyles it encloses the muscles of the leg, being attached to anterior and posterior borders of the tibia. Above the ankle it is attached also to the lateral malleolus and the triangular subcutaneous area of the fibula. Two intermuscular septa pass from its deep surface to become attached to the fibula. They enclose the peroneal compartment. Between the anterior intermuscular septum and the tibia lies the extensor compartment, while between the posterior intermuscular septum and the tibia posteriorly lies the much more bulky flexor compartment or calf of the leg.

## Extensor Compartment

The compartment comprises the space between the deep fascia and the interosseous membrane, bounded medially by the extensor surface of the tibia and laterally by the extensor surface of the fibula and the anterior intermuscular septum. Its contained muscles are tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus and peroneus tertius, together with the deep peroneal nerve and anterior tibial vessels. In its lower extent the deep fascia does not encircle the leg but is attached to the subcutaneous border of the fibula above the lateral malleolus. Here the fascia is thickened to form the superior extensor retinaculum (Fig. 3.36), which is characterized by the fact that the tibialis anterior tendon perforates it, splitting off a lamina, so that there is a double attachment to the tibia. As it lies in the channel the tendon of tibialis anterior possesses a synovial sheath which continues down to its insertion. The other extensor tendons pass deep to the superior extensor retinaculum and at this level possess no synovial sheath. The muscle bellies lie lateral to the tibia but their tendons pass across its lower end beneath the superior retinaculum.

## Tibialis Anterior

This muscle has a spindle-shaped belly that molds the anterior subcutaneous border of the tibia into a reciprocal concavity. It arises from the upper two-thirds of the extensor surface of the tibia, from the interosseous membrane and, especially strongly, from the upper part of the deep fascia overlying it. It is pierced by the anterior tibial recurrent artery. The multipennate fibers converge conically downwards into a central tendon that pierces the superior extensor retinaculum, from which level the tendon is invested with a continuous synovial sheath. The pressure of the tendon rounds off the anterior border of the lower end of the tibia. Tendon and sheath are slung by the inferior extensor retinaculum (Fig. 3.36) and the tendon is inserted into a smooth facet at the anteroinferior angle of the medial cuneiform and into the adjacent part of the first metatarsal bone. A small bursa separates the tendon from the upper part of the facet.

Note that the tibialis anterior and peroneus longus are symmetrical in their insertions into opposite sides of the adjoining medial cuneiform and first metatarsal base, but tibialis anterior is inserted mainly into the cuneiform while peroneus longus tendon is inserted mainly into the metatarsal.

**Nerve supply.** By the deep peroneal and recurrent genicular nerves (L4).

**Action.** Combined dorsiflexion of the ankle joint and inversion of the foot (p. 207).

**Test.** The foot is dorsiflexed against resistance; the tendon can be seen and felt.

## Extensor Hallucis Longus

This muscle arises from the middle two-fourths of the fibula and the adjacent interosseous membrane. (Flexor hallucis longus, too, arises from the fibula.) The muscle lies deep at its origin, but emerges between tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus in the lower part of the leg. It passes beneath the superior extensor retinaculum, and is slung by the inferior extensor retinaculum, where it receives a separate synovial sheath. It passes along the medial side of the dorsum of the tibia across the superior tibiofibular joint. Much of the muscle gains origin from the anterior intermuscular septum and, to a less extent, from the deep fascia overlying it. It forms its four tendons over the lower part of the tibia, beneath the superior extensor retinaculum (Fig. 3.36). They are slung together by the inferior extensor retinaculum, and are here enclosed with the tendon of peroneus tertius in a common synovial sheath. The four tendons diverge slightly, superficial to extensor digitorum brevis, just beneath the deep fascia on the dorsum of the foot. They are inserted into the lateral four toes. Their mode of insertion is precisely the same as that of the extensor digitorum tendons in the hand. The tendon divides into three slips over the proximal phalanx, the central slip being inserted into the base of the middle phalanx. The two side slips reunite after being joined by the tendons of the interossei and lumbricals and are inserted into the base of the distal phalanx.

**Nerve supply.** By the deep peroneal nerve (L5, S1).

**Action.** To extend (i.e. dorsiflex) the lateral four toes.

**Test.** The four lateral toes are dorsiflexed against resistance; the tendons can be seen and felt, with some assistance in dorsiflexion of the ankle.

This arises from the upper three-quarters of the extensor surface of the fibula and from a small area of the tibia across the superior tibiofibular joint. Much of the muscle gains origin from the anterior intermuscular septum and, to a less extent, from the deep fascia overlying it. It forms its four tendons over the lower part of the tibia, beneath the superior extensor retinaculum (Fig. 3.36). They are slung together by the inferior extensor retinaculum, and are here enclosed with the tendon of peroneus tertius in a common synovial sheath. The four tendons diverge slightly, superficial to extensor digitorum brevis, just beneath the deep fascia on the dorsum of the foot. They are inserted into the lateral four toes. Their mode of insertion is precisely the same as that of the extensor digitorum tendons in the hand. The tendon divides into three slips over the proximal phalanx, the central slip being inserted into the base of the middle phalanx. The two side slips reunite after being joined by the tendons of the interossei and lumbricals and are inserted into the base of the distal phalanx.

## Peroneus Tertius

This arises from the lower third of the fibula below extensor digitorum longus. It is a unipennate muscle whose tendon forms anteriorly, in contact with the superior extensor retinaculum. It passes through the stem of the inferior retinaculum (Fig. 3.36) where it shares the synovial sheath of extensor digitorum longus and is inserted into the dorsum of the base of the fifth metatarsal bone and, by a falciform extension, into the superior surface of that bone as far forwards, in many cases, as its neck (Fig. 3.37).

**Nerve supply.** By the deep peroneal nerve (L5, S1).

**Action.** To dorsiflex and evert the foot. In spite of its small size it possesses fairly good mechanical advantage in dorsiflexion, since its tendon passes some distance in front of the axis of movement of the ankle and its insertion is so far forward on the foot.

The deep peroneal (deep fibular) nerve arises within peroneus longus, over the neck of the fibula, at the bifurcation of the common peroneal nerve. It spirals around the neck of the fibula deep to the fibers of extensor digitorum longus, and so reaches the interosseous membrane, on the lateral side of the anterior tibial vessels. With them it lies between extensor digitorum longus and tibialis anterior, the only two muscles in the upper part of the extensor compartment. In the middle of the leg the neurovascular bundle lies on the interosseous membrane between the tibial and fibular muscles, i.e. tibialis anterior and extensor hallucis longus. The latter muscle crosses the bundle, so that over the lower end of the tibia the tendons of two muscles lie on each side of the bundle (tibialis anterior and extensor hallucis longus medially, and extensor digitorum longus and peroneus tertius laterally). At this level the deep peroneal nerve has regained its position lateral to the vessels.

The deep peroneal nerve supplies the four muscles of the extensor compartment of the leg, and is sensory to the periosteum of the extensor surfaces of tibia and fibula. For its further course in the foot, see page 191.

The anterior tibial artery, formed at the bifurcation of the popliteal artery in the calf, passes forwards above the upper border of the interosseous membrane to reach the extensor compartment. In doing so it lies nearer the fibula than the tibia, with a companion vein on each side. The fibular companion vein may leave a notch in the fibula, visible in a radiograph. The artery with its companion veins runs vertically downwards on the interosseous membrane and crosses the lower end of the tibia at the front of the ankle joint, midway between the malleoli, where it changes its name to the dorsalis pedis artery. It gives off a recurrent branch, which pierces tibialis anterior, to the arterial anastomosis around the upper end of the tibia, supplies the muscles of the extensor compartment and gives malleolar branches to both malleolar regions.

Tibialis anterior lies to its medial side of the artery throughout. Extensor digitorum longus and peroneus tertius lie to its lateral side throughout. Extensor hallucis longus crosses it from fibular to tibial sides. The deep peroneal nerve reaches it from the lateral side, runs in front of it in the crowded space of the middle of the leg and returns to its lateral side below. The anterior tibial veins run, one on each side of the artery, in close contact with it and anastomose by cross channels at frequent intervals.

The fibula articulates with the femur in the embryo, but differential growth of tibia and fibula results in the latter sinking below the level of the plateau of the tibia and making a separate tibiofibular articulation. This is a synovial joint, with capsule and synovial membrane. The lower ends of the two bones are strongly bound together by ligamentous fibers to form a fibrous joint and the two bones are further held together by an interosseous membrane which connects their interosseous borders. The nature of the tibiofibular articulations varies widely from animal to animal, and suppression of upper or lower end of the fibula is quite common.

The presence of a synovial joint at the upper ends of the two bones in man indicates movement, but this movement is entirely passive and depends upon the variable shape of the talus. The fibular malleolus maintains intimate contact with the lateral surface of the talus in all positions of the ankle joint. The lateral surface of the talus is usually convex in an anteroposterior direction, so that dorsiflexion and plantar flexion at the ankle joint produce rotation of the fibula around its own axis. In such cases the superior tibiofibular joint surfaces are more nearly horizontal, to allow rotation to occur. If the lateral surface of the talus is plane, the superior tibial and fibular facets are more nearly vertical.

The superior tibiofibular joint, with these variations in the direction of its surface, is surrounded by a capsule (Fig. 3.30) whose fibers are thickened anteriorly and posteriorly and from the tibia slope downwards to the fibula. The joint cavity may communicate posteriorly with the bursa under the popliteus tendon and thence with the knee joint.

The interosseous membrane consists of strong fibers that slope steeply from the tibia down to the fibula. They do more than bind the bones together, for they resist downward movement of the fibula when the powerful fibular muscles pull on it (flexor hallucis longus, the peronei, extensor hallucis and digitorum longus). The only muscle exerting an upward pull on the fibula is the biceps femoris.

The inferior tibiofibular joint is a fibrous joint, the two bones being strongly bound together by the interosseous tibiofibular ligament whose fibers occupy the triangular area on each bone at the lower end of the interosseous border (Fig. 3.61).

The skin of the dorsum of the foot is supplied by the superficial peroneal nerve, assisted slightly by the deep peroneal, saphenous, and sural nerves (Fig. 3.52). The large veins form a dorsal venous arch which receives most of its blood by marginal and interosseous tributaries from the sole of the foot. The dorsal venous arch, lying over the heads of the metatarsals, drains from its medial and lateral ends into the great and small saphenous veins respectively.

The superficial peroneal (superficial fibular) nerve surfaces at the middle of the leg (Fig. 3.36). It passes downwards over the peronei and divides above the ankle into medial and lateral branches which supply the skin of the dorsum of the foot. The medial branch further divides to supply the medial side of the dorsum of the great toe and the sides of the second cleft. The lateral branch divides to supply the third and fourth clefts. The nerve and its divisions are visible in a thin leg when stretched by plantarflexion of the foot. The lateral side of the foot and lateral side of the little toe are supplied by the sural nerve, while the first cleft is supplied by the deep peroneal nerve. The terminal phalanges and toenails are supplied by the medial and lateral plantar nerves. The medial side of the foot as far forward as the bunion area (metatarsophalangeal joint) is supplied by the termination of the saphenous nerve.

The inferior extensor retinaculum arises by a stem from the anterior part of the upper surface of the calcaneus, on the lateral border of the dorsum of the foot (Fig. 3.36). From the stem two limbs diverge. The upper limb is attached to the medial malleolus, the lower limb arches across the tendons on the dorsum and blends with the plantar aponeurosis under the medial longitudinal arch of the foot. The tendons are usually said to pierce the extensor retinaculum, but this is not strictly true. Most of the inferior retinacular fibers sling around the tendons and return to be attached to the calcaneus, and only the superficial fibers pass across to the insertions mentioned at the medial malleolus and plantar aponeurosis (Fig. 3.40). All the extensor tendons are enclosed in synovial sheaths where they are slung in the inferior extensor retinaculum.

This is a muscle whose fleshy belly can be seen in most feet and felt in all. It arises from the upper surface of the calcaneus and from the deep surface of the stem of the Y-shaped inferior extensor retinaculum. It passes obliquely across the dorsum of the foot and gives off four tendons to the medial four toes. The tendon to the great toe is different from the others and is deservedly given a special name, extensor hallucis brevis. Its belly usually separates early from the main muscle mass and the tendon is inserted separately into the base of the proximal phalanx of the great toe. As in the thumb, so in the great toe there is no dorsal extensor expansion. The remaining three tendons are inserted into the dorsal extensor expansions of the second, third and fourth toes. All four tendons of the muscle pass deep to the tendons of extensor digitorum longus.

**Action.** To extend the medial four toes. It is particularly of value when the long extensor is out of action, in the fully dorsiflexed ankle, as in the moment just before the take-off from the hind foot in walking, running, and jumping. The toes thus extended lengthen the grip of the foot on the ground, and this provides a faster propulsive take-off.

**Test.** The toes are dorsiflexed and the muscle belly towards the lateral side of the dorsum (not the tendons) is observed and palpated.

The anterior tibial artery, lying over the lower end of the tibia midway between the malleoli, extends forwards as the dorsalis pedis artery (Fig. 3.36). This runs to the base of the first intermetatarsal space and passes down into the sole, where it joins the lateral plantar artery to complete the plantar arch. It lies between the tendon of extensor hallucis longus medially and the digital branch of the deep peroneal nerve laterally, and it is crossed by the tendon of extensor hallucis brevis. Its pulsation can be felt lateral to the extensor hallucis longus tendon on a line from the midpoint between the two malleoli towards the first toe cleft. Beware of a twitching extensor tendon that can be mistaken for this pulse! Occasionally the vessel is replaced by an enlarged perforating peroneal artery in front of the lateral malleolus. It has three named branches. The lateral tarsal artery runs laterally beneath extensor digitorum brevis, to supply that muscle and the underlying tarsal bones. The arcuate artery runs laterally beneath the tendons of extensor digitorum brevis over the bases of the metatarsal bones. It gives off dorsal metatarsal arteries to supply the lateral three clefts. Each metatarsal artery gives off a perforating branch at the posterior and anterior end of its intermetatarsal space to communicate with the plantar arch and its digital branches. It is the accompanying perforating veins that are responsible for bringing much of the blood from the sole of the foot through the intermetatarsal spaces to the dorsal venous arch. The first dorsal metatarsal artery, a direct continuation of the dorsalis pedis, supplies the first cleft and the medial side of the dorsum of the great toe.

The deep peroneal (deep fibular) nerve crosses the tibia lateral to the artery, midway between the malleoli. It passes forward, deep to the tendons, on the lateral side of the dorsalis pedis artery, to pierce the deep fascia and supply the first cleft. It gives off a branch which curves laterally beneath the muscle belly of extensor digitorum brevis and supplies this muscle and the underlying periosteum and joint capsules. It may also give a branch as an additional supply to the first dorsal interosseous muscle.

## Peroneal Compartment

This muscular compartment lies between the peroneal surface of the fibula and deep fascia of the leg and is bounded in front and behind by the anterior and posterior intermuscular septa. It contains the peroneus longus and brevis muscles and the superficial peroneal nerve. Its blood supply is derived from branches of the peroneal artery which pierce flexor hallucis longus and the posterior intermuscular septum. Its veins drain, for the most part, into the small saphenous vein.

Peroneus longus arises from the upper two-thirds of the peroneal surface of the fibula, from the head of that bone and, across the superior tibiofibular joint, from a small area of the lateral tibial condyle. Its fibers take origin also from the intermuscular septa. Peroneus brevis arises from the lower two-thirds of the fibula; in the middle third of the bone its origin lies in front of that of peroneus longus and the two muscles and their tendons maintain this relationship.

The broad tendon of peroneus brevis lies behind (and grooves) the lateral malleolus. The narrower tendon of peroneus longus lies on that of brevis and does not come into contact with the malleolus (Fig. 3.39). The two tendons pass forwards to the peroneal trochlea on the lateral surface of the calcaneus, which separates them. The tendon of brevis passes above the peroneal trochlea to be inserted into the tip of the tubercle (styloid process) at the base of the fifth metatarsal bone. The tendon of peroneus longus passes below the peroneal trochlea and enters the sole of the foot, lying against the posterior ridge of the groove on the cuboid bone. Here the tendon possesses a sesamoid fibrocartilage which often ossifies. The tendon crosses the sole obliquely to be inserted into the base of the first metatarsal and the adjoining part of the medial cuneiform (Fig. 3.44).

The tendons are bound down at the lateral malleolus by the superior peroneal retinaculum, a band of deep fascia that extends from the tip of the malleolus to the calcaneus, and at the peroneal trochlea by the inferior peroneal retinaculum (Fig. 3.37). This is a band of fascia attached to the peroneal trochlea and to the calcaneus above and below the peroneal tendons. Its upper part is continuous with the stem of the Y-shaped inferior extensor retinaculum. The two tendons are enclosed in a common synovial sheath from above the lateral malleolus to the peroneal trochlea, where the sheath divides to accompany each tendon separately to its insertion.

**Nerve supplies.** Both muscles are supplied by the superficial peroneal nerve (L5, S1).

**Action.** Both muscles evert, and weakly plantarflex, the foot; they are the plantarflexors when the tibial nerve is paralyzed. In addition, peroneus longus is a factor in maintaining the lateral longitudinal and transverse arches of the foot (p. 211).

**Test.** The foot is everted and the tendons can be seen and felt below the lateral malleolus.

The superficial peroneal (superficial fibular) nerve begins in the substance of peroneus longus at the division of the common peroneal nerve. It passes downwards in the muscle and emerges at its anterior border behind the anterior intermuscular septum. It supplies both peronei and pierces the deep fascia halfway down the leg and soon divides into medial and lateral branches. In thin individuals these can be seen or felt as ridges under the skin if they are put on the stretch by full plantar flexion of the foot (Fig. 3.37). The distribution on the dorsum of the foot has been described on page 190.

## Calf

This is commonly called the calf. The skin of the calf is supplied by the termination of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve halfway to the ankle. Below this level the sural and peroneal communicating nerves, from tibial and common peroneal nerves, supply the back and lateral side of the calf, and the saphenous nerve supplies the medial side (Fig. 3.53).

The small (short) saphenous vein, draining the lateral side of the dorsal venous arch and the lateral margin of the foot lies with the sural nerve behind the lateral malleolus. It passes upwards in the subcutaneous fat along the midline of the calf and pierces the deep fascia anywhere from midcalf to the roof of the popliteal fossa, where it enters the popliteal vein; it may thus run for some distance beneath the deep fascia. It communicates by several channels with the great saphenous vein (p. 185).

The deep fascia is a continuation downwards from the popliteal fascia and is attached to the posterior border of the tibia. It surrounds the calf and the peroneal and extensor compartments to become attached to the anterior border of the tibia. Where the lower end of the fibula becomes subcutaneous the deep fascia is attached to the periosteum. The posterior intermuscular septum divides the calf from the peroneal compartment.

At the ankle the deep fascia is thickened by transverse fibers to form the superior extensor retinaculum (p. 186) and the flexor retinaculum. The flexor retinaculum is a strong band of deep fascia that extends from the medial malleolus to the back of the calcaneus, and forms the flexor retinaculum.

The muscles of the calf, the posterior compartment of the leg, fall into superficial and deep groups. The superficial muscles consist of gastrocnemius, plantaris and soleus which all converge on a thick tendon at the back of the heel, the tendo calcaneus or Achilles tendon. They are the main plantarflexors of the ankle joint. The deep group includes popliteus (which has been more conveniently described with the popliteal fossa, p. 173), and three muscles – flexor digitorum longus, flexor hallucis longus and tibialis posterior – whose tendons pass under the flexor retinaculum into the sole of the foot. The nerve of the posterior compartment is the tibial part of the sciatic, and the arteries are the posterior tibial (from the popliteal) and its peroneal branch. Refer to Figure 3.38 when the above structures are being studied.

**Figure 3.38** Cross-section of the middle of the right upper leg, looking towards the knee. Tibialis posterior is the deepest calf muscle, immediately behind the interosseous membrane. Note the many veins associated with soleus – a potential site of dangerous deep venous thrombosis.

Examine the lower end of a femur. The epiphyseal junction passes transversely through the adductor tubercle. The lateral head of gastrocnemius arises from the epiphysis, the medial head from both epiphysis and shaft; plantaris arises from the shaft. The lateral head of gastrocnemius arises on the lateral surface of the lateral condyle, by a tendon that leaves a smooth pit above that of popliteus; the pits are separated by the epicondyle (Fig. 3.33A). A few fleshy fibers arise from the condyle above the pit, towards the lower end of the lateral supracondylar line. The medial head of gastrocnemius arises by a tendon from a smooth shallow pit on the medial condyle at the lower end of the medial supracondylar line and by muscular fibers from an area of roughened bone on the popliteal surface of the shaft of the femur (Figs 3.56 and 3.26). In the fetus the medial head, like the lateral, arises wholly from the epiphysis; the upward extension of this origin to encroach on the popliteal surface of the shaft of the femur is a postnatal event.

The two heads converge to lie side by side, where the broad bellies of the muscle have a dense aponeurosis beneath them, bearing on the soleus muscle. The medial head is longer at each end; it extends below the lateral head, as inspection of the living calf will show. The flat aponeurosis blends with that of soleus at the lower border of the lateral head. In the midline it blends with soleus aponeurosis by a criss-cross exchange of fibers. The medial half of the aponeurosis is separate from soleus down to the heel, and the slender tendon of plantaris lies between. A bursa lies between the medial head and the capsule over the medial condyle of the femur. It communicates with the knee joint and it may communicate also with the semimembranosus bursa (Fig. 3.32).

The aponeurosis forms, with that of soleus, the tendo calcaneus (Achilles tendon), which is inserted into a smooth transverse area on the middle third of the posterior surface of the calcaneus. A bursa lies between it and the upper part of the calcaneus. A second bursa lies between it and the thickened deep fascia 2 inches above its insertion; inflammation here is frequently miscalled tenosynovitis. There is no synovial sheath around the tendo calcaneus (Fig. 3.37).

Plantaris is a vestigial muscle showing the short belly and long tendon said to indicate phylogenetic degeneration. It arises from the shaft of the femur at the lower part of the lateral supracondylar line, lying edge to edge with the lateral head of gastrocnemius (Fig. 3.22). Its slender tendon runs deep to the medial head of gastrocnemius and down the midline of the calf, between the aponeuroses of gastrocnemius and soleus (Fig. 3.40), to the calcaneus at the medial side of the tendo calcaneus. The tendon is flat as it lies sandwiched between the two aponeuroses, but it can be unraveled and proves to be a wide ribbon twisted spirally upon itself.

## Soleus

There is great morphological resemblance between soleus in the leg and flexor digitorum superficialis in the forearm. Structurally they are different. Flexor digitorum superficialis has parallel fibers for range of movement of the fingers, soleus is multipennate for power in propulsion. The flexor digitorum brevis muscle in the sole of the foot can be regarded as the divorced distal part of soleus, cut off from it by the posterior projection of the calcaneus.

The muscle arises from the fibula and tibia, mostly the tibia. The upper fourth of the fibula, including the head of the bone, gives some origin to the muscle, whence a fibrous arch (which bridges over the popliteal vessels and tibial nerve) carries it in continuity to the soleal line of the tibia and the fascia upon popliteus above this line, and so along the posterior border of the middle third of the tibia, that is, a hand's breadth below the lower end of the soleal line (Fig. 3.39A). The muscle has a curious and characteristic structure: it is flat, and there is a dense aponeurosis upon either surface. Between the two aponeurotic lamellae lies the great bulk of the soleus, made up of muscle fibers that slope downwards from the anterior to the posterior lamella; these fleshy fibers are visible at the medial and lateral borders of the muscle. The posterior (superficial) lamella is continued at its lower end into the tendo calcaneus, and the muscle fibers of soleus are received into its deep surface down to within a short distance of the calcaneus. The tendo calcaneus is received into a smooth transverse area across the middle third of the posterior surface of the calcaneus (Fig. 3.62).

If the soleus is detached from its fibular origin and turned aside the anterior surface is brought into view. Here a slender bipennate muscle belly is attached to the center of the aponeurosis. This belly lies on the neurovascular bundle, in the groove between flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus. Branches from the posterior tibial vessels perforate the aponeurosis.

Perforating veins from the great saphenous vein enter the substance of soleus. The muscle contains a rich plexus of small veins, and these are pumped empty by contraction of the muscle, thus aiding venous return. Stagnation in these veins predisposes to deep vein thrombosis and the danger of pulmonary embolism (Fig. 3.38). The soleal pump is aided by the sole pump (p. 203).

**Figure 3.39** Deep muscles of the right calf. A. The origin of flexor digitorum longus (with flexor hallucis longus removed). B. Showing flexor digitorum longus crossing superficial to tibialis posterior in the lower calf and to flexor hallucis longus in the sole. Tibialis posterior and flexor hallucis longus are parallel.

**Nerve supply.** All three muscles are supplied by the tibial nerve (S1, 2). Each head of gastrocnemius receives a branch from the nerve in the popliteal fossa, where the small branch to plantaris also arises. Soleus receives two branches, one from above the muscle in the popliteal fossa and one on its deep surface in the calf. In cases of intractable intermittent claudication both branches must be cut if soleus is to be completely denervated.

**Actions.** Soleus and gastrocnemius act together on the tendo calcaneus; the action of the weak vestigial plantaris is negligible. The powerful multipennate soleus is an antigravity muscle. In standing it contracts alternately with the extensor muscles of the leg to maintain balance. It is a very strong but relatively slow plantar flexor of the ankle joint, a necessary mechanical result of the obliquity of its multipennate fibers. The gastrocnemius bellies are not multipennate; their fibers all lie roughly vertical in the long axis of the leg. They provide the necessary whip-like contraction that aids rapid propulsion. This action is greatly increased if the flexed knee is simultaneously extended, for the origin of the contracting muscle is thereby pulled upwards and the tendo calcaneus with it. In propulsion the powerful, multipennate soleus overcomes the inertia of the body weight (bottom gear), and when movement is under way the quicker-acting gastrocnemius greatly increases the speed of movement (top gear). One strolls along with soleus, but runs with gastrocnemius.

## Deep Muscles

The deep muscles of the calf consist of flexor digitorum longus, flexor hallucis longus and tibialis posterior. Their three tendons pass under the flexor retinaculum into the sole of the foot. Those of tibialis posterior and flexor hallucis longus are parallel throughout their course, the tibialis medial to the hallucis. The tendon of flexor digitorum longus takes an oblique course superficial to both. In the calf it lies medially, crosses tibialis posterior to lie under the flexor retinaculum between the two, and in the sole it crosses flexor hallucis longus to pass to the lateral four toes (Fig. 3.39B).

## Flexor Digitorum Longus

This muscle is often described inaccurately. It is a bipennate muscle that arises from both bones of the leg. Its tibial origin is by flesh from the posterior surface of the bone below the soleal line, but, by virtue of the intermuscular septa in this region, it can also be shown to arise from the fibula by a broad aponeurosis whose oblique fibers are replaced by flesh to form the lateral half of the bipennate muscle (Fig. 3.39A). The tendon forms centrally in the bipennate mass and slopes downwards across the tendon of tibialis posterior in the lower part of the leg. Passing beneath the flexor retinaculum it enters the sole of the foot, and crosses the tendon of flexor hallucis longus. At this point it divides into four tendons, the medial two of which receive a strong slip from the tendon of flexor hallucis longus. The four tendons at their commencement receive the insertion of the flexor accessorius muscle. More distally each gives origin to a lumbrical muscle. The tendons pass into the fibrous flexor sheaths of the lateral four toes, perforate the tendons of flexor digitorum brevis, and are inserted into the bases of the distal phalanges (for lumbricals, see p. 199).

**Action.** Its principal action is to plantarflex the lateral four toes and, secondarily, to plantarflex the ankle joint. Its tonus is, with that of the other deep calf muscles, indispensable in maintaining the longitudinal arch of the foot.

## Flexor Hallucis Longus

This is the bulkiest and most powerful of the three deep muscles of the calf and its importance is usually not given due credit. It is a multipennate muscle whose fibers arise from the flexor surface of the fibula and from the adjoining aponeurosis of the flexor digitorum longus. Below this the muscle arises in continuity from the whole flexor surface of the fibula and the lower part of the interosseous membrane (Fig. 3.60).

The fibers spiral down to be inserted into a central tendon which escapes from the muscle just at the lower end of the tibia. Beef to the heel describes the flexor hallucis longus. The tendon grooves the posterior process of the talus and the under surface of the sustentaculum tali (Figs 3.50 and 3.64), from which it passes directly forwards like a bowstring beneath the arched medial border of the foot to be inserted into the base of the distal phalanx of the great toe.

It is crossed in the sole by the tendons of flexor digitorum longus (Fig. 3.39B) and gives a strong slip to the medial two of these (those for the second and third toes). The peroneal artery runs down deep to it on the fibular aponeurosis of flexor digitorum longus. The artery is covered by a fibrous roof on the deep surface of flexor hallucis longus.

**Action.** Its principal action is to flex the great toe, and it is significant that this is the take-off point, the last part to leave the ground in propulsion. It plantarflexes the ankle joint simultaneously. In addition, the pull of this powerful muscle is the most important single factor in maintaining the medial longitudinal arch of the foot (p. 210).

**Tests.** The terminal phalanges of the great toe (for flexor hallucis longus) and of other toes (for flexor digitorum longus) are flexed against resistance.

This muscle arises from the interosseous membrane and the adjoining surface of both bones of the leg below the origin of soleus and from the fibular aponeurosis of flexor digitorum longus. It is pierced by the nutrient artery of the tibia. It is a unipennate muscle, the tendon emerging from its medial side and lying in close contact with the edge of the tibia. The tendon grooves the back of the medial malleolus (Fig. 3.39A); the groove in life is deepened by fibrocartilage which is lost from the dried bone. It passes forward above the medial side of the sustentaculum tali, and is inserted into the tuberosity of the navicular. The glib statement that it is inserted into every bone of the tarsus except the talus is misleading (see p. 202). Most of the expansions that pass from its insertion on the navicular to other tarsal bones are ligaments in their own right, and not extensions of the tendon. Its blood supply is derived from the peroneal artery by branches that pierce the aponeurosis of flexor digitorum longus. Very few branches of the posterior tibial artery reach the muscle, which is pierced by the nutrient artery to the tibia.

**Action.** To invert and adduct the forefoot and, since it passes behind the medial malleolus, to plantarflex the ankle joint.

**Test.** With the foot in slight plantarflexion, it is inverted against resistance; the tendon can be seen and felt behind the medial malleolus.

The posterior tibial artery arises at the lower border of the popliteus, where the popliteal artery divides into anterior and posterior tibial branches. It passes under the fibrous arch in the origin of soleus and runs down on the fibular aponeurosis of flexor digitorum longus, between the muscle bellies of that muscle and flexor hallucis longus. It ends under the flexor retinaculum by dividing into medial and lateral plantar arteries at a slightly higher level than the point of bifurcation of the tibial nerve. It is accompanied throughout its course by a pair of venae comitantes which communicate with each other at frequent intervals around the artery.

The pulsation of the artery is felt at the level of the medial malleolus, 2.5 cm in front of the medial border of the tendo calcaneus; it is often the most difficult to feel of the lower limb pulses. It can also be exposed here, e.g. for making an arteriovenous shunt with the great saphenous vein for hemodialysis.

**Branches.** The nutrient artery to the tibia is the largest single nutrient artery in either limb. The vessel pierces the fibular aponeurosis of flexor digitorum longus, passes medially beneath the muscle and then downwards into the bone between the tibial origins of flexor digitorum longus and tibialis posterior.

The peroneal (fibular) artery arises an inch below the commencement of the posterior tibial and runs into a tunnel whose fibrous roof gives attachment to muscle fibers of flexor hallucis longus. It gives muscular branches that perforate the fibular aponeurosis of flexor digitorum longus to supply tibialis posterior and others that wind around the fibula to supply peroneus longus and brevis. It gives a nutrient artery to the fibula. It ends by dividing into a perforating branch which pierces the interosseous membrane to enter the extensor compartment and a lateral calcanean branch which ramifies behind the lateral malleolus and over the lateral side of the heel.

The tibial nerve runs straight down the midline of the calf, deep to soleus, lying on the fibular aponeurosis of flexor digitorum longus. The posterior tibial artery is at first lateral to it, but passes deep to it at the origin of its peroneal branch and continues downwards on its medial side. The nerve ends under the middle of the flexor retinaculum by dividing into the medial and lateral plantar nerves, at a slightly lower level than the bifurcation of the artery (Fig. 3.40). Its surface marking is from the middle of the popliteal fossa to behind the medial malleolus.

It is the nerve of the flexor compartment, giving muscular branches to the deep surface of soleus, to flexors digitorum longus and hallucis longus, and tibialis posterior. It gives off several cutaneous twigs, the medial calcanean nerves, to the skin of the heel, including the weight-bearing surface (Fig. 3.40).

## Part 10: Sole of the Foot

The skin is supplied posteriorly, over the weight-bearing part of the heel, by the medial calcanean branches of the tibial nerve. The sole is supplied from the medial and lateral plantar nerves by branches that perforate the plantar aponeurosis along each edge of the strong central portion. Blood vessels accompany all the cutaneous nerves of the sole. The plantar surfaces of the toes are supplied by digital branches of the medial (three and a half toes) and lateral (one and a half toes) plantar nerves. Note that the plantar digital nerves supply skin on the dorsum of each toe proximal to the nail bed. Compare the median and ulnar nerve distributions to the fingers; they are identical.

The subcutaneous tissue in the sole, as in the palm, differs from that of the rest of the body in being more fibrous. Fibrous septa divide the tissue into small loculi which are filled with a rather fluid fat under tension, so that the cut tissue bulges. This makes a shock-absorbing pad, especially over the heel. The septa anchor the skin to the underlying plantar aponeurosis, to improve the grip of the sole.

The plantar aponeurosis covers the whole length of the sole (Fig. 3.41). It arises posteriorly from the medial and lateral tubercles of the calcaneus and from the back of that bone below the insertion of the tendo calcaneus. It fans out over the sole and is inserted by five slips, into each of the five toes. The digital slips bifurcate for the passage of the flexor tendons and are inserted around the edges of the fibrous flexor sheaths and into the transverse ligaments that bind together the metatarsal heads. From each edge of the plantar aponeurosis a septum penetrates the sole, separating the flexor digitorum brevis from the abductors of big and little toes. The septa are attached to the first and fifth metatarsal bones. The abductors of the big and little toes, lying along the margins of the sole, are covered by deep fascia that is much thinner than the dense plantar aponeurosis.

The muscles of the sole of the foot are arranged in layers, as are those of the palm (see p. 104). Four layers are conventionally described. The superficial consists of three short muscles that cover the sole, beneath the plantar aponeurosis. Next lies the second layer, consisting of long tendons to the digits, and their connections. The third layer consists of the short muscles of the great and little toes; it is confined to the metatarsal region of the foot. The fourth layer consists of both plantar and dorsal interossei and it includes also the tendons of peroneus longus and tibialis posterior. Apart from these last two tendons all pass to the toes, so naturally the shortest muscles lie deepest.

## First Layer

Three short muscles lie side by side along the sole of the foot. The central of these, flexor digitorum brevis, is the counterpart of flexor superficialis in the upper limb, and is represented in the palm by the four tendons of that muscle.

Flexor digitorum brevis arises from the medial tubercle of the calcaneus and its fleshy belly lies in contact with the strong central part of the plantar aponeurosis. It divides into four tendons which pass to the lateral four toes. Each tendon enters the fibrous flexor sheath on the plantar aspect of its digit (Fig. 3.42), divides and spirals around the long flexor tendon, and partially reunites in a chiasma before dividing again to be inserted into the sides of the middle phalanx. This is an identical arrangement with that of the flexor digitorum superficialis.

**Nerve supply.** By the medial plantar nerve (S2, 3).

**Action.** To flex the toes with equal effect in any position of the ankle joint.

Abductor hallucis arises from the medial tubercle of the calcaneus and high up from the deep fascia that overlies it. It runs along the medial margin of the foot (Fig. 3.42) to be inserted into the medial side of the proximal phalanx of the great toe.

Abductor digiti minimi has an unexpectedly wide origin, from both medial and lateral tubercles of the calcaneus, deep to the origin of flexor digitorum brevis. It lies side by side with the latter muscle, along the lateral margin of the foot (Fig. 3.42). Its tendon is inserted into the lateral side of the proximal phalanx of the fifth toe. Some of its medial fibers are usually inserted into the tubercle of the fifth metatarsal bone.

**Nerve supply.** By a branch from the main trunk of the lateral plantar nerve (S2, 3).

**Action.** It abducts the little toe, an action, however, which is retained but little in modern man.

## Second Layer

This consists of the long flexor tendons and their connections in the sole.

The tendon of flexor hallucis longus passes forward like a bowstring beneath the medial longitudinal arch of the foot (Fig. 3.50). Posteriorly it lies in a groove beneath the sustentaculum tali. Further forward it is crossed by the tendon of flexor digitorum longus, to the medial two of whose divisions it gives off a strong slip. It next lies in a groove between the two sesamoids beneath the head of the first metatarsal bone, and finally is inserted into the base of the distal phalanx of the big toe. It is invested by a synovial sheath throughout its whole course in the foot.

The tendon of flexor digitorum longus enters the sole on the medial side of the tendon of flexor hallucis longus. At its point of division into its four tendons of insertion it crosses superficial to the tendon of flexor hallucis longus, which gives a strong slip to the tendons for the second and third toes. At this point it also receives the insertion of flexor accessorius (Fig. 3.42). The four tendons pass forwards in the sole deep to those of flexor digitorum brevis and after giving off the lumbricals they enter the fibrous sheaths of the lateral four toes. Each tendon perforates the tendon of flexor digitorum brevis and passes on to be inserted into the base of the distal phalanx.

Flexor accessorius (quadratus plantae) arises by a large medial head which is fleshy and by a small lateral head which is tendinous. The medial head arises from the medial surface of the calcaneus almost as far back as its posterior border and from the medial tubercle (Figs 3.40 and 3.42). The lateral head is a flat tendon which arises from the lateral tubercle of the calcaneus and converges to the muscle belly. The posterior part of the long plantar ligament is visible in the triangular interval between the two heads. The muscle belly is inserted into the tendon of flexor digitorum longus at the point where it is bound by a fibrous slip to the tendon of flexor hallucis longus and where it breaks up into its four tendons of insertion.

**Action.** By pulling on the tendons of flexor digitorum longus, it provides a means of flexing the lateral four toes in any position of the ankle joint, particularly in full plantarflexion (here the flexor digitorum longus is so shortened as to be out of action). It also straightens the pull of the long flexor tendons on the toes.

The muscle is known as quadratus plantae in North America, but the name accessory flexor is better, for it indicates the role of the muscle.

The lumbrical muscles arise from the tendons of flexor digitorum longus, and pass forward on the medial (tibial, or preaxial, as in the hand) sides of the metatarsophalangeal joints of the lateral four toes (Fig. 3.42). Their tendons lie on the plantar surfaces of the deep transverse ligament of the metatarsal heads and pass dorsally to be inserted into the extensor expansions.

**Nerve supply.** As in the hand, a lumbrical supplied by the medial plantar (cf. median) nerve is unicipital, one supplied by the lateral plantar (cf. ulnar) nerve is bicipital. In the foot only the first lumbrical is supplied by the medial plantar nerve; it arises by a single head from its own tendon. The lateral three lumbricals are supplied by the lateral plantar nerve (deep branch) and each arises by two heads from the adjoining sides of the tendons.

**Action.** The lumbricals maintain extension of the digits at the interphalangeal joints while the flexor digitorum longus tendons are flexing the toes, so that in walking and running the toes do not buckle under.

## Third Layer

Flexor hallucis brevis arises from the under surface of the cuboid by a slender slip and from the under surfaces of all three cuneiforms, blending here with the expansions from the insertion of tibialis posterior. The belly of the muscle splits into two parts whose edges are in contact. They are inserted, each by way of a sesamoid bone, into the medial and lateral sides of the base of the plantar surface of the proximal phalanx of the great toe. The medial insertion blends with that of abductor hallucis, the lateral with that of adductor hallucis.

Adductor hallucis has two heads, an oblique and a transverse. The oblique head (Fig. 3.43) is the larger and arises from the bases of the second, third and fourth metatarsal bones. The slender transverse head (Fig. 3.42) has no bony origin; it arises from the deep transverse ligament and from the under surfaces of the lateral four metatarsophalangeal joints. The two heads unite (Fig. 3.43) in a short tendon which is inserted, with the lateral insertion of flexor hallucis brevis, into the lateral side of the plantar surface of the base of the proximal phalanx of the big toe.

**Nerve supply.** By the deep branch of the lateral plantar nerve (S2, 3) which sinks into the muscle.

**Action.** The muscle draws the big toe towards the axis of the metatarsus and thus assists in maintaining the transverse arch.

Flexor digiti minimi brevis arises from the base of the fifth metatarsal bone and the adjoining fibrous sheath of peroneus longus. The muscle belly lies along the under surface of the fifth metatarsal bone (Fig. 3.43) and its tendon is inserted into the base of the proximal phalanx medial to the insertion of abductor digiti minimi.

**Nerve supply.** By the superficial branch of the lateral plantar nerve (S2, 3).

**Action.** To assist in flexing the little toe.

## Fourth Layer

The fourth layer of muscles consists of the interossei in the intermetatarsal spaces. The tendons of tibialis posterior and peroneus longus, lying deeply against the under surface of the tarsus, are conveniently included in this layer.

The actions of the interossei of the foot (Fig. 3.44), as of the hand, are indicated by the formula PAD and DAB: the plantar adduct and the dorsal abduct, but with the important difference that the longitudinal axis of the foot has shifted preaxially, and lies along the second metatarsal bone and the phalanges of the second toe. As in the hand, a plantar interosseous arises from the metatarsal bone of its own toe, a dorsal interosseous arises by two heads from the two metatarsals between which it lies. By use of the formula PAD and DAB the attachments of the interossei may be inferred if memory fails.

The three plantar adducting muscles adduct towards the second toe. The first toe has its own adductor mechanism (oblique and transverse heads of adductor hallucis) so that only the lateral three toes require adducting interossei. The first, second and third plantar interossei, each arising from the metatarsal bone of its own digit with some fibers attached to adjacent tarsometatarsal ligaments, are inserted by tendons into the medial (tibial or preaxial) sides of the third, fourth and fifth digits. The three tendons pass dorsal to the deep transverse ligament of the metatarsal heads and are inserted chiefly into the bases of the proximal phalanges, though each possesses an additional attachment into the dorsal extensor expansion.

The four dorsal abducting muscles abduct away from the line of the second toe. The big and little toes each possess an abductor muscle. The second requires an abducting muscle on each side while the third and fourth require a single muscle each to abduct the digit laterally, away from the second toe. Each arises from both bones of its own intermetatarsal space and from adjacent tarsometatarsal ligaments. The first is inserted on the big toe side of the second toe, the second, third and fourth on the little toe side of the second, third and fourth toes. The tendons are inserted chiefly into the bones of the proximal phalanges, though each gives an extension also to the dorsal extensor expansion.

The interossei, both plantar and dorsal, are crowded into the intermetatarsal spaces. The first space has the first dorsal interosseous muscle only. The other three spaces contain both dorsal and plantar interossei but in each of them the dorsal is the bulkier muscle, arising from both bones of the space. Note that a view from the plantar aspect of the sole displays as much dorsal as plantar interosseous muscle (Fig. 3.44), but on the dorsum only dorsal interossei are seen (as in the hand).

**Nerve supplies.** All interossei are supplied by the lateral plantar nerve (S2, 3). Those of the fourth space are supplied by the superficial branch, all the remainder by the deep branch.

**Action.** The adducting and abducting actions of the interossei (described above) are of little significance in the human foot. It is more important that, like their companions in the hand, they assist the lumbricals in extending the interphalangeal joints (through the extensor expansions) and flexing the metatarsophalangeal joints (by their attachments to the proximal phalanges).

The tendon of peroneus longus crosses the sole obliquely (Fig. 3.44). It lies against the posterior ridge, not deeply in the groove, of the cuboid and its bearing surface is protected at the lateral margin of the foot by a sesamoid fibrocartilage which may be ossified. As it crosses the groove of the cuboid it is held in position by the long plantar ligament which is firmly attached to the anterior and posterior ridges to bridge the groove (Fig. 3.48). Emerging from this tunnel the tendon proceeds to its insertion at the base of the first metatarsal and adjoining area on the lateral surface of the medial cuneiform (Fig. 3.44).

The tendon of tibialis posterior passes forward from the medial malleolus, above the sustentaculum tali, to be inserted into the tuberosity of the navicular. From here it sends expansions to the cuboid, to all three cuneiforms and to the bases of the second, third and fourth metatarsals (Fig. 3.44).

The posterior tibial artery and tibial nerve divide, each into medial and lateral plantar branches, under cover of the flexor retinaculum, the artery higher than the nerve, so that on medial and lateral borders of the sole the artery is more marginal than the nerve. Where they cross, the nerve is nearer the skin; and each artery is accompanied by a pair of venae comitantes. The medial plantar nerve is larger than the lateral; it supplies fewer muscles (though their bulk is considerable) than the lateral plantar nerve but it supplies much more skin. The medial plantar artery, on the other hand, is smaller than its fellow; it gives rise to no plantar arch. In the hand there are two palmar arches, a superficial from the ulnar artery, and a deep from the radial artery; but in the foot there is only one plantar arch, derived from the lateral plantar artery.

The medial plantar artery runs forward on the marginal (medial) side of the medial plantar nerve (Fig. 3.43) under cover of the muscles of the first layer. Both give off many branches to the sole, which perforate the plantar aponeurosis in the interval between abductor hallucis and flexor digitorum brevis. The artery supplies these two muscles and the structures on the medial side of the foot and its digital supply is restricted practically to the big toe.

The nerve supplies these two muscles, and also the flexor hallucis brevis and the first lumbrical; in addition it gives off digital cutaneous branches that supply the medial three and a half toes on their plantar surfaces and on their dorsal surfaces proximal to the nail beds. Its most lateral cutaneous branch communicates with the neighboring lateral plantar digital branch (Fig. 3.42) across the plantar surface of the fourth metatarsophalangeal joint, where pressure on the nerve may give rise to the painful condition known as metatarsalgia.

The lateral plantar artery crosses the sole obliquely, on the marginal (lateral) side of the nerve, just deep to the first layer of the sole, towards the base of the fifth metatarsal bone.

Both artery and nerve give off cutaneous branches to the sole that perforate the plantar aponeurosis in the interval between flexor digitorum brevis and abductor digiti minimi. The artery gives off a branch that accompanies the superficial branch of the nerve, but its main trunk accompanies the deep branch of the nerve to form the plantar arch. The plantar arch curves convexly forwards, across the bases of the fourth, third and second metatarsals and is joined in the proximal part of the first intermetatarsal space by the dorsalis pedis artery.

Perforating branches from the arcuate artery (from dorsalis pedis) join the arch in the proximal ends of the other three interosseous spaces. From the convexity of the plantar arch plantar metatarsal arteries run forwards and bifurcate to supply the four webs and digits. Anterior perforating arteries from the plantar metatarsal arteries reinforce the dorsal metatarsal arteries.

The veins accompanying the perforating arteries take most of the blood from the sole and from the interosseous muscles to the dorsal venous arch. The veins among the plantar muscles are now recognized as taking part in a sole pump which is a significant aid to the soleal pump of the posterior compartment of the calf (p. 193).

The lateral plantar nerve crosses the sole obliquely just deep to the first layer of muscles (Fig. 3.42). It supplies flexor accessorius and abductor digiti minimi and sends perforating branches through the plantar aponeurosis to supply skin on the lateral side of the sole. Near the base of the fifth metatarsal bone it divides into superficial and deep branches. The superficial branch supplies the fourth cleft and communicates with the medial plantar nerve and, by a lateral branch, supplies the skin of the lateral side and distal dorsum of the little toe. Unlike the superficial branch of the ulnar nerve, this branch supplies three muscles, namely flexor digiti minimi brevis and the two interossei of the fourth space (third plantar and fourth dorsal). The deep branch (Fig. 3.43) lies within the concavity of the plantar arch and ends by sinking into the deep surface of the oblique head of adductor hallucis. It gives off branches to the remaining interossei, to the transverse head of adductor hallucis and to the three lateral (bicipital) lumbricals. The branch to the second lumbrical passes dorsal to the transverse head of adductor hallucis and recurves ventrally to enter the lumbrical.

## Ankle Joint

The ankle joint, properly called the talocrural joint, is usually described as being of the hinge variety; but its movements are not quite those of a simple hinge, for the axis of rotation is not fixed but changes between the extremes of plantarflexion and dorsiflexion. The articulating surfaces are covered with hyaline cartilage. The weight-bearing surfaces are the upper facet of the talus and the inferior facet of the tibia. Stabilizing surfaces are those of the medial and lateral malleoli, which grip the sides of the talus. The joint is enclosed in a capsule lined with synovial membrane. The capsule is attached to the articular margins of all three bones except the anterior part of the talus, where it is fixed some distance in front of the articular margin, on the neck of the bone. Posteriorly the capsule, on its way up to the tibia, is attached also to the posterior tibiofibular ligament.

The synovial membrane is attached to the articular margin of the talus and clothes the intracapsular part of the neck. Elsewhere it is attached to all articular margins, as in any synovial joint. Occasionally the joint cavity extends up a little between tibia and fibula, into the inferior tibiofibular ligament.

Strong medial and lateral ligaments strengthen the joint. The deltoid ligament, on the medial side, is in two layers. The deep part (Fig. 3.45) is narrow, extending from the tibial malleolus to the side of the talus, inserted there into the concavity below the comma-shaped articular surface. Its shape is rectangular. Only the superficial part is triangular, like a delta. It fans downwards from the borders of the tibial malleolus and its lower margin has a continuous attachment from the medial tubercle of the talus (a weak band) along the edge of the sustentaculum tali and spring ligament (very strong) to the tuberosity of the navicular (a weak band) (Figs 3.45 and 3.48).

On the lateral side there are three separate bands, radiating from the lateral malleolus, which are collectively and commonly but not officially called the lateral ligament. Anterior and posterior bands pass to the talus, the intermediate band to the calcaneus. The anterior talofibular ligament (Fig. 3.46) joins the anterior border of the lateral malleolus to the neck of the talus. It is a flat band. The calcaneofibular ligament (Fig. 3.46) is a rounded cord extending from the front of the tip of the malleolus down and back to the lateral surface of the calcaneus. The strong posterior talofibular ligament (Fig. 3.45) lies horizontally between the malleolar fossa and the lateral tubercle of the talus. Above it lies the posterior tibiofibular ligament, whose lower part (sometimes called the inferior transverse ligament) articulates with the talus. In plantarflexion these two ligaments lie edge to edge.

The blood supply of the capsule and ligaments is derived from anterior and posterior tibial arteries and the peroneal artery, and the nerve supply is by the deep peroneal and tibial nerves.

**Figure 3.46** Left ankle from the lateral side.

## Movements

Examine a talus. Its upper facet, slightly concave from side to side, is convex anteroposteriorly. It is broad in front and narrow behind. The lateral facet, while gently concave from above downwards, is convex from front to back in most bones; it articulates with the lateral malleolus. The upper and medial surfaces of the talus are in contact with the tibia and its medial malleolus in all positions of the joint. The lateral malleolus adapts itself to the lateral surface of the talus; this involves rotary and lateral movements of the lower end of the fibula, which cause reciprocal movements at the upper end of the bone, in the superior tibiofibular synovial joint.

In full plantarflexion the smallest area of the talus is in contact with the tibia, but even in this position the amount of inversion and eversion possible at the ankle joint is very small indeed. For all practical purposes the ankle may be regarded as a true hinge joint. The axis of rotation is not horizontal, but slopes downwards and laterally. It passes through the lateral surface of the talus just below the apex of the articular triangle and through the medial surface at a higher level, just below the concavity of the comma-shaped articular area. It passes through the malleoli just above their apices. In truth, though the fact is of no practical application, the axis changes during movement, for the upper convexity of the talus is not the arc of a circle, but rather of an ellipse. The obliquity of the axis involves a slight movement resembling inversion in full plantarflexion, and the reverse, resembling slight eversion, in full dorsiflexion, but these apparent movements are not of true inversion and eversion (see below).

Plantarflexion (up to 50°) is produced most powerfully and essentially by gastrocnemius and soleus. This gives the basic thrust for propulsion (p. 211). The long flexor tendons and the long and short peronei all have a secondary action of flexion on the ankle joint. Dorsiflexion (extension, up to 25°) is produced by the tibialis anterior and peroneus tertius, aided on occasion by the toe extensors.

## Surgical Approach

The ankle joint can be exposed from the front between the tendons of extensor hallucis and digitorum longus, avoiding damage to the intervening deep peroneal nerve and anterior tibial vessels. For approach behind the medial malleolus the tendons of tibialis posterior and flexor digitorum longus are displaced forwards, while on the lateral side the peroneus longus and brevis can be displaced forwards to reach the capsule behind the lateral malleolus. For needle puncture the joint can be entered in front of the lateral malleolus and lateral to the tendon of peroneus tertius, or in front of the medial malleolus medial to tibialis anterior. The joint line should be defined by moving the foot.

## Tarsal Joints

Examine the articulated bones of a foot, preferably together with a separate talus, calcaneus and navicular. On the under surface of the talus there are two separate joints. At the back is the talocalcanean joint, where the convex posterior articular facet on the upper surface of the calcaneus (Fig. 3.49) articulates with the concave articular facet on the under surface of the talus. In front of this is a more complicated joint, with part of the under surface of the head of the talus articulating with the upper surface of the sustentaculum tali and body of the calcaneus and the spring ligament (Fig. 3.49), and the front of the head of the talus articulating with the navicular (Fig. 3.47). The whole joint with its single synovial cavity is called talocalcaneonavicular and, because of the way the bones articulate, it can be said to have two parts: talocalcanean and talonavicular. It is the talocalcanean part of the talocalcaneonavicular joint that forms the second joint underneath the talus.

**Figure 3.47** Bones of the left foot from above, separated at the midtarsal joint. The insertions of all tendons producing inversion and eversion of the foot are in front of this joint.

The calcaneocuboid joint is a separate joint between the front of the calcaneus and the back of the cuboid; this and the talonavicular part of the talocalcaneonavicular joint form what is usually called the midtarsal joint (Fig. 3.47).

There is an unfortunate complication in the use of the adjective subtalar to describe one or more joints beneath the talus. Anatomically, subtalar joint is an alternative name for the talocalcanean joint (the single one at the back of the calcaneus), but orthopedic surgeons often use subtalar joint as a functional term to include both the talocalcanean joint and the talocalcanean part of the talocalcaneonavicular joint, i.e. it is a composite term for the two joints beneath the talus, and is where most of the movements of inversion and eversion occur. It is essential to appreciate that while the lateral part of the midtarsal joint (the calcaneocuboid) is a separate joint with its own capsule, the medial part of the midtarsal joint (the talonavicular part of the talocalcaneonavicular) is not a separate joint but is only the anterior part of a continuous synovial cavity that extends backwards below the head of the talus, and includes the spring ligament, the anterior part of the upper surface of the calcaneus, and the sustentaculum tali. The head of the talus, in other words, is a ball which articulates with a socket composed of the posterior concavity of the navicular (part of the midtarsal joint) and the spring ligament and sustentaculum tali (part of the clinical subtalar joint).

The calcaneocuboid joint is a synovial joint whose surfaces are gently undulating. It is surrounded by a simple capsule, thickened above and below. Accessory ligaments on its plantar surfaces are the long and short plantar ligaments, and the lateral limb of the bifurcate ligament strengthens it medially. Simple gliding movement takes place during inversion and eversion of the foot.

The short plantar ligament (properly called the plantar calcaneocuboid) is a thick bundle which fills in the adjacent hollows in front of the anterior tubercle of the calcaneus and behind the posterior ridge of the cuboid (Fig. 3.48). It is covered over by the long plantar ligament.

The long plantar ligament covers the plantar surface of the calcaneus (Fig. 3.48). It extends from the posterior tubercles (i.e. medial and lateral tubercles) on the calcaneus to the anterior tubercle of that bone. Thence it covers the short plantar ligament, and its deeper fibers are attached to the posterior ridge of the cuboid. Its superficial fibers bridge the groove of the cuboid, making a fibrous roof over the peroneus longus tendon, and are attached to the anterior ridge of the cuboid and extend forwards to the bases of the central three metatarsal bones. It is covered by flexor accessorius, and its posterior part is visible in the gap between the medial fleshy and lateral tendinous heads of that muscle.

**Figure 3.48** Plantar ligaments of the left foot. On the medial side the deltoid ligament of the ankle joint fuses with the spring ligament.

Various other smaller but stronger interosseous plantar ligaments unite adjacent bones and help to support the arches of the foot.

The talocalcaneonavicular joint is a synovial joint of the ball and socket variety. The ball is the head of the talus (Fig. 3.47) and the socket comprises the two bones and two ligaments (Fig. 3.49). The bones are the navicular and calcaneus. The posterior surface of the navicular has an articular surface which is concave reciprocally with the anterior convexity of the head of the talus.

The anterior end of the upper surface of the calcaneus has a concave facet, and the sustentaculum tali a similar one (the two are often fused into a single concavity) for articulation with the inferior convexity of the head of the talus. On the head of the talus, between its navicular and calcanean surfaces, lies cartilage that articulates with neither bone. Here the talus articulates with the spring ligament medially and the calcaneonavicular limb of the bifurcate ligament laterally. All these structures are enclosed in a single capsule. One end of the capsular sleeve is attached to the neck of the talus around the articular margin on the head. The other end of the sleeve is attached along the upper surface of the navicular, the medial edge of the spring ligament, the posterior limits of the articular facets on sustentaculum tali and body of calcaneus, the medial limb of the bifurcate ligament and so back to the upper surface of the navicular. The socket of the joint is closed below by the spring and bifurcate ligaments. Between the two lies a pad of fat, covered with synovial membrane, that acts as a swab to spread synovial fluid on the moving head of the talus (like the Haversian fat pad in the acetabulum).

**Figure 3.49** Joints beneath the right talus exposed by removal of the talus.

The bifurcate ligament arises from the upper surface of the calcaneus just behind the anterior margin of that bone, under cover of the extensor digitorum brevis muscle at the front of the tarsal sinus. From the single origin two limbs diverge slightly from each other. The medial limb is attached to the navicular, near the inferolateral part of its articular margin. It forms part of the socket in which the head of the talus lies and gives attachment to the capsule of the talocalcaneonavicular joint. It is always present. The lateral limb of the bifurcate ligament is often absent. It is extracapsular, and is attached to the upper surface of the cuboid, being no more than a thickening of the capsule of the calcaneocuboid joint.

The plantar calcaneonavicular (spring) ligament is a very strong band that joins the whole thickness of the edge of the sustentaculum tali to the navicular between its tuberosity and the articular margin (Fig. 3.48). Its upper surface, which extends to the articular margins of both bones, articulates with the anteroinferior part of the head of the talus, and bears a plaque of fibrocartilage for this purpose. Its lower fibers extend well under the sustentaculum tali and lie almost transversely across the foot (Fig. 3.49). It consists, like ligaments in general, of collagenous tissue and despite its common name spring ligament it is not elastic.

The talocalcanean joint lies behind the talocalcaneonavicular joint. It is a synovial joint, oval in shape, with its long axis lying obliquely from posteromedial to anterolateral. The under surface of the talus is concave from side to side, reciprocally with the convex articular facet on the calcaneus (Fig. 3.62). The capsule and synovial membrane are attached to the articular margin.

The tarsal sinus lies obliquely between the talocalcaneonavicular joint and the talocalcanean joint. It is a cylindrical canal formed by the semicylindrical grooves between the articular surfaces on the two bones (Fig. 3.62), and it opens out at its lateral end like the broad end of a funnel. (Sometimes the medial tunnel-like part is called the tarsal canal, but this is not official nomenclature). Anteriorly and posteriorly the sinus is occupied by strong, flat bands, forming the interosseous talocalcanean ligament, whose fibers diverge upwards from each other in V-shaped manner. They are in reality thickenings of the adjacent joint capsules. They leave smooth marks on each bone alongside the articular facets. The central portion of each bony gutter is perforated by vascular foramina.

## Inversion and Eversion of the Foot

After the midtarsal and subtalar joints have been studied, the movements of inversion and eversion which they allow can be appreciated. The ability to invert and evert the foot confers on man a corresponding ability to walk across uneven surfaces that slope sideways, and loss of this power produces an appreciable disability when progressing across rough ground. A similar disability is noted in walking on smooth surfaces if these slope sideways, for such progression requires the upper foot to be everted and the lower inverted. Moreover, in turning at speed the movements are essential, in order to lean sideways on a foot whose sole is flat on the ground.

Mostly these inversion-eversion movements are performed on a foot anchored to the ground, with the leg bones and thus the whole body inverting and everting above it. It is difficult to analyze the movements from a fixed foot, so the analysis is best made with the foot free of the ground. The malleoli lock the talus, and the suspended foot inverts and everts around it. (Inversion is sometimes described as a combination of adduction and supination, eversion combining abduction with pronation, but authorities disagree about the definitions of these terms as applied to the foot.)

The movement of inversion (raising the medial border of the foot) is produced, self-evidently, by any muscle that is attached to the medial side of the foot. Tibialis anterior and tibialis posterior are responsible, assisted by extensor and flexor hallucis longus on occasion. Tibialis anterior dorsiflexes and tibialis posterior plantarflexes the foot at the ankle joint and these opposite effects cancel each other out when the two muscles combine to produce an uncomplicated inversion of the foot.

The movement of eversion (raising the lateral border of the foot) is produced, self-evidently, by any muscle that is attached to, or pulls upwards upon, the lateral side of the foot. Peroneus longus, brevis, and tertius are responsible. The former two, whose tendons pass behind the lateral malleolus, are plantarflexors, the last is a dorsiflexor, of the ankle joint. These opposite effects cancel each other out when the three muscles combine to produce a simple eversion of the foot.

All the muscles producing inversion and eversion are attached to the fore part of the foot, anterior to the midtarsal joint (Fig. 3.47). It is therefore evident that in both inversion and eversion the beginning of the movement must occur wholly at the midtarsal joint, and that only when the bones of this joint are fully wound up by tension of their ligaments is the rotatory force transmitted, passively by ligaments, to the subtalar joints. In fact, relatively little movement is possible at the midtarsal joint, and most of the full range of inversion and eversion occurs at the joints beneath the talus.

The calcaneus and cuboid are firmly connected by the long and short plantar ligaments, which limit the range of mobility at the midtarsal joint; when they and the spring ligament of the midtarsal joint are taut they transmit the rotatory force to the calcaneus. This bone then rotates (i.e. inverts or everts) under the talus, which is firmly wedged against the tibia between the malleoli and cannot therefore be inverted or everted.

The axis of inversion-eversion movement is along an oblique line (Fig. 3.50) passing from the lateral tubercle of the calcaneus upwards, forwards and medially through the neck of the talus, bisecting the medial part of the tarsal sinus. The lines of pull of the muscles lie at right angles to this obliquity, so that the muscles act to the best mechanical advantage. The balanced actions of these muscles combine in different patterns to produce ordered movements of the ankle and tarsal joints.

**Figure 3.50** Left foot from the medial side, with the axis of inversion and eversion indicated by the interrupted arrow. The inverting tendons pull at right angles around the axis. The everting peroneal tendons act in a similar way on the lateral side (Fig. 3.37).

(1) Tibialis anterior, which inverts (and therefore adducts) the foot at the tarsal joints and dorsiflexes the foot at the ankle joint.
(2) Peroneus tertius, which everts (and therefore abducts) the foot at the tarsal joints and dorsiflexes the foot at the ankle joint.
(3) Tibialis posterior, which inverts (and therefore adducts) the foot at the tarsal joints and plantarflexes the foot at the ankle joint.
(4) Peroneus longus and brevis, which evert (and therefore abduct) the foot at the tarsal joints and plantarflex the foot at the ankle joint.

These four combine in groups of two to produce their common movement and cancel out their opposing movements. Thus result dorsiflexion (1 and 2), inversion (1 and 3), eversion (2 and 4) and plantarflexion (3 and 4) of the foot as a whole, though it must be remembered that there is an added powerful mechanism (antigravity and propulsive) producing plantarflexion of the foot as a whole, namely the pull on the heel by soleus and gastrocnemius through the tendo calcaneus.

## Tarsometatarsal Joints

The osteology of the tarsal bones and the anatomy of the tarsometatarsal joints are considered in the account of the osteology of the foot (pp. 229 and 233).

The metatarsus is much more rigid than the metacarpus. The first tarsometatarsal joint possesses its own capsule and synovial membrane and is capable of some movement in a vertical plane to conform with movements in the medial longitudinal arch of the foot, and it becomes hyperextended in flat foot; but the joint movements in no way compare with those of the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb and no opposition of the big toe is possible. The second tarsometatarsal joint is immobile, the base of the metatarsal being firmly fixed between the anterior ends of the medial and lateral cuneiforms. This is a result of the shifting of the axis of the foot towards its medial side, and the second toe forms the line for adduction and abduction of the digits. The immobility of the second metatarsal and the slenderness of its shaft are contributory factors in spontaneous fracture ("march fracture") of this bone.

The first metatarsophalangeal joint is the site of hallux valgus. The big toe has no dorsal extensor expansion nor fibrous flexor sheath; its long tendons are held in position by strands of deep fascia. If the phalanges become displaced laterally and the fibrous bands give way, the pull of extensor hallucis longus, like that of extensor hallucis brevis, becomes oblique to the long axis of the toe and tends to increase the deformity.

## Arches of the Foot

Examine the bones of an accurately articulated foot, a lateral radiograph of the foot and the imprint of a wet foot on the bathroom floor. The heel, lateral margin of the foot, the ball of the foot (the part underneath the metatarsal heads) and the pads of the distal phalanges touch the ground. The medial margin of the foot arches up between the heel and the ball of the big toe, forming a visible and obvious medial longitudinal arch. The lateral margin of the foot is in contact with the ground, but its constituent bones do not bear with equal pressure on the ground. As on the medial side, so on the lateral side, there is a bony longitudinal arch extending from the heel to the heads of the metatarsal bones, but the lateral longitudinal arch is much flatter than the medial.

The constituent bones of the arches can be seen in the articulated foot. The medial longitudinal arch consists of calcaneus, talus, navicular, the three cuneiform bones and their three metatarsal bones. The pillars of the arch are the tuberosity of the calcaneus posteriorly and the heads of the medial three metatarsal bones anteriorly. The lateral longitudinal arch consists of calcaneus, cuboid and the lateral two metatarsal bones.

The transverse arch is, in reality, only half an arch, being completed as an arch by that of the other foot. It consists of the bases of the five metatarsal bones and the adjacent cuboid and cuneiforms. The heads of the five metatarsal bones lie flat upon the ground and can scarcely be described as taking part in the transverse arch, though the first and fifth heads bear more weight than the others.

The factors maintaining the integrity of the arches of the foot are identical with those responsible in any joint of the body, namely, bony, ligamentous and muscular, but their relative importance is different in the three arches.

## Medial Longitudinal Arch

No bony factor is responsible for maintaining the stability of this arch. The head of the talus is supported on the sustentaculum tali, but this is a negligible factor. Ligaments are important, but are inadequate alone to maintain the arch. The most important ligament is the plantar aponeurosis, stretching like a tie beam or bowstring between the supporting pillars of the arch. If it is shortened by extension of the toes, especially the big toe, it draws the pillars together and so heightens the arch. Next in importance is the spring ligament, for it supports the head of the talus. If it stretches it allows the navicular and calcaneus to separate and so the head of the talus, the highest point of the arch, sinks lower between them. All the interosseous ligaments, especially those which hold the talus and calcaneus together at their articulating surfaces, are of assistance in maintaining the arch.

Muscles are indispensable to the maintenance of the medial longitudinal arch, for if they are paralyzed, or weakened beyond a certain point, the ligaments alone are unable to maintain the arch.

Examine a living foot. The arch cannot be pressed flat; the ligaments are too strong. Static body weight will not flatten the arch; indeed the muscles are not in action when standing still. Consider the inertia of the body weight to be overcome at the take-off and the momentum to be absorbed in landing. In each of these the forces are vastly greater than the mere weight of the body. The arch now acts like a semielliptic spring. If the muscles are too weak the ligaments eventually stretch and flat foot results.

The most efficient means of maintaining an arch such as this is to tie its two pillars together. The most important muscular supporting structures are therefore those which run longitudinally beneath the arch. Overwhelmingly efficient in this respect is the tendon of flexor hallucis longus (Fig. 3.50). The muscle is the bulkiest of those beneath the soleus in the calf and from its powerful multipennate mass the tendon runs beneath the sustentaculum tali and thence passes straight forward, below the arch, to lie between the sesamoid bones on the metatarsal head before it reaches its insertion at the distal phalanx of the big toe. This is not only the bulkiest of the deep calf muscles, but it can spare a slip to assist the pull of its weaker sister, flexor digitorum longus, and it is highly significant that this slip acts only on the tendons to the second and third toes, the remaining members of the medial longitudinal arch.

Thus flexor hallucis longus acts as a bowstring along the medial longitudinal arch from the sustentaculum tali to the medial three digits. It is not called into play during short periods of standing, for generally the weight is borne well back on the heel and the pads of the toes are not pressed on the ground. Meanwhile the ligaments support the arch. But during prolonged standing the ligaments tire, and relief is obtained by pressing the pads of the toes to the ground. During movements of propulsion and during landing on the feet the inertia and momentum of the body weight throw a vastly greater strain on the arch, and this strain is taken up by the contraction of the flexor hallucis longus muscle and the tension of its tendon.

The short muscles in the first layer that are inserted into the medial three toes (abductor hallucis, and the medial half of flexor digitorum brevis) likewise assist in maintaining the arch. The attachment of some interosseous muscle fibers to ligaments in the region of the tarsometatarsal joints may help to stabilize these joints when rigidity is required.

The tendons of tibialis anterior and peroneus longus are inserted into the same two bones (medial cuneiform and first metatarsal bone) and they are often compared to a sling that supports the longitudinal arches of the foot, like a skipping rope pulled up beneath the instep of a shoe. But there is a significant difference – the tendons are not free like a skipping rope to slide under the foot, but are fixed to bone and they exert opposite effects upon the medial longitudinal arch. Tibialis anterior, by the upward pull of its tendon, may have some slight influence in maintaining the medial longitudinal arch, but the peroneus longus tendon has the reverse effect, as is so well seen in the everted flat foot of peroneal spasm in children. The lowest point in the tendon is at its sesamoid fibrocartilage, where it bears on the cuboid; from this point it rises further from the ground as it slopes across to its insertion. Its pull tends to evert and abduct the foot and lower the medial side of the foot.

Tibialis anterior and tibialis posterior have a significant influence on the arch, but mechanically different from the bowstring effect of the longitudinally directed muscles and tendons in the sole. They act by their tendency to invert and adduct the foot, in other words to raise the medial border from the ground, and have no direct pull tending to approximate the pillars of the arch, and are consequently less important factors in maintaining its integrity.

## Lateral Longitudinal Arch

No bony factor contributes to the stability of this arch, but ligaments play a relatively more important part than in the case of the medial arch.

The plantar aponeurosis in its lateral part acts as a bowstring beneath the arch and the plantar ligaments are also significant. The short plantar ligament is very thick, filling the adjacent concavities of calcaneus and cuboid. The long plantar ligament, though a thinner layer, extends from the heel to both ridges of the cuboid and the metatarsal bases and helps to maintain the slight concavity of the lateral arch.

The peroneus longus tendon, tending to depress the medial longitudinal arch, at the same time pulls upwards on the lateral longitudinal arch and is the most important single factor in maintaining its integrity. The tendons of flexor digitorum longus to the fourth and fifth toes (assisted by flexor accessorius) and the muscles of the first layer of the sole (lateral half of flexor digitorum brevis and abductor digiti minimi) also assist strongly, by preventing separation of the pillars of the arch.

## Transverse Arch

The intermediate and lateral cuneiforms are wedge-shaped, and in this single respect the bones are adapted to the maintenance of the transverse arch of the foot. The lateral cuneiform overhangs the cuboid and thus rests on it to some extent. But the medial cuneiform is wedge-shaped the wrong way for an arch, and it is evident that bony factors in fact play but little part in maintaining the transverse arch. The lateral cuneiform bears on the cuboid from above, but not with much pressure because the medial longitudinal arch has its own supports.

The ligaments that bind together the cuneiforms and bases of the five metatarsal bones are much more important, and the most important factor of all is the tendon of peroneus longus, the pull of which tends to approximate medial and lateral borders of the foot across the sole. At the heads of the metatarsal bones a shallow arch is maintained by the deep transverse ligament of the metatarsal heads, by the transverse fibers that bind together the digital slips of the plantar aponeurosis and, perhaps, by the transverse head of the adductor hallucis muscle, but the last is a very slender band.

## Propulsive Mechanism of the Foot

If the foot were entirely rigid it would serve as a propulsive member by plantarflexion at the ankle joint and, indeed, the contraction of soleus and gastrocnemius is the chief factor responsible for propulsion in walking, running and jumping. But the propulsive action of these great muscles of the calf is enhanced by arching of the foot and flexion of the toes. The sequence of events in walking is usually described as four phases: heel-strike, support (stance or weight-bearing), toe-off (push off) and swing. The weight of the foot is taken successively on the heel, lateral border, and the ball of the foot, and the last part to leave the ground is the anterior pillar of the medial longitudinal arch and the medial three digits. In running the heel remains off the ground, but the take-off point is still the anterior pillar of the medial longitudinal arch.

While the heel is rising from the ground the medial toes are gradually extended. The extended big toe pulls the plantar aponeurosis around the first metatarsal head and so heightens the arch; at the same time it elongates the flexor hallucis longus and flexor digitorum longus muscles, and this increases the force of their subsequent contraction.

Contraction of the toe flexors, long and short, increases the force of the take-off by the pressure of the toes on the ground. Contraction of the long flexors also aids plantarflexion at the ankle joint.

**Figure 3.51** Phasic action of the pretibial muscle group during walking. The contraction during heel-strike (shock-absorbing) is much greater than that needed for toe clearance during the swing-through phase.

The most powerful muscle acting in this way is the flexor hallucis longus, which acts on the big toe through its tendon of insertion and on the second and third toes by the slip it gives to the flexor digitorum longus. The short flexor muscles of the sole strongly assist the long flexors in heightening the arch and in flexing the toes – the lumbricals prevent the toes from buckling under when pulled upon by flexor digitorum longus. The propulsive force so produced adds greatly to that of the soleus and gastrocnemius. The tendo calcaneus plantarflexes a very mobile, not a rigid, foot. If the tendo calcaneus is activated by a bottom gear and top gear mechanism (soleus and gastrocnemius), the flexors of the tarsus and toes provide an overdrive.

## Shock-Absorbing Mechanism of the Foot

When landing at speed, as for example from a height, the toes and then the forefoot take the first thrust of the weight before the heel strikes the ground. It is, in fact, the reverse time sequence of taking off at maximum speed. But even in quiet walking, with heel and toe sequence, muscles play an essential part in absorbing the shock of landing. At the moment of heel strike the pretibial group, notably tibialis anterior, contract as they elongate to lower the forefoot more gently to the ground (Fig. 3.51).

## Cutaneous Innervation

The skin of the buttock receives fibers that run down from the subcostal and iliohypogastric nerves, the posterior rami of the first three lumbar and first three sacral nerves, and the perforating cutaneous nerve, with an upward contribution from the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve. The latter supplies a long strip down the back of the limb to below the popliteal fossa, with lateral and medial femoral cutaneous nerves on either side and a contribution of variable extent from the obturator nerve on the medial side. On the front of the thigh, the ilioinguinal nerve extends below the inguinal ligament, with subcostal and genitofemoral elements on either side, and the intermediate femoral cutaneous nerve down the middle overlapping with its medial and lateral namesakes and the obturator.

**Figure 3.52** Cutaneous nerves of the front of the right lower limb.

The skin of the front of the knee receives branches from the medial femoral cutaneous nerve, the lateral cutaneous nerve of the calf which extends some way down the outside and back of the leg, and medially the saphenous nerve which reaches as far as the metatarsophalangeal joint of the great toe. The superficial peroneal extends over the front of the lower leg and dorsum of the foot, with the deep peroneal supplying the first toe cleft. The sural nerve takes over from the lateral cutaneous nerve of the calf on the lateral side of the back of the leg and extends along the lateral side of the foot to the little toe. Calcanean branches of the tibial nerve supply the heel, with medial and lateral plantar nerves on the sole in front of the tibial area of supply; the medial plantar, like the median nerve in the hand, usually supplies three and a half digits.

**Figure 3.53** Cutaneous nerves of the back of the right lower limb.

The segmental innervation of lower limb muscles has been considered on page 25. In the thigh the anterior compartment is supplied by the femoral nerve and the adductor group by the obturator nerve. The tibial part of the sciatic nerve is the nerve of the posterior compartment, with only the short head of biceps supplied by the common peroneal part. In the gluteal region, the inferior gluteal nerve innervates gluteus maximus with the other two glutei receiving their supply from the superior gluteal which also supplies tensor fasciae latae. The short lateral rotator muscles behind the hip have their own nerves, with the obturator externus supplied by the obturator nerve which also supplies part of adductor magnus (hence it has a double innervation with the sciatic). The tibial nerve is the nerve of the flexor compartment of the leg and its plantar branches supply the muscles of the sole. The common peroneal nerve divides into the superficial peroneal for the peroneal compartment and the deep peroneal for the anterior or extensor compartment.

## Sympathetic Innervation

As with the brachial plexus, a gray ramus communicans joins each nerve root of the lumbar and sacral plexuses to the appropriate ganglion of the sympathetic trunk so that postganglionic fibers can be distributed to each nerve. The preganglionic fibers for the lower limb have come from cell bodies in the lateral horn of spinal cord segments T11-L2, for the ultimate supply of blood vessels and (as far as skin is concerned) sweat glands and arrectores pilorum muscles.

Summaries of these plexuses, including all the lower limb branches, begin on page 414, after the abdomen and pelvis have been described.

## Peripheral Nerve Injuries

Peripheral nerve injuries are much less common in the lower limb than in the upper; although damage to a whole brachial plexus can occur, this is most unusual in the case of the lumbar and sacral plexuses. The commonest injury is to the common peroneal nerve, and the main features of this and other nerve lesions are summarized below, together with notes on the more common exposures if exploration and repair are required.

Since the nerve breaks up into a sheaf of branches as soon as it enters the thigh (p. 156), it is more subject to damage by penetrating injuries of the lower abdomen than of the limb. Pelvic masses such as a hematoma or neoplasm may affect it, and it has been known to be damaged by catheterization of the femoral artery. In a complete lesion, extension of the knee by the quadriceps will be lost, with some weakness of hip flexion. There is anesthesia over the front of the thigh; with lesions that cause pain in the nerve the pain may extend as far as the medial side of the foot (saphenous branch). Test for the action of rectus femoris (p. 157).

## Lateral Femoral Cutaneous Nerve

The nerve may be compressed as it passes from abdomen to thigh (p. 146) or by direct pressure below and medial to the anterior superior iliac spine, producing meralgia paresthetica which is recognized by paresthesia in the upper lateral part of the thigh. If necessary the nerve may have to be freed from the iliac fascia and inguinal ligament.

## Obturator Nerve

Because of its deep position, trauma to this nerve is extremely rare, but it may be damaged by obstetric procedures or involved in pelvic disease, e.g. an ovarian tumor may cause pain in the skin on the medial side of the thigh (p. 146). In obturator paralysis the loss of adduction at the hip is not noticed during walking but when sitting the affected limb cannot be crossed over the other.

## Sciatic Nerve

The commonest cause of damage is (regrettably) by misplaced gluteal injections (p. 166). Other causes include pelvic disease and severe trauma to the hip (in 7% of dislocations and 16% of fracture-dislocations). There is paralysis of the hamstrings and all the muscles of the leg and foot (supplied by the tibial and common peroneal nerves). Paralysis of the hamstrings may be difficult to test because of pain but foot drop will be obvious, and there will be anesthesia below the knee but not on the medial side of the leg due to the supply here from the saphenous branch of the femoral nerve. There will only be anesthesia on the back of the thigh if the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve is damaged at the same time; the sciatic nerve through its two main branches only supplies skin below knee level. Test for plantarflexion and dorsiflexion.

**Surgical approach.** The sciatic nerve is explored by exposure at the lower border of gluteus maximus and medial to the long head of biceps; from there it can be followed upwards or downwards.

## Common Peroneal Nerve

Direct trauma or pressure by plaster casts at the neck of the fibula (p. 173) make this the most commonly damaged nerve in the lower limb. Foot drop is the most obvious sign, due to paralysis of the extensor muscles supplied by the deep peroneal branch (p. 188). This results in a high-stepping gait to ensure that the toes do not scrape along the ground. Peroneus longus and brevis in the lateral compartment will also be affected, being supplied by the superficial peroneal branch. Anesthesia in a common peroneal nerve lesion extends over the lower lateral part of the leg and the dorsum of the foot (p. 189), but as with radial nerve lesions in the upper limb there may be little or no sensory loss. Test for dorsiflexion.

**Surgical approach.** The nerve can be exposed by following it down from behind the biceps tendon on the lateral side of the popliteal fossa.

## Tibial Nerve

Damage to this nerve is uncommon. The main effect is paralysis of the calf muscles. Test for standing on tiptoe.

**Surgical approach.** The nerve is easily exposed in the popliteal fossa; it can be followed lower down by splitting gastrocnemius and soleus vertically in the midline.

## Saphenous Nerve

The lower part of this nerve, in front of the medial malleolus (p. 185), is subject to damage during varicose vein surgery by becoming included in ligatures — a cause of possible litigation.

## Hip Bone

This is formed of three bones, which fuse in a Y-shaped epiphysis involving the acetabulum. The pubis and ischium together form an incomplete bony wall for the pelvic cavity; their outer surfaces give attachment to thigh muscles. The ilium forms the pelvic brim between the hip joint and the joint with the sacrum; above the pelvic brim it is prolonged, broad and wing-like, for the attachment of ligaments and large muscles. The anterior two-thirds of the projecting ilium, thin bone, forms the iliac fossa, part of the posterior abdominal wall. The posterior one-third, thick bone, carries the auricular surface for the sacrum and, behind this, is prolonged for strong sacroiliac ligaments which bear the body weight. The outer surface of the ilium gives attachment to buttock muscles. The ischium and pubis together lie in approximately the same plane; the plane of the ilium is at nearly a right angle with this.

Note the correct anatomical position of the bone. The pubic tubercle and anterior superior iliac spine lie in the same vertical plane, and the upper border of the symphysis pubis and the ischial spine lie in the same horizontal plane.

## Lateral Surface of the Hip Bone

This (Fig. 3.54) is best studied after the anatomy of the thigh and buttock is familiar.

The hip joint socket, the acetabulum (vinegar-cup), is a concave hemisphere whose axis is not strictly horizontal but is directed also downwards and slightly backwards along the axis of the femoral neck. Its inferior margin is lacking (Fig. 3.54), so the vinegar would run out of the cup. The margins of this acetabular notch, curved in outline, are lined with hyaline cartilage, which continues as a wide band inside the concave surface of the acetabulum. It is widest above, opposite the notch. This wide upper part of the articular surface is the weight-bearing area, lying like a cap over the femoral head (remember the anatomical position, Fig. 5.50, p. 373). The articular surface does not quite reach the rim of the acetabulum, nor does it floor in the whole concavity. The non-articular bone in the acetabular fossa is paper-thin and translucent. This bone is prolonged down below the acetabular notch as a narrow rim skirting the obturator foramen. Here pubis and ischium meet at the low rounded elevation about a third of the way down the anterior margin of the greater sciatic notch (see below). Pubis and ilium meet at the anterior pole of the acetabulum (the place is indicated by the iliopubic eminence). Ilium and ischium meet just above the posterior pole of the acetabulum. Thus the broad weight-bearing part of the articular surface is carried entirely by the ilium.

The acetabular notch is filled by the transverse ligament, thus completing the concavity of the articular surface (Fig. 3.17). Beyond the articular margin the rim of the acetabulum gives attachment to the fibrocartilagenous acetabular labrum. The capsule of the hip joint is attached to the acetabular labrum and to the surrounding bone; inferiorly it is attached to the transverse ligament. The ligament of the femoral head (ligamentum teres) is attached to the transverse ligament, not to the bone of the acetabulum. Synovial membrane is attached to the concave inner margin of the articular surface, whence it covers the Haversian fat pad in the acetabular fossa and is continued along the ligamentum teres to the fovea on the femoral head.

Synovial membrane is likewise attached around the convexity of the articular margin and to the outer margin of the transverse ligament, whence it lines the hip-joint capsule down to the femur.

The outer surface of the ilium, above the acetabulum, rises wedge-shaped along an anterior border to the anterior superior iliac spine. Behind the acetabulum it passes up as a thick bar of weight-bearing bone, curves back to form the greater sciatic notch, and continues to a posterior margin that lies between posterior inferior and posterior superior iliac spines. The upper border of the ilium, the iliac crest (see below), between anterior and posterior superior spines, has a bold upward convexity and is at the same time curved from front to back in a sinuous bend. The anterior part of the crest is curved outwards, and the external lip is built up into a more prominent convexity 5 cm behind the anterior superior spine; this is the tubercle of the iliac crest and forms the most lateral part of the bony pelvis, but not the highest part which is 7.5 cm (3 in) behind the tubercle. The line between the highest points of the two iliac crests indicates the supracristal plane, and passes through the spine of L4 vertebra, the landmark for counting vertebral spines (e.g. for lumbar puncture, p. 575).

The gluteal surface of the ilium is undulating, convex in front and concave behind, in conformity with the curvature of the iliac crest. It shows three curved gluteal lines. The most prominent is the posterior gluteal line, a low crest passing down from the iliac crest to the front of the posterior inferior spine. The area behind this line gives attachment to part of gluteus maximus. The middle gluteal line is a series of low tubercles coming from the iliac crest 2 cm behind the anterior superior spine; it is convex upwards, curving back just below the tubercle of the iliac crest and then downwards towards the greater sciatic notch. Gluteus medius arises from the ilium between this and the posterior gluteal line, up to the outer lip of the iliac crest. The inferior gluteal line is less prominent. It curves from below the anterior superior spine towards the apex of the greater sciatic notch. Tensor fasciae latae arises from the gluteal surface just below the iliac crest, between anterior superior spine and tubercle. Below this the area between the middle and inferior gluteal lines is occupied by the attachment of gluteus minimus. Below the inferior gluteal line is an area of multiple vascular foramina, then a narrow non-perforated strip along the upper margin of the acetabulum for the reflected head of rectus femoris (Fig. 3.17).

The fusion of ilium and ischium is marked by a rounded elevation between the acetabulum and the greater sciatic notch. Above this the ilium forms the major part of the notch. Piriformis emerges here, almost filling the notch and arising in part slightly from its upper margin.

The anterior border of the ilium shows a gentle S-bend. Its upper narrow part gives attachment to sartorius, at the anterior superior spine and for a finger's breadth below this. The lower half of this border is projected into the anterior inferior iliac spine. This shows a prominent oval facet for the straight head of rectus femoris. Below the facet is a smoother area for the iliofemoral ligament, which is attached also somewhat behind this, above the acetabular margin (Fig. 3.13).

The posterior border of the ilium is a rounded bar of bone between the posterior superior and posterior inferior spines (Fig. 6.82, p. 553). It gives attachment to the sacrotuberous ligament. The posterior superior iliac spine makes a characteristic dimple in the skin of the buttock at the level of the second piece of the sacrum.

The posterior part of the iliac crest is thicker than the rest. Running forward from the posterior superior spine is a ridge which is traceable into the external lip at the upper end of the posterior gluteal line. External to the ridge the bevelled surface of the iliac crest continues down to the gluteal surface behind the posterior gluteal line. Gluteus maximus arises from the whole of this area.

In the articulated pelvis the ridge along the posterior part of the iliac crest is seen to be in line, below the posterior superior iliac spine, with the transverse tubercles of the lowest three sacral vertebrae (Fig. 6.82, p. 553). Along the ridge and these transverse tubercles the posterior lamella of the lumbar fascia is attached. The aponeurotic origin of latissimus dorsi is fused with the posterior lamella along the ridge, but the muscle itself extends forward of this along the external lip of the iliac crest, nearly halfway to the anterior superior spine (Fig. 2.5, p. 58). Internal to the ridge and its attached posterior lamella of lumbar fascia the iliocostalis part of erector spinae arises along a visible strip of non-perforated bone. Between this strip and the auricular surface the convex face of the bone shows lines of massed tubercles for the attachment of the strong sacroiliac ligaments (Fig. 3.55).

At the lateral margin of iliocostalis the strong iliolumbar ligament is attached to the iliac crest. Quadratus lumborum arises from the iliolumbar ligament and extends lateral to this to arise in continuity from a visible smooth strip that extends to a point one-third of the way forward from the posterior superior spine. This point is commonly marked by a low tubercle, for the attachment of the conjoined layers of the lumbar fascia that enclose quadratus lumborum (p. 358). In the anatomical position of the bone this is the highest part of the iliac crest. From here the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles are attached side by side. The internal oblique is attached along the center of the crest, the transversus to the inner lip of the crest, both extending to the anterior superior spine. External oblique is attached to the outer lip of the iliac crest in its anterior half; the gap between it and latissimus dorsi forms the base of the lumbar triangle (p. 296). The inguinal ligament, attached to the anterior superior spine, extends across to the pubic tubercle. The fascia lata of the thigh is attached along the whole length of the external lip of the iliac crest, splitting to enclose the narrow origin of tensor fasciae latae, and splitting also around gluteus maximus, where its deep layer is attached to the posterior gluteal line.

The body of the pubis, quadrilateral in shape, is projected laterally as a superior ramus which joins the ilium and ischium at the acetabulum and an inferior ramus which fuses with the ischium below the obturator foramen (Fig. 3.13). The symphyseal surface of the body is oval in shape; it is coated with a layer of hyaline cartilage for the secondary cartilaginous joint that constitutes the pubic symphysis (p. 414). The upper border of the body, gently convex, is the pubic crest. It is marked laterally by a forward-projecting prominence, the pubic tubercle. From the pubic tubercle two ridges diverge laterally into the superior ramus. The upper ridge, sharp, is the pectineal line; it forms part of the pelvic brim, and joins the arcuate line of the ilium. The lower ridge, more rounded, is the obturator crest. It passes downwards into the anterior margin of the acetabular notch, where it becomes very prominent. Between these ridges the surface of the superior ramus can be traced to its junction with the ilium. Here lies a rounded prominence, the iliopubic eminence, the site of the cartilaginous epiphysis between these parts of the hip bone. Below the obturator crest on the pubic ramus is the obliquely-placed obturator groove, which lodges the obturator nerve in contact with the bone. The obturator vessels lie below the nerve as the neurovascular bundle passes over the obturator membrane. Behind this groove a sharp border runs down to form the anterior margin of the obturator foramen. The inferior ramus of the pubis is marked by an everted crest. The line of junction with the ischial ramus sometimes shows as a low ridge; it is halfway between the ischial tuberosity and the pubic crest.

The pubic crest gives origin to rectus abdominis and, in front of this, pyramidalis. The narrow linea alba is attached to the fibrous tissue of the pubic symphysis, not to bone, but lateral to this the conjoint tendon is attached over these muscles to the front of the pubic crest, across to the pubic tubercle and, in continuity, along the sharp pectineal line for about 2 cm. This same extent of the pectineal line receives also the upper margin of the lacunar ligament. The periosteum of the pectineal line lateral to this is thickened by the pectineal ligament (of Cooper) (Fig. 5.10, p. 303). Pectineus arises deep to the lacunar ligament, from just below the pectineal line, between pubic tubercle and iliopubic eminence. The lateral prominence of the obturator crest, near the acetabular margin, gives attachment to the pubofemoral ligament. The pubic tubercle receives the attachment of the inguinal ligament and its so-called reflected part, which is really the posterior crus from the opposite side. The lateral crus of the superficial ring is attached with the inguinal ligament to the pubic tubercle. The medial crus, in front of the conjoint tendon, is inserted into the front of the pubic crest alongside the symphysis (Fig. 5.3, p. 297).

Like the pubis the ischium is an L-shaped bone, and the two lie in the same plane. An upper thick portion of the ischium, the body, joins with pubis and ilium at the acetabulum and extends down to the ischial tuberosity (see below); it supports the sitting weight. A lower, thinner bar, the inferior ramus, joins the inferior ramus of the pubis to enclose the obturator foramen.

Behind the acetabulum observe again the low elevation at the line of fusion of ischium and ilium. At the margin of the acetabulum, where the capsule of the hip joint is attached, the fibers of the ischiofemoral ligament sweep from this upper part of the ischium upwards to encircle the capsule around the neck of the femur as the zona orbicularis. More medially the upper part of the body of the ischium completes the lower part of the greater sciatic notch. Here the sciatic nerve, with the nerve to quadratus femoris deep to it, lies on the ischium. This site of emergence of the nerve into the buttock lies one-third of the way up from the ischial tuberosity to the posterior superior iliac spine.

The spine of the ischium projects medially to divide the greater from the lesser sciatic notch. The sacrospinous ligament is attached to its margins and tip, converting the greater sciatic notch into the greater sciatic foramen. The pudendal nerve lies on the ligament just medial to the spine. The internal pudendal vessels cross the tip, while the nerve to obturator internus lies on the base of the spine. The superior gemellus takes origin from the spine. The lesser sciatic notch lies between the spine and the ischial tuberosity (Figs 3.20 and 5.67, p. 405). It is bridged by the sacrotuberous ligament, which with the sacrospinous ligament converts the notch into the lesser sciatic foramen (Fig. 5.51, p. 374). Obturator internus emerges through this foramen into the buttock, and the internal pudendal vessels and nerve pass forward into the perineum. The lesser sciatic notch is floored in life by thickened periosteum, grooved by tendinous fibers on the deep surface of the muscle (Fig. 3.55), and lubricated by a bursa. The inferior gemellus arises from the upper margin of the ischial tuberosity, above the hamstrings (Fig. 3.54).

The ischial tuberosity is a rugged prominence whose convex posterior surface is divided transversely by a low ridge. An oval smooth area above this is divided by a vertical ridge into two areas, a lateral and a medial (Figs 3.20 and 3.54). Semimembranosus tendon is attached to the lateral area, semitendinosus and the long head of biceps to the medial area.

Between semimembranosus area and obturator foramen the lateral surface gives a vertical linear origin, 3 cm long, to quadratus femoris, which leaves no mark on the bone. Below the transverse ridge the ischial tuberosity shows a longitudinal crest; this supports the sitting body. The fascia lata of the thigh is attached to this ridge. The lateral bevelled surface here gives origin to the fibers of the hamstring part of adductor magnus (p. 159). The medial bevelled surface receives the sacrotuberous ligament. The ischial tuberosity curves forward from the rugged weight-bearing part into the slender inferior ramus. Adductor magnus has a continuous origin along this ramus up to the pubic part of the muscle.

The obturator foramen is ringed by the sharp margins of the pubis and ischium, those of the pubis overlapping each other in a spiral to form the obturator sulcus. The obturator membrane is attached to the margin of the foramen, but not to the obturator groove. Obturator externus arises from the outer surface of the membrane, a little of the ramus of the ischium and a good deal from the pubis (Fig. 3.13).

## Medial Surface of Hip Bone

This is best studied (Fig. 3.55) when the pelvic walls (p. 373) and perineum (p. 400) are understood. The pelvic brim is made by the top of the pubic crest and the pectineal line, continued up along the rounded border of the ilium (called the arcuate line) to the top of the auricular surface. This curved pelvic brim slopes up at 60°. Below the brim lies the pelvic cavity, above it is the iliac fossa in the abdominal cavity.

On the inner surface of the ilium the iliocostalis area and the lines of tubercles on the ligamentous area have already been examined during the study of the outer surface. The auricular area really is ear-shaped; it extends from the pelvic brim to the posterior inferior iliac spine. Its surface undulates gently from convex above to concave below and is roughened by numerous tubercles and depressions. It is covered with hyaline cartilage and forms an almost immobile synovial joint with the ala of the sacrum. The capsule and synovial membrane are attached to the articular margin. In later years fibrous bands often join the articular surfaces within the joint space.

The iliac fossa is a gentle concavity in the ala of the ilium in front of the sacroiliac joint and its ligaments. Its deepest part, high in the fossa, is composed of paper-thin translucent bone. Iliacus arises, up to the inner lip of the iliac crest, over the whole area down to the level of the anterior inferior iliac spine. The lower one-third of the fossa is bare bone, separated by a large bursa from the overlying iliacus. The fibers of iliacus converge to pass over a broad groove between the iliopubic eminence and the anterior inferior spine. The iliacus fascia is attached around the margins of the muscle: to the iliac crest, the arcuate line and iliopubic eminence (and to the inguinal ligament). Psoas major passes freely along the pelvic brim and crosses the eminence. The psoas bursa deep to it is the iliacus bursa already mentioned. The psoas fascia is attached to the arcuate line and the iliopubic eminence. Psoas minor, when present, has a tendon which flattens out to be inserted into the pelvic brim at the eminence.

The body and superior ramus of the inner surface of the pubis are bare bone, with no attachments. The abnormal obturator artery and/or vein cross behind the ramus and the obturator nerve lies in contact with the ramus in the obturator groove. Levator ani (pubococcygeus part) is attached to the junction of body and inferior ramus level with the lower border of the symphysis. Medial to this are the attachments of the puborectalis sling and the levator prostatae (pubovaginalis) muscle (Fig. 5.54, p. 376). More medially the puboprostatic (pubovesical in the female) ligaments are attached at this level. The inferior ramus thus lies in the perineum. Immediately below the symphyseal surface the subpubic ligament is attached; the deep dorsal vein of the penis (clitoris) lies in the midline below it. Extending down from the symphyseal surface is a ridge of bone to which the perineal membrane is attached. External to this is the everted margin already noted. Here the crus of the corpus cavernosum is attached, with the ischiocavernosus muscle. Between the perineal membrane and the obturator foramen the inferior ramus forms the wall of the anterior recess of the ischioanal fossa. Here the dorsal nerve and artery of the penis (clitoris) pass forwards below levator ani, and here the bone gives attachment to fibers of sphincter urethrae. At the margin of the obturator foramen the obturator internus muscle is attached (see below).

The inner surface of the body of the ischium is very gently concave. From its posterior border projects the prominent ischial spine. This divides the greater from the lesser sciatic notch. To it are attached the coccygeus muscle and the white line that gives attachment to the pelvic floor (levator ani, Fig. 5.52, p. 374). Between the ischial spine and tuberosity the lesser sciatic notch is grooved by the tendinous fibers on the deep surface of obturator internus. The grooves and ridges are made more prominent in the fresh bone by thickening of the periosteum. As the ischial tuberosity curves forwards into the ramus it is characterized by a falciform ridge. This ridge and the rough area below it receive the sacrotuberous ligament and its falciform process. Obturator internus arises from the body of the ischium and the area above it up to the arcuate line on the ilium (pelvic brim) to the margin of the greater sciatic notch, from the obturator membrane below the obturator sulcus, from the obturator margin of the inferior ramus of the pubis and from the ramus of the ischium down to the falciform ridge (Fig. 5.62, p. 395). A gap in the origin extends up under the muscle from the lesser sciatic notch (Fig. 3.55) and here a bursa lies on the bare bone beneath the muscle. The fascia over obturator internus is attached to bone at the margins of the muscle. The pudendal canal on the obturator internus fascia lies just above the falciform ridge on the ischial tuberosity (Fig. 5.67, p. 405). The transverse muscles of the perineum are attached at the anterior extremity of the ramus.

## Sex Differences

These can be surveyed in the articulated pelvis (p. 373). The female pelvis is made roomier by changes in the hip bone and the isolated bone should be surveyed from behind forwards. The ala of the ilium has been drawn out to widen the female pelvis; the greater sciatic notch is near a right angle in the female, much less in the male, and the female bone may show a preauricular sulcus below the arcuate line. The female ischial spine lies in the plane of the body of the ischium; the male spine is inverted towards the pelvic cavity. The female obturator foramen is triangular, the male foramen is oval in outline. The surest single feature is, however, that the distance from the pubic tubercle to the acetabular margin is greater than the diameter of the acetabulum in the female, equal or less in the male bone.

## Ossification

The bone develops in cartilage. Three primary centers appear, one for each bone, near the acetabulum. The center for the weight-bearing ilium appears first, at the second month, followed by the ischium at the third and pubis at the fourth month of fetal life. At birth the acetabulum is wholly cartilage, and while the ilium is a broad blade of bone the ischium and pubis are no more than tiny bars of bone buried in the cartilage. Growth of these three bones causes them later to approximate each other in a Y-shaped cartilage in the acetabulum. The ischial and pubic rami fuse with each other at about 7 years. Around the whole bone there remain strips of hyaline cartilage as follows; the whole length of the iliac crest, anterior inferior iliac spine, body of pubis at the symphysis, ischial tuberosity and sometimes ischial spine. The Y-shaped cartilage begins to ossify at about 12 years, with the appearance within it of two or three small centers of ossification (ossa acetabuli) which enlarge to fuse with each other and the surrounding bones to close the acetabulum soon after puberty (say 15 years). At the same time bony centers appear in the peripheral strips of cartilage. These fuse with the main bone when growth of the whole body ceases (say 25 years).

## Femur

The femur, the bone of the thigh, is now properly called the *os femoris* so that *femur* alone can revert to its true meaning of thigh, but like many changes in anatomical nomenclature it will be many years before the term is widely used. Note first the general features and the anatomical position of the bone. Lay it on its back on the table. This shows the forward convexity of the shaft, whose posterior concavity is buttressed by a strong ridge, the linea aspera, in its middle third. The head rises off the table, because the neck has an angle of torsion with the shaft of 30°. The neck of the femur passes from the head backwards as it slopes down to the shaft. This slope of the neck of the femur is in line with the forward and upward propulsive thrust of normal progression (walking, leaping, etc.) Hold the bone vertically, then place both condyles on the table. This produces an inclination of the shaft which is the true standing position; in life the femoral condyles rest horizontally on the plateau of the tibia. The inclination of the shaft is greater in the female, with her shorter legs and wider pelvis. In the long-legged male the shaft is nearer vertical, and the neck lies more nearly in line with the shaft (say 140°). In the female the neck makes a less obtuse angle with the shaft (say 120°). In the child the position is similar to that of the adult female; it is a matter of the length of the femur and the width of the pelvis.

The head of the femur (Figs 3.9 and 3.14), capped with hyaline cartilage, is more than half a sphere. Its medial convexity has a pit, the fovea, for the ligament of the head. Anteriorly the articular cartilage extends on the neck. This extension does not articulate with the acetabulum in standing because it is for weight-bearing in the flexed hip (try it on the dry bones). The synovial membrane of the hip joint, lining the capsule and covering the retinacular fibers on the neck, is attached to the articular margin of the head.

The neck of the femur is an upward extension of the shaft, angled as already noted. The angle is strengthened internally by the calcar femorale, a flange of compact bone projecting like a spur into the cancellous bone of the neck and adjoining shaft from the concavity of their junction, well in front of the lesser trochanter. The neck joins the shaft at the greater trochanter above and the lesser trochanter below. Many vascular foramina, directed towards the head, perforate the upper and anterior surfaces of the neck; the largest are for veins, not arteries. Grooves and ridges on the surface indicate the attachment of retinacular fibers, reflected from the attachment of the hip joint capsule to the articular margin of the head. These fibers hold down the arteries to the head (mostly from the trochanteric anastomosis) and their rupture may result in avascular necrosis of the head of the femur in intracapsular fracture of the neck. Revascularization of the head depends on new vessels crossing the fracture line, not on any within the ligament of the head. The neck joins the greater trochanter in front along a rough ridge, the intertrochanteric line. The capsule of the hip joint is attached to the line; the anterior surface of the neck with its adherent retinacular fibers is wholly intracapsular (Fig. 3.10, p. 153). The back of the neck joins the greater trochanter at a prominent rounded ridge, the intertrochanteric crest. Here the capsule of the hip joint is attached to the neck only halfway to the crest; the lower part of the neck alongside the crest is bare bone, over which the tendon of obturator externus plays (Fig. 3.15, p. 161). The intertrochanteric line, as well as receiving the anterior part of the capsule of the hip joint, gives attachment to the iliofemoral ligament (of Bigelow), whose thickest part is received into a low tubercle at the lower end of the line. The pubofemoral ligament is received into the lower surface of the neck alongside the capsular attachment. The ischiofemoral ligament reaches only the zona orbicularis (ischiocapsular ligament would be a more accurate name).

The greater trochanter projects up and back from the convexity of the junction of neck and shaft. Its upper border is projected into an inturned apex posteriorly; this carries the upper part of the attachment of gluteus medius. Piriformis is attached here and spreads forward along the upper border deep to gluteus medius. More anteriorly the medial surface of the upper border shows smooth facets for the tricipital tendon of obturator internus and the gemelli. The apex of the trochanter overlies a deep pit, the trochanteric fossa. The bottom of the pit is smooth for the attachment of the obturator externus tendon. The anterior surface of the greater trochanter shows a J-shaped ridge for the gluteus minimus tendon. The lateral surface shows a smooth oblique strip, 1 cm wide, sloping down from the apex of the greater trochanter to the middle of the J-shaped ridge. This is for the tendon of gluteus medius. An expansion from this tendon passes from the apex of the trochanter across to the ilium to blend with the iliofemoral ligament. The prominent convexity of the trochanter below gluteus medius forms the widest part of the hips. It is covered by the beginning of the iliotibial tract, where gluteus maximus is received. This plays freely over a bursa on the bare bone. Posteriorly the apex of the trochanter is continued down as the prominent intertrochanteric crest to the lesser trochanter. Nearly halfway down the crest is an oval eminence, the quadrate tubercle. Quadratus femoris is attached here, but it does not make the tubercle, which is a heaping up of bone at the epiphyseal junction. Quadratus femoris is attached to the tubercle and vertically below it down to a level that bisects the lesser trochanter.

The lesser trochanter lies back on the lowest part of the neck. Its rounded surface, facing medially, is smooth for the reception of the psoas major tendon. Iliacus is inserted into the front of the tendon and into the bone below the lesser trochanter.

The shaft of the femur is characterized by the linea aspera along its middle third posteriorly. This narrow ridge has medial and lateral lips. Note particularly their manner of formation. The intertrochanteric line slopes across the front of the neck and shaft at their junction, and continues down below the lesser trochanter as a spiral line that runs into the medial lip of the linea aspera (Fig. 3.14). The medial lip continues on as the medial supracondylar line to the adductor tubercle on the medial condyle. On the back of the shaft below the greater trochanter is a vertical ridge (sometimes a groove) for gluteus maximus. This is the gluteal tuberosity or crest and it runs down into the lateral lip of the linea aspera, and this lip is continued on as the lateral supracondylar line to the lateral epicondyle.

The intertrochanteric line in its lower half gives an aponeurotic origin to vastus medialis, which arises in continuity below this along the spiral line, medial lip of the linea aspera and upper one-third of the medial supracondylar line (the lowest part of this muscle comes from the adductor magnus tendon, not from bone). The medial surface of the femoral shaft is bare bone, over which vastus medialis plays. Vastus lateralis arises in continuity from the upper half of the trochanteric line, the lower part of the J-shaped ridge of gluteus minimus, the gluteal tuberosity, the lateral lip of the linea aspera and the upper two-thirds of the lateral supracondylar line. Vastus intermedius, arising from the front and lateral surfaces of the upper two-thirds of the shaft, extends up to the angle between the trochanteric line and gluteus minimus. Articularis genu arises a quarter of the way up the shaft below the lower limit of vastus intermedius. Thus the three vasti of the extensor compartment enclose almost the whole circumference of the shaft (Fig. 3.18).

Note the attachments in the angle between the gluteal tuberosity and the spiral line, above the linea aspera (Fig. 3.15). Psoas major and iliacus have already been seen. Pectineus is received into this area, behind and below iliacus. Adductor magnus is inserted alongside the gluteal tuberosity with its upper limit, edge to edge with quadratus femoris. Adductor brevis is inserted into the linea aspera between pectineus and adductor magnus. Adductor longus is inserted into the linea aspera below adductor brevis. The short head of biceps femoris arises from the linea aspera below adductor magnus.

The lower end of the femur carries the two condyles (Fig. 3.56), separated behind by an intercondylar notch but joined in front by a trochlear surface for the patella. The lateral condyle projects further forward than the medial, thus helping to stabilize the patella (Fig. 3.11). The articular surface of the trochlea, covered with hyaline cartilage, extends higher above the knee on the lateral than on the medial condyle. At the distal surface the lateral condyle is broad and straight, the medial narrow and curved. Both are almost flat anteroposteriorly, but boldly curved on the posterior convexities (Fig. 3.33). They are joined, below the popliteal surface of the shaft, by the intercondylar ridge that encloses the intercondylar fossa. Just above this ridge the capsule and oblique popliteal ligament of the knee are attached. In the fossa the cruciate ligaments are attached to smooth areas: the anterior cruciate ligament far back on the lateral condyle alongside the articular margin, the posterior far forward on the medial condyle alongside the articular margin (Fig. 3.56). The medial condyle shows on its convex non-articular medial surface a shallow pit the bottom of which is smooth for the tibial collateral ligament. This is the epicondyle. Above it lies the adductor tubercle at the lower end of the medial supracondylar line. On the posterior surface, between the adductor tubercle and the articular margin, is a smooth area for the tendinous fibers of the medial head of gastrocnemius. Above this a rough area is raised on the popliteal surface of the shaft by the muscular fibers of gastrocnemius. The lateral condyle shows, towards the back of its non-articular lateral surface, a vertical arrangement of three smooth-floored pits (Fig. 3.33). The upper pit is for the tendinous fibers of the lateral head of gastrocnemius. The muscular fibers of the lateral gastrocnemius arise in continuity from the lower half-inch of the lateral supracondylar line, which ends at the pit (Fig. 3.56). Above this plantaris arises from the line (Fig. 3.26). The central pit is at the prominence of the convexity of this surface, the lateral epicondyle; the fibular collateral ligament is attached to the pit. The lowermost pit receives the popliteus tendon; a groove behind the pit runs up to the articular margin for lodging the popliteus tendon when the knee is flexed.

**Figure 3.56** Lower end of the left femur from behind.

The synovial membrane of the knee joint is attached to the articular margin. The capsule is attached to the articular margin except at two places. It is attached posteriorly to the intercondylar ridge, to imprison the cruciate ligaments and it is attached laterally above the pit and groove for the popliteus, to imprison the tendon within the knee joint. Its attachment across the trochlea is a very narrow flange, because here the capsule is widely perforated for communication of the synovial membrane with the suprapatellar bursa.

**Surgical approach.** The shaft can be exposed from the front between rectus femoris and vastus lateralis by incising vastus intermedius vertically down to the bone. The posterolateral approach is in front of biceps, detaching vastus lateralis from the front of the lateral intermuscular septum and following it down to the shaft.

**Ossification.** The whole femur ossifies in cartilage. A center in the shaft appears at the eighth week of fetal life. A center for the lower end appears at the end of the ninth fetal month (at birth) and its presence is acceptable medicolegal evidence of maturity. This is the growing end of the bone, and the epiphysis, which bisects the adductor tubercle (Fig. 3.56) unites with the shaft after 20 years. A center appears in the head at 1 year of age, greater trochanter at 3 and lesser trochanter at 12 years. These upper epiphyses fuse with the shaft at about 18 years of age. Note that the neck of the femur is the upper end of the shaft and ossifies as part of it, not from an epiphysis.

## Patella

This sesamoid bone in the quadriceps tendon plays on the articular surface of the femur. Its edges form a rounded triangle, its anterior surface is gently convex. The lower border is projected down as an apex to the triangle. The articular surface, covered with hyaline cartilage, extends to the convex upper border but falls short of the lower apical part. Thus upper and lower borders can be identified. The articular surface has a vertical ridge dividing it into narrow medial and broader lateral areas; the bone laid down on a table lies on the broad lateral surface of the facet. So the right patella can easily be distinguished from the left. The narrow medial surface is further divided into two vertical strips (p. 178). The upper border of the bone receives the quadriceps tendon, the medial border receives a flat tendon from the lowest fibers of vastus medialis. The quadriceps tendon sends a few superficial fibers across the front of the bone, grooving its anterior surface, and from each side extensions (patellar retinacula) from the vasti pass down to the patellar ligament and to ridges on the tibia. The patella is attached distally to the tuberosity of the tibia by the ligament. This is attached to the patella across the whole non-articular lower border of the bone. The patellar retinacula extend down from the bone to the side of the patellar ligament before sweeping away to the tibia. The patella is set like a plug in a gap in the anterior capsule of the knee joint. The capsule and synovial membrane are attached to the articular margin. The capsule is very short at its attachment to the upper border, being here widely perforated for the synovial membrane to communicate with the suprapatellar bursa. From the lower articular margin capsule and synovial membrane pass directly across to the margin of the tibial plateau (see below).

The patella is mobile from side to side. Its upper border is level with the knee joint (tibial plateau). Stellate fractures may show no displacement of fragments if the overlying quadriceps expansions and retinacula remain intact. The bone can be removed with surprisingly little disability.

**Ossification.** The bone forms in hyaline cartilage by a center that appears at 3 years; there is sometimes more than one center. Ossification is complete soon after puberty.

## Tibia

The tibia, the larger and medial bone of the (lower) leg, has a large upper end and a smaller lower end (Fig. 3.60). The shaft is vertical in the standing position; the femur inclines up from the head of the tibia outwards to the acetabulum. Much of the bone is subcutaneous and so is easily palpable.

The upper end is widely expanded, and there is a prominent tuberosity projecting anteriorly from its lower part. The surface bone is of the very thin compact type which is fragile particularly around the margins of the upper surface or plateau. Try to secure a perfect specimen for study. Before studying the features of the upper end it is well to note the line of the epiphysis, to see whether structures are attached to it or to the shaft. The epiphyseal line cuts across the lower margin of each condyle at the back, and in front dips down to include the upper smooth part of the tuberosity (Fig. 3.57). The chief points that will be noted are that the fibular facet and the attachments of semimembranosus and the patellar ligament are on the epiphysis.

**Figure 3.57** Epiphyseal lines at the upper end of the left tibia and fibula (aged 18 years) from the front. The epiphysis includes the attachment of the patellar ligament and, towards the back, the facet for the superior tibiofibular joint.

**Figure 3.58** Superior surface of the left tibia, with ligamentous attachments indicated.

The superior articular surface or plateau shows a pair of gently concave condylar articular areas, for articulation with the menisci and the condyles of the femur (Fig. 3.58). The surface on the medial condyle is oval (long axis anteroposterior) in conformity with the medial femoral condyle and meniscus. The lateral surface is a little smaller and more nearly circular, in conformity with the lateral femoral condyle and meniscus. The medial surface does not extend beyond the margin of the plateau. The lateral surface curves down over the margin to the posterior surface of the lateral condyle (this is for movement of the lateral meniscus, p. 176). Between the condylar surfaces the plateau is elevated into the intercondylar eminence, which is grooved anteroposteriorly to form the medial and lateral intercondylar tubercles. Nothing is attached to them. The non-articular areas in front of and behind the tubercles show well-marked facets for attachment of the horns of the menisci and the cruciate ligaments (Fig. 3.29). In front of the tubercles is a large smooth area for attachment of the anterior cruciate ligament.

The lateral margin of this area receives the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus, just in front of the lateral intercondylar tubercle. Further forward, at the margin of the tibial plateau, is a round smooth facet for the anterior horn of the medial meniscus. Behind the tubercles is a smooth area sloping down to an oblique ridge between the posterior convexities of the condyles. The posterior cruciate ligament is attached to the ridge and to the smooth slope above it. The posterior horn of the medial meniscus is attached to a deep slit behind the medial intercondylar tubercle. The posterior horn of the lateral meniscus is attached, in front of the posterior cruciate ligament, just behind the lateral intercondylar tubercle.

The capsule of the knee joint is attached to the circumference of the tibial plateau except in two places. Where the tendon of popliteus crosses the margin of the tibia the capsule extends down to the head of the fibula. Between the condyles posteriorly the capsule is attached not to the margin of the plateau but to the ridge below the groove for the posterior cruciate ligament (Fig. 3.59). The synovial membrane is attached to the edge of each articular surface, following the condylar margins alongside the spine to be draped over the attachment of the anterior cruciate ligament.

The condyles lean back over the popliteal surface of the shaft (Fig. 3.59). The back of the medial condyle is deeply grooved for the semimembranosus insertion (Fig. 3.60); this groove extends around the medial contour of the bone, to receive the expansion of the tendon beneath the tibial collateral ligament. The ligament is not attached to the condyle, but to the shaft lower down. The lateral condyle carries the facet for the head of the fibula (see p. 189). The capsule and synovial membrane of this tibiofibular joint are attached to the articular margin. Just above this facet the lateral condyle may show a groove for the popliteus tendon, which plays across the bone here, lubricated by the popliteus bursa. Small upward extensions of peroneus longus and extensor digitorum longus usually encroach from the fibula on the lateral convexity of the condyle in front of the fibular facet, and an expansion from biceps femoris overlies them. The anterior surface of the lateral condyle shows a smooth facet, 1 cm in diameter, for the iliotibial tract (Fig. 3.33). Below it a ridge slopes down to the tuberosity. A similar ridge extends down from the medial condyle. Expansions from vastus lateralis and medialis, known as patellar retinacula, are attached to these ridges. The tuberosity shows a smooth oval prominence set obliquely; it receives the quadriceps insertion via the patellar ligament. The rough triangular area on the lower part of the tuberosity is subcutaneous and covered by the subcutaneous infrapatellar bursa. The space between the capsular attachment and the patellar retinacula contains soft extracapsular fat that adapts its shape to the changing contours of the femoral condyles in flexion-extension of the knee. Deep to the patellar ligament lies an infrapatellar bursa (Fig. 3.28).

**Figure 3.60** Left tibia and fibula, A. from the front, B. from behind.

The shaft of the tibia is triangular in section. Its anterior and posterior borders, with the medial surface between them, are subcutaneous. The subcutaneous surface receives the tendons of sartorius, gracilis and semitendinosus at its upper end (p. 185), and behind these the tibial collateral ligament is attached. The surface is continued at its lower end into the medial malleolus. The anterior border is sharp above, where it shows a medial convexity imprinted by tibialis anterior. This border becomes blunt below, where it continues into the anterior border of the medial malleolus. The blunt posterior border runs down into the posterior border of the medial malleolus.

On its fibular side the tibia shows a sharp interosseous border which, over 4 cm (1½ in) from the lower end, splits into two. The interosseous border gives attachment to the interosseous membrane, whose oblique fibers slope down to the fibula. In front of the interosseous border is the extensor surface of the shaft. This surface runs from the upper end below the lateral condyle to spiral over the front of the lower end of the tibia. Tibialis anterior arises from the upper two-thirds or less of this surface. Below the muscle the extensor surface of the tibia is bare. It is crossed by the tibialis anterior and extensor hallucis longus tendons. The flexor surface of the shaft lies behind the interosseous border. Its upper part is distinguished by the soleal line, which runs down obliquely from just below the tibiofibular joint across this surface to meet the posterior border one-third of the way down. Popliteus arises from the popliteal surface of the tibia above the soleal line; the popliteus fascia, a downward extension from semimembranosus tendon, is attached to the line. The upper end of the soleal line often shows a tubercle for attachment of a fibrous band that passes to the head of the fibula, bridging the posterior tibial neurovascular bundle. From this band, the soleal line, and the middle third of the posterior border the soleus arises in continuity. Below the soleal line the flexor surface shows a vertical ridge. Tibialis posterior arises between this ridge and the interosseous border (it crosses the interosseous membrane to arise also from the fibula). Medial to the ridge, between it and the posterior border, flexor digitorum longus arises. The upper part of this surface is perforated by a large nutrient foramen directed downwards. The lower part of this surface is bare bone, crossed by tibialis posterior and the overlying flexor digitorum longus.

The lower end of the tibia is rectangular in section. Medially the surface is subcutaneous, with the great saphenous vein and nerve crossing above the medial malleolus (Fig. 3.2). Anteriorly the bare bone is crossed by the tendons of tibialis anterior and extensor hallucis longus and the anterior tibial neurovascular bundle and extensor digitorum longus (Fig. 3.36). There may be a facet (the squatting facet) just above the articular margin, for articulation with the neck of the talus in full dorsiflexion of the ankle joint. Laterally the surface is triangular between the ridges that diverge from the lower end of the interosseous border; this triangular area gives attachment to the strong interosseous tibiofibular ligament. The lower part of this surface may articulate with the fibula as a synovial upward continuation of the ankle joint. Posteriorly there is a groove behind the medial malleolus, made deeper in life by thickening of periosteum at its margins. The tendon of tibialis posterior, in its synovial sheath, is lodged here, bridged by a band of fibrous tissue (Fig. 3.39). Alongside it the tendon of flexor digitorum longus crosses the bone, while on the fibular side the posterior surface has the lower end of the fleshy belly of flexor hallucis longus in contact with bare bone. The distal surface shows a saddle-shaped facet for the talus, the articular surface extending to line the medial malleolus. The capsule and synovial membrane of the ankle joint are attached to these articular margins (and to the posterior tibiofibular ligament). The distal surface of the medial malleolus shows a smooth area for the deep lamina of the deltoid ligament, and the superficial part of the ligament is attached more superficially (the deltoid ligament is as thick as the bone of the malleolus). The upper limb of the inferior extensor retinaculum is attached superficially, to the front of the malleolus.

The fascia lata of the thigh is attached to the ridges running down to the tuberosity, along with the patellar retinacula. The deep fascia of the calf is attached to the anterior and posterior borders of the shaft, down to the medial malleolus. It is thickened at the lower end of the extensor compartment as the superior extensor retinaculum (p. 186), and from the back of the medial malleolus a band passes to the calcaneus as the flexor retinaculum.

**Surgical approach.** The front of the shaft is exposed by incision over tibialis anterior and detachment of the muscle from the bone. The incision is not made over the bone itself since healing over the muscle is better. The posteromedial approach is along the posterior border of the bone, detaching soleus and flexor digitorum longus. Damaged tissue (which would not heal well) over the subcutaneous surface of the bone may necessitate a posterolateral approach, which begins by opening up the interval between peroneus longus and soleus, using the common peroneal nerve as the guide to the interval. Then flexor hallucis longus is stripped off the back of the fibula, and tibialis posterior from the fibula, interosseous membrane and the tibia. By keeping close to the bone when stripping the fibula, the peroneal vessels are displaced with the muscles.

**Ossification.** The shaft ossifies in cartilage from a primary center that appears in the 8th week of fetal life. The upper epiphysis (the growing end) shows a center immediately after birth. This joins the shaft at 20 years along the epiphyseal line already noted. A secondary center for the tuberosity may appear about puberty. The lower epiphysis ossifies at the second year and joins the shaft at 18 years. The epiphyseal line passes a centimeter above the distal end of the shaft and includes the medial malleolus; it is extracapsular.

## Fibula

The slender shaft of the fibula, the lateral bone of the leg, expands above into a quadrilateral head and below into a flattened malleolus (Fig. 3.60). Thus can upper and lower ends be identified. The vertical articular surface at the lower end has a pit, the malleolar fossa, behind it. Looking at these features enables the left and right fibulae to be distinguished: the fossa is to the left in the left fibula, to the right in the right fibula (Fig. 3.61).

**Figure 3.61** Lower ends of the left and right fibulas, distinguished by the position of the malleolar fossa behind the triangular articular area.

The head of the fibula carries an oval or round facet set obliquely on its upper surface; this articulates with a reciprocal facet on the upper epiphysis of the tibia. The capsule and synovial membrane of the superior tibiofibular joint are attached to the articular margin. The back of the head is projected upwards as the styloid process. The arcuate ligament is attached to it (p. 181). The fibular collateral ligament is attached in front of the styloid process, with biceps tendon still further forward, on the upper surface (Fig. 3.29). From the styloid process a groove for the popliteus tendon slopes down behind the articular surface.

The shaft has three surfaces, anterior, lateral and posterior, corresponding to the extensor, peroneal and flexor compartments of the leg. The lateral (peroneal) surface is smooth and easy to identify. The groove behind the lateral malleolus spirals up behind the triangular subcutaneous surface of the lower end to the lateral surface of the shaft and so up to the head. Peroneus brevis arises from the lower two-thirds of this surface and its tendon passes down to groove the back of the malleolus. Peroneus longus arises from the upper two-thirds (behind brevis where they overlap) and its tendon passes down behind that of peroneus brevis. The common peroneal nerve enters peroneus longus at the neck of the bone, the part of the shaft adjoining the head; the nerve can be rolled against the bone here, where it may be damaged by a plaster cast or tight bandaging. It also divides here into its superficial and deep branches. The superficial peroneal nerve, supplying peroneus longus and brevis, passes down to emerge between them. The deep peroneal nerve pierces the anterior peroneal septum to reach the extensor compartment of the leg. These nerves, very close to the bone, are not in actual contact with it, being cushioned by a few deep fibers of peroneus longus. The ridges that border the peroneal surface give attachment to the anterior and posterior septa that enclose the peroneal muscles.

Identify the interosseous border as follows. Above the malleolar facet is a somewhat rough triangular surface for the interosseous tibiofibular ligament (Fig. 3.61). From the apex of this triangular area a short ridge passes upwards and forks into two; the posterior one is the interosseous border and the anterior is the anterior border. The anterior surface is now seen to be extremely narrow, especially at its upper end, where in some bones the anterior and interosseous borders fuse. From the upper three-fourths of this narrow strip extensor digitorum longus takes origin, and here the deep peroneal nerve touches the bone beneath the muscle. In continuity with this muscle peroneus tertius arises from the lower third, where the anterior surface broadens somewhat. Deep to this (i.e. towards the interosseous border) extensor hallucis longus arises from the middle two-fourths of the fibula and the adjacent interosseous membrane.

The posterior (flexor) surface, between the interosseous and posterior borders, is much wider. The middle third of this surface shows a vertical ridge, the medial crest, which runs down towards the interosseous border and up towards the neck. It divides this part of the posterior surface into medial and lateral parts. To the medial part, between the medial crest and the interosseous border, tibialis posterior is attached (Fig. 3.60B; it crosses the interosseous membrane to a similar area on the tibia, lateral to the vertical line). The medial crest itself gives attachment to what is usually described as a deep intermuscular septum but which may be considered the aponeurotic fibular origin of flexor digitorum longus (Fig. 3.39). The lateral part of the posterior surface, between the medial crest and the posterior border, is for flexor hallucis longus. Below the medial crest (i.e. below the origin of tibialis posterior) flexor hallucis longus continues to arise from the whole posterior surface
