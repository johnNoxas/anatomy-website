## General Plan

The upper limb of man is built for prehension. The hand is a grasping mechanism, with four fingers flexing against an opposed thumb. The hand is furthermore the main tactile organ, with a rich nerve supply, particularly of the flexor compartment (p. 22).
![Pasted image 20250806161756.png]({{< ref "/attachments/Pasted image 20250806161756.png" >}})
In grasping, the thumb is equal in functional value to the other four fingers; loss of the thumb is as disabling as loss of all four fingers. In order to be able to grasp in any position, the forearm is provided with a range of 180° of pronation and supination, and at the elbow has a range of flexion and extension of a like amount. In addition, very free mobility is provided at the shoulder joint, and this mobility is further increased by the mobility of the pectoral girdle through which the upper limb articulates with the axial skeleton.

Although the upper limb is commonly called the arm, this term strictly refers to the upper part of the limb between the shoulder and elbow. Both the arm and the forearm (below the elbow) have anterior or flexor and posterior or extensor compartments.

There are many similarities between the upper and lower limbs, but obviously it is difficult to compare the two until the anatomy of both is understood. For this reason, discussion of this topic is deferred until page 235, after both limbs have been described.

# Pectoral Girdle
Limb girdles are defined as the bones that connect the limbs to the axial skeleton. The bones of the pectoral or shoulder girdle are the clavicle and scapula. Only one small joint connects the girdle to the rest of the skeleton — the sternoclavicular joint, and the two bones are joined to one another by an even smaller joint, the acromioclavicular. The remaining attachment to the skeleton is muscular.

In terms of comparative anatomy, the human scapula represents two bones that have become fused together; the (dorsal) scapula proper and the (ventral) coracoid. The epiphyseal line across the glenoid cavity is the line of fusion (Fig. 2.9). They are the counterparts of the ilium and ischium of the pelvic girdle. The counterpart of the pubis is a tiny piece of bone (precoracoid) that ossifies separately at the tip of the coracoid process; it takes no part in the formation of the shoulder joint. The clavicle, ossifying in membrane, is an added bone (it has no counterpart in the pelvic girdle) whose purpose is to act as a strut preventing medial movement of the scapula. The strong coracoclavicular ligament attaches the clavicle and scapula to each other, and the clavicle is anchored to the first costal cartilage by the costoclavicular ligament. Forces from the upper limb are transmitted by the clavicle to the axial skeleton through these ligaments, and neither end of the clavicle normally transmits much force.

### Embryology
Muscles developed in the upper limb are supplied by branches from the brachial plexus. During their development, some of these muscles migrate for considerable distances to gain attachment to the trunk; but they continue to be innervated from the brachial plexus. Motor supply, once established in the embryo, never changes thereafter. An example is latissimus dorsi which, notwithstanding its very wide attachment to the trunk, still retains its supply from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus. Other muscles, not developed in the limb, migrate from the trunk and gain attachment to the girdle; e.g., sternocleidomastoid and trapezius, supplied by the accessory nerve, attach themselves to the clavicle and scapula. The nerve supply tells the story of the development of any muscle.

### Movements

The essential functional requirement of the pectoral girdle is mobility on the thorax to enhance the mobility of the shoulder joint. And it is a fact that all movement between the humerus and glenoid cavity, except very slight movement, is accompanied by an appropriate movement of the scapula itself. Nor can the scapula move without making its supporting strut, the clavicle, move also. Generally speaking, the shoulder joint, the acromioclavicular and sternoclavicular joints all move together in harmony, providing a kind of thoraco-humeral articulation. It is important to appreciate this, for functional defects in any part of the thoraco-humeral articulation must impair the whole. But to understand the mechanisms involved, it is essential to analyze the composite movement into its constituent parts, and this is done with the glenohumeral joint on page 76 and with the clavicular joints on pages 61 and 62.

The bones of the pectoral girdle are described on page 127.
## Muscles of the Pectoral Girdle

Direct attachment of the pectoral girdle to the trunk is provided by muscles that are inserted into the clavicle or scapula from the axial skeleton. These muscles are pectoralis minor, subclavius, trapezius, the rhomboids, levator scapulae, and serratus anterior. Indirect attachment to the axial skeleton is secured by the great muscles of the axillary folds (pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi); these muscles, by way of the upper end of the humerus, move the pectoral girdle on the trunk. Their descriptions are included here.

The muscular attachments between the upper limb and pectoral girdle include the deltoid and short scapular muscles, which are inserted about the upper end of the humerus, and the biceps and long head of triceps which, running over the humerus, are inserted beyond the elbow joint into the bones of the forearm. All these muscles are important factors in giving stability to the very mobile shoulder joint across which they lie, and are described with the shoulder region (p. 72).

### Pectoralis Major

{{< figure src="/attachments/Pasted image 20250806161247.png" title="title of image" width="400">}}


From clavicular and sternocostal heads, this large triangular muscle converges on the upper humerus, folding on itself where it forms the anterior axillary wall to become attached to the humerus by means of a trilaminar tendon.

The clavicular head arises from the medial half of the anterior surface of the clavicle over a smooth flattened area which is easily seen on most clavicles. Running almost horizontally laterally, the fibers of this head lie in a groove on the manubrial part of the muscle, from which they are quite separate. They are inserted by the anterior lamina of the tendon into the lateral lip of the intertubercular (bicipital) groove of the humerus, into the anterior lip of the deltoid tuberosity and, below that, into the deep fascia of the arm.

The sternocostal head arises from the lateral part of the anterior surface of the manubrium and body of the sternum, and from the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle over the upper attachment of rectus abdominis. On the deep surface of this sheet of muscle, and in continuity with it, fibers arise by a series of slips from the upper six costal cartilages. The manubrial fibers are inserted by tendon into the lateral lip of the intertubercular groove behind (deep to) the clavicular fibers as far down as the upper part of the deltoid tuberosity. They form the intermediate lamina of the insertion. The sternocostal fibers, arising from below the sternal angle, course upwards and laterally to be inserted progressively higher into the posterior lamina of the tendon, producing the rounded appearance of the anterior axillary fold. The fibers which arise lowest of all are thus inserted highest of all in the posterior leaf of the tendon. The uppermost limit of the insertion of the posterior leaf is, by a crescentic fold, into the capsule of the shoulder joint (Fig. 2.1). The anterior leaf is not inserted as high as this, its uppermost limit being on a level with the surgical neck of the humerus.


**Fig 2.1** Insertion of the right pectoralis major. Pan afthe clavicular head has been removed and deltoid incised and retncted to show how the lowest fibres of the sternocostal origin twist upwards to the manubrial fibres.

Like most limb girdle muscles, there is some doubt about how much of pectoralis major is developed from the limb bud and how much from myotomes of the trunk, with migration in either direction. On dissection, 1 body in 20 shows the presence of vertical musculo-aponeurotic fibers on the surface of the pectoralis major alongside the sternum (Fig. 2.2). This is the rectus sternalis muscle, a derivative of the superficial layer of the rectus abdominis (p. 298); it is supplied segmentally by intercostal nerves. Its upper fibers usually fuse with the sternal tendon of sternocleidomastoid.


**Fig. 2.2** Right rectus sternalis, an occasional derivative of rectus abdominis.

**Nerve supply.** From the brachial plexus via the medial and lateral pectoral nerves, so named because of their origins from the medial and lateral cords of the plexus. The medial pectoral pierces pectoralis minor (and therefore supplies it) and the lateral pectoral pierces the clavipectoral fascia medial to the pectoralis minor. Both nerves enter the deep surface of pectoralis major. The muscle is the only one in the upper limb to be supplied by all five segments of the brachial plexus; C5, 6 supply the clavicular head and C7, 8, T1 the sternocostal part, but the segments mainly involved are C6, 7, 8. The degree of paralysis of pectoralis major may be helpful in gauging the extent of a brachial plexus injury (p. 125).

**Action.** The muscle is a medial rotator of the arm and, in combination with the muscles of the posterior axillary fold, particularly the latissimus dorsi, a powerful adductor of the arm. It is especially well developed in climbing and flying animals. The sternocostal fibers are the chief adductors; the clavicular head assists in flexion at the shoulder joint. With the upper limb fixed in abduction, the muscle is a useful accessory muscle of inspiration, drawing the ribs upwards towards the humerus.

**Test.** For the clavicular head, the arm is abducted to 90° or more and the patient pushes the arm forwards against resistance. For the sternocostal head, the arm is abducted to 60° and then adducted against resistance. The contracting heads can be seen and felt.

### Pectoralis Minor

In contrast to pectoralis major whose costal fibers arise from cartilage, this small triangular muscle arises from bone, usually from the third, fourth, and fifth ribs under cover of pectoralis major (Fig. 2.12). Variations in this origin are common, the muscle being often prefixed (from the second, third, and fourth ribs) and occasionally postfixed (from the fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs). The insertion is by a short thick tendon into the medial border and upper surface of the coracoid process of the scapula (not to the tip of the process, which is fully occupied by biceps and coracobrachialis).

Of no great functional significance, the muscle is an important landmark, being the guide to the underlying axillary artery (p. 65) and the cords of the brachial plexus (p. 68).

**Nerve supply.** By both pectoral nerves (C6, 7, 8).

**Action.** It assists serratus anterior in protraction of the scapula, keeping the anterior (glenoid) angle in apposition with the chest wall as the vertebral border is drawn forwards by serratus anterior. The muscle is elongated when the scapula rotates in full abduction of the arm; its subsequent contraction assists gravity in restoring the scapula to the rest position.

### Subclavius

This small and unimportant muscle arises from the costochondral junction of the first rib and is inserted into the subclavian groove on the inferior surface of the clavicle. The muscle thus lies almost horizontally. It is enclosed by the upper attachment of the clavipectoral fascia (Fig. 2.3).

**Nerve supply.** By its own nerve from the upper trunk of the brachial plexus (C5, 6); it runs down from the point of formation of the upper trunk to enter the posterior surface of the muscle.

**Action.** It assists in stabilizing the clavicle in movements of the pectoral girdle. It may prevent the jagged ends of a fractured clavicle from damaging the adjacent subclavian vein.
#### Clavipectoral Fascia

The clavipectoral fascia is a sheet of membrane filling in the space between the clavicle and pectoralis minor, limited laterally by the coracoid process and passing medially to fuse with the external intercostal membrane of the upper two spaces. It splits above to enclose subclavius, being attached to the anterior and posterior ridges which limit the subclavian groove on the under surface of the clavicle. These two layers reappear above the clavicle as the lower attachment of the investing layer of deep cervical fascia (p. 421), but there is no physical continuity between them, each fascia being firmly attached to the clavicle above and below, not passing over the bone (Fig. 2.3).

At the lower border of subclavius, the two layers fuse and may form a well-developed band, the costocoracoid ligament, stretching from the knuckle of the coracoid to the first costochondral junction. From this ligament, the fascia stretches as a loosely felted membrane to the upper border of pectoralis minor, which muscle is enclosed by the splitting of the membrane into anterior and posterior leaves. These leaves are very thin and amount to little more than the epimysium of the muscle. They rejoin below pectoralis minor to extend downwards as the suspensory ligament of the axilla (Fig. 2.3). The latter is attached to the axillary fascia over the floor of the axilla, and by its tension maintains the axillary hollow.

![Pasted image 20250806161756.png]({{< ref "/attachments/Pasted image 20250806161756.png" >}})
**Fig 2.3** Vertical section of the left looking laterally towards the ann. The clavipcctoral fascia enclosed subclavius and pectoralis minor, below which it becomes the suspensory ligament of the axilla, joining the axillary fascia which arches upwards between pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi. The neurovascular bundle of the upper limb lies between the anterior and posterior axillary walls

The clavipectoral fascia is almost covered by pectoralis major and the anterior fibers of the deltoid, but a small extent appears in the infraclavicular fossa in the interval between these two muscles. In this situation, it is pierced by four structures - two passing inwards, two passing outwards. Passing inwards are lymphatics from the infraclavicular nodes to the apical nodes of the axilla, and the cephalic vein; passing outwards are the thoracoacromial vessels and the lateral pectoral nerve. The thoracoacromial artery has four main branches of distribution: clavicular, humeral, acromial, and pectoral. These frequently pierce the fascia separately; their corresponding veins, however, join the cephalic vein anterior to the fascia. This is a characteristic arrangement in anatomy (compare, for example, with branches of the femoral artery below the groin, piercing the fascia lata separately from the veins which join the great saphenous vein before the latter pierces the cribriform fascia, p. 147).

### Trapezius

This large flat muscle, the most superficial of the upper part of the back, arises in the midline from the skull to the lower thorax and converges on the outer part of the pectoral girdle, which it rotates upwards. Its origin extends from the medial third of the superior nuchal line to the spine of C7 vertebra, finding attachment to the ligamentum nuchae between the external occipital protuberance and the vertebral spine. Below this, the origin extends along the spinous processes and supraspinous ligaments of all 12 thoracic vertebrae. Opposite the upper thoracic spines, the muscle shows a triangular aponeurotic area, which makes a diamond with that of the opposite side (Fig. 2.6).

The occipital fibers are inserted into the lateral third of the clavicle at its posterior border; from above downwards, the fibers can be traced into their insertion along the medial border of the acromion and the superior lip of the crest of the scapular spine (Fig. 2.16). The part of the muscle which arises from the lowest half-dozen thoracic spines is inserted by a narrow recurved tendon into the medial end of the spine; this tendon slides over the bare area at the base of the spine of the scapula, a bursa intervening (Fig. 2.6).

**Nerve supply.** From the spinal part of the accessory nerve (C1-5 or 6) and branches from the cervical plexus (C3 and 4), the latter normally being only proprioceptive. These nerves cross the posterior triangle to enter the deep surface of trapezius, although in some cases they do appear to contain motor fibers (p. 427). The accessory nerve can be distinguished from the cervical branches by the fact that it emerges from within the substance of sternocleidomastoid; the cervical nerves emerge from behind sternocleidomastoid.

**Action.** All fibers help to retract the scapula (pull it towards the midline), while the upper and lower fibers are important in scapular rotation - tilting the glenoid cavity upwards, an essential component of abduction of the shoulder. In this action, some upper fibers elevate the acromion while some lower fibers depress the medial end of the spine, like turning a wing nut (Fig. 2.4), and in this they are strongly assisted by the lowest four digitations of serratus anterior (p. 60). The upper fibers can elevate the whole scapula (shrug the shoulder) or prevent its depression (as when carrying something heavy). They can also produce lateral flexion of the neck, but acting with the upper fibres of the opposite side they can extend the neck.

![Pasted image 20250806162200.png]({{< ref "Pasted image 20250806162200.png" >}})
**Fig. 2.4** Rotation of the scapula. The upper and lower parts of trapezius pull on the scapular spine in different directions, twisting it like a wing-nut, while serratus anterior pulls on the inferior angle.

**Test.** The shoulder is shrugged against resistance and the upper border of the muscle is seen and felt. If paralysed, the combined actions of levator scapulae and serratus anterior may compensate.
### Latissimus Dorsi

This muscle, covering such a large area of the back, is characterized by its very wide origin and its very narrow insertion. It is a derivative of the upper limb myotomes, and so is supplied by a branch of the brachial plexus.

The origin commences above, at the spine of T7 vertebra, and extends downwards along the spinous processes and supraspinous ligaments of all the lumbar and sacral vertebrae. Fleshy in the thoracic portion, the origin becomes aponeurotic in the lumbar and sacral region, and fuses with the posterior layer of the lumbar fascia, by which layer it also arises from the central ridge on the posterior part of the crest of the ilium (Fig. 2.5). Lateral to this, it arises by flesh from the posterior third of the outer lip of the iliac crest. The upper border of the flat sheet of muscle runs horizontally, and is covered by the lower triangular part of trapezius, and flows over the inferior angle of the scapula, from which a few fibers arise to join t he muscle (Fig. 2.6). The lateral border of the muscle, thicker and more rounded than its thin upper border, runs vertically upwards, being reinforced by four slips from the lowest four ribs, whose fibers of origin interdigitate with those of the external oblique. This lateral border of latissimus dorsi forms a boundary of the lumbar triangle (Fig. 2.5 and p. 296). The muscle converges towards the posterior axillary fold, of which it forms the lower border. The fibers, sweeping spirally around the lower border of teres major, are replaced by a flattened tendon about 2.5 cm broad which is inserted into the floor of the intertubercular groove (Fig. 2.10). The surfaces of the muscle, anterior and posterior, are reversed at the insertion of the tendon as a result of the spiral turn around teres major. This glistening white tendon contrasts with adjacent muscle and is a useful landmark in the lower posterior wall of the axilla.

**Nerve supply.** By the thoracodorsal nerve (C6, 7, 8) from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus. It is vulnerable in operations on the axilla, for in its course down the posterior wall it slopes forwards to enter the medial surface of the muscle just behind its anterior border (Fig. 2.15). The latissimus dorsi is developed in the extensor compartment of the limb and migrates to its wide attachment on the trunk, taking its nerve with it.

**Action.** It extends the shoulder joint and medially rotates the humerus (e.g., folding the arms behind the back, or scratching the opposite scapula), but in combination with pectoralis major it is a powerful adductor. Especially used in restoring the upper limb from abduction above the shoulder, it is essentially the climbing muscle.

Its costal fibers of origin can assist in deep inspiration, elevating the lower four ribs towards the fixed humerus. But the remainder of the muscle, sweeping from the vertebral column around the convexity of the posterolateral chest wall, compresses the lower thorax and is an accessory muscle of expiration. These fibers sometimes become sore after prolonged attacks of severe coughing.

In spinal injury, the muscle may move the pelvis and trunk; it is the only muscle of the upper limb to have a pelvic attachment (via the lumbar fascia). A recent innovation is its use in cardiomyoplasty: the muscle is wrapped round the heart with its nerve supply intact and stimulated by a pulse generator so that it can act as a biological assist device.

**Test.** The arm is abducted to a right angle and then adducted against resistance; the anterior border of the muscle below the posterior axillary fold can be seen and felt. The muscle can also be felt to contract here when the patient coughs.

### Triangle of Auscultation

The upper horizontal border of the muscle forms with the vertebral border of the scapula and the lateral border of trapezius the triangle of auscultation (Fig. 2.5). A fascial sheet, which encloses latissimus dorsi and the rhomboids, floors in the triangle superficial to the seventh rib and sixth and seventh intercostal spaces. The triangle is so named because deep to it, on the left side, is the cardiac orifice of the stomach, where the splash of swallowed liquids was timed in cases of esophageal obstruction in preradiological days.

### Rhomboid Major

Rhomboid major arises from four vertebral spines (T2-5), and the intervening supraspinous ligaments. Its insertion into the scapula (Fig. 2.6) extends from the inferior angle to the upper part of the triangular area at the base of the scapular spine; a fibrous arch receives the fibers of the muscle between these two points. The fibrous arch is often only loosely attached to the vertebral border of the scapula except at its ends (like the bony origin of levator ani, p. 375).

### Rhomboid Minor

Rhomboid minor is a narrow ribbon of muscle parallel with the above, arising from two vertebral spines (C7, T1) and inserted into the medial border of the scapula above the triangular area and below the attachment of levator scapulae (Fig. 2.16).

**Nerve supplies.** By the dorsal scapular nerve (nerve to the rhomboids) from the C5 root of the brachial plexus which passes through scalenus medius, runs down deep to levator scapulae (which it supplies) and lies on the serratus posterior superior muscle to the medial side of the descending branch of the transverse cervical artery (Fig. 2.6). It supplies each rhomboid on the deep surface.

**Actions.** The rhomboids draw the vertebral border of the scapula medially and upwards. They are antagonists to the rotatory action of trapezius; they contract with trapezius in squaring the shoulders, i.e., retracting the scapula.

**Test.** With the hand on the hip or behind the back, the patient pushes the elbow backwards against resistance and braces the shoulder back. The muscles are palpated at the vertebral border of the scapula; being deep to trapezius they are not always visible. If the rhomboids of one side are paralyzed, the scapula of the affected side remains farther from the midline than that of the normal side.

### Levator Scapulae

A strap-like muscle which appears in the floor of the posterior triangle, it arises from the posterior tubercles (i.e., from true transverse processes) of the upper four cervical vertebrae by slender slips of tendon. The four slips fuse into the long belly, which usually is longitudinally split. It courses downwards to be inserted into the upper angle of the scapula. It may not be derived from the upper limb myotomes, but from the external of the three layers of the body wall (p. 242).

**Nerve supply.** From the cervical plexus (C3, 4, anterior rami), reinforced by the dorsal scapular nerve (nerve to the rhomboids, C5).

**Action.** Similar to the rhomboid muscles (above). Like the upper part of trapezius, it can laterally rotate the neck, or (with its opposite fellow) extend the neck.

### Serratus Anterior

This is a broad sheet of thick muscle (Fig. 2.15) which clothes the side wall of the thorax and forms the medial wall of the axilla. It arises by a series of digitations from the upper eight ribs. The first digitation, which appears in the posterior triangle, arises from the outer border of the first rib and also from the rough impression which characterizes the second rib. Over its upper border passes the neurovascular bundle from the posterior triangle to the axilla. The second digitation arises from the second rib and is inserted, together with the first, into the upper angle of the scapula. (This part of the muscle is innervated from C5). The third and fourth digitations arise from the third and fourth ribs and form a thin sheet of muscle which spreads out to be inserted into the length of the costal surface of the scapula along a narrow strip at its vertebral border. (This part is innervated from C6.) The lower four digitations arise from the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth ribs, interdigitating with the slips of origin of external oblique at the anterior angles of the ribs. Thick, fleshy muscles, they converge strongly on the inferior angle of the scapula. (They are supplied by C7.) The muscle is covered by a strong well-developed fascia.

**Nerve supply.** By the long thoracic nerve (nerve to serratus anterior) which arises from the roots of the brachial plexus (C5, 6, 7). The branches from C5 and 6 join in the scalenus medius muscle and emerge from its lateral border as a single trunk which enters the axilla by passing over the first digitation of serratus anterior. The contribution from C7 also passes over the first digitation of serratus anterior and joins the former nerve on the medial wall of the axilla (i.e., on the surface of serratus anterior) to form the nerve to serratus anterior (Fig. 2.7). The nerve lies behind the midaxillary line (i.e., behind the lateral branches of the intercostal arteries) on the surface of the muscle (Fig. 2.15), deep to the fascia, and is thus protected in operations on the axilla. The muscle is supplied segmentally; C5 into the upper two digitations, C6 into the next two, and C7 into the lower four digitations.

**Action.** The whole muscle contracting en masse protracts the scapula (punching and pushing), thus effectively elongating the upper limb. A further highly important action is that of the lower four digitations, which powerfully assist trapezius in rotating the scapula laterally and upwards in raising the arm above the level of the shoulder. In this action, it is a more powerful rotator than trapezius. In all positions, the muscle keeps the vertebral border of the scapula in firm apposition with the chest wall.

**Test.** The outstretched hand is pushed against a wall. A number of digitations should be seen and felt on the lateral chest wall. Paralysis results in winged scapula, where the vertebral border becomes prominently raised off the posterior chest wall.

## Sternoclavicular Joint

This is a synovial joint, separated into two cavities by an intervening disc of fibrocartilage. Although synovial, it is atypical since the bony surfaces are covered by fibrocartilage, not the usual hyaline variety. The articular surface on the manubrium sterni is set at an angle of 45° with the perpendicular, and is markedly concave from above downwards. The articular surface on the sternal end of the clavicle, flattened or slightly concave, is continued over the inferior surface of the shaft in a high percentage of cases, for articulation with the first costal cartilage. The sternal end of the clavicle projects well above the upper margin of the manubrial facet (Fig. 2.8) so that only about the lower half of the clavicular articular surface lies opposite the sternal articular facet.

The interclavicular ligament joins the upper borders of the sternal ends of the two clavicles and is itself attached to the suprasternal (jugular) notch. The costoclavicular ligament binds the clavicle to the first costal cartilage and the adjacent end of the first rib, just lateral to the joint; it is an accessory ligament thereof. It is in two laminae (usually separated by a bursa), which are attached to the anterior and posterior lips of the ligamentous impression on the clavicle. The fibers of the anterior lamina run upwards and laterally, and those of the posterior lamina upwards and medially (these are the same directions as those of the external and internal intercostal muscles). The ligament is very strong and is the major stabilizing factor of the sternoclavicular joint.

**Nerve supply.** The medial supraclavicular nerves (C3, 4) from the cervical plexus give articular branches to the capsule and ligaments.

**Movements.** The fulcrum of movements at this joint is not the sternal end of the clavicle, but the costoclavicular ligament. As the lateral end of the clavicle moves, its medial end moves in the opposite direction. This can be readily demonstrated by simple palpation (feel your own!). Elevate the acromial end by shrugging the shoulder; the sternal end moves down. Only in complete elevation of the acromial end, as in full abduction of the arm, when the medial end of the clavicle can be depressed no further, is the ligament put on full stretch. Depress the acromial end of the clavicle by drooping the shoulder; the sternal end moves up. Upward movement of the sternal end is halted by the interclavicular ligament, and especially by the intra-articular disc (Fig. 2.8). Protrude the acromial end of the clavicle by hunching the shoulders forward; the sternal end moves back. Retract the acromial end by squaring the shoulders; the sternal end moves forward.

The clavicle moves about the costoclavicular ligament like a see-saw in both the horizontal and the coronal planes. In shrugging the shoulder, the clavicle moves on the disc; in protracting the scapula, the clavicle moves with the disc.

A further movement takes place at the sternoclavicular joint, namely rotation. Rotation of the clavicle is passive; there are no rotator muscles. It is produced by rotation of the scapula and transmitted to the clavicle through the coracoclavicular ligaments (see below). Palpate the forward convexity of the clavicle. Flex the arm in the sagittal plane and continue upwards in this plane to full abduction above the head. Restore the arm and carry it back in the sagittal plane into full extension. The rotation of the clavicle can be easily felt; it amounts, in fact, to some 40°.

Elevation and depression of the acromial end of the clavicle, resulting in movements downwards and upwards respectively of the sternal end, cause movement between the clavicle and the disc. Forward and backward movements in the horizontal plane result in movements between the fibrocartilage and manubrium, the former moving with the sternal end of the clavicle. Similarly, in rotary movements (abduction of the arm above the head), the disc moves with the clavicle.

The stability of the joint is maintained by the ligaments, most especially the costoclavicular ligament. It takes all strain off the joint, transmitting stress from clavicle to first costal cartilage. The latter is itself immovably fixed to the manubrium by a primary cartilaginous joint (p. 243). Dislocation is unusual; the clavicle breaks in preference.

## Acromioclavicular Joint

This is a synovial joint between the overhanging lateral end of the clavicle and the underhanging medial border of the acromion. The articulating surfaces are covered (like those of the sternoclavicular joint) by fibrocartilage (so it is an atypical synovial joint).

A sleeve-like capsule surrounds the articular surfaces; it is not strong, but on top there is a thickening of fibers which constitutes the acromioclavicular ligament. An incomplete disc of fibrocartilage hangs down into the upper part of the joint cavity.

The coracoclavicular ligament, extremely strong, is the principal factor in providing stability to the joint. It consists of two parts, conoid and trapezoid (Fig. 2.9). Examine the clavicle and scapula. The conoid ligament, an inverted cone, extends upwards from the knuckle of the coracoid to a wider attachment around the conoid tubercle, on the under surface of the clavicle (Fig. 2.58). The trapezoid ligament is attached to the ridge of the same name on the upper surface of the coracoid process and extends laterally, in an almost horizontal plane, to the trapezoid ridge on the under surface of the clavicle (Fig. 2.58).

**Nerve supply.** By lateral supraclavicular nerves (C4) from the cervical plexus.

**Movements.** These are passive (compare with the superior tibiofibular joint, p. 189); no muscle connects the bones to move the joint. Muscles which move the scapula cause it to move on the clavicle. Scapular movements on the chest wall fall into three groups: (1) protraction and retraction around the chest wall, (2) rotation, and (3) elevation or depression. These basic movements can be combined in varying proportions, and each of these transmits, through ligaments, corresponding movements to the clavicle. All movements of the scapula involve movements in the joint at either end of the clavicle.

Horizontally, in protraction and retraction of the tip of the shoulder, the scapula hugs the thoracic wall, held to it by serratus anterior and pectoralis minor. The scapula moves in a circle of a shorter radius (i.e., the radius of the upper thorax) than the length of the clavicle. Hence movement takes place between the acromion and the fibrocartilage. The axis of this movement is vertical and passes through the sternoclavicular joint.

In abduction of the arm, the scapula does not retain its position relative to the clavicle but rotates around the conoid ligament as it swings forwards on the chest wall, and movement takes place between the fibrocartilage and the clavicle. The axis of scapular rotation passes through the conoid ligament and the acromioclavicular joint; the scapula swings to and fro like a pendulum below these two fixed points on the clavicle. The total range of scapular rotation on the chest wall is about 60°, but only 20° of this occurs between the scapula and the clavicle. The coracoclavicular ligaments are then taut, and transmit the rotating force to the clavicle, whose rotation then accounts for the remainder of scapular rotation on the chest wall. In both movements at this joint, the fulcrum around which the scapula swings is the coracoclavicular ligament.

The stability of the joint is provided by the coracoclavicular ligament. The scapula and upper limb hang suspended from the clavicle by the conoid ligament (assisted by the deltoid, biceps, and triceps muscles). Forces transmitted medially from the upper limb to the glenoid cavity are transmitted from scapula to clavicle by the trapezoid ligament and from clavicle to first rib by the costoclavicular ligament. Thus a fall on an outstretched hand or elbow puts no strain on either end of the clavicle at the joints. If the clavicle fractures as a result, it always does so between these ligaments. Falls on the shoulder may dislocate the acromioclavicular joint, forcing the acromion under the clavicle and tearing the coracoclavicular ligament.

## Axilla

The axilla is the space between the upper arm and the side of the thorax, bounded in front and behind by the axillary folds, communicating above with the posterior triangle of the neck and containing neurovascular structures, including lymph nodes, for the upper limb and the side wall of the thorax. Its floor is the axillary fascia extending from the fascia over the serratus anterior to the deep fascia of the arm, attached in front and behind to the margins of the axillary folds, and supported by the suspensory ligament (Fig. 2.3) from the lower border of pectoralis minor. Its anterior wall is completed by pectoralis major, pectoralis minor, subclavius, and the clavipectoral fascia; these have been described on page 54. The posterior wall extends lower; it is formed by subscapularis and teres major (see below), with the tendon of latissimus dorsi winding around the latter muscle. The medial wall is formed by the upper part of serratus anterior, the lower limit of the axilla being defined as the level of the fourth rib. The anterior and posterior walls converge laterally to the lips of the intertubercular groove of the humerus (Fig. 2.10).

The axilla virtually does not exist when the arm is fully abducted. Its folds disappear as their muscles run tangentially along the humerus, and the axillary hollow is replaced by a bulge.

### Subscapularis

This arises from the medial four-fifths of the costal surface of the scapula, from the intermuscular septa which raise bony ridges on this surface and from the concave axillary border of the scapula up to the infraglenoid tubercle (Fig. 2.10). The multipennate muscle converges over the bare area at the lateral angle of the scapula, its musculotendinous fibers sliding over this bone and separated from it by a bursa. This subscapular bursa (Fig. 2.11) extends laterally and communicates with the cavity of the shoulder joint through a gap in the anterior part of its capsule between the superior and middle glenohumeral ligaments. Lateral to this, the tendon fuses with the capsule of the shoulder joint and is inserted into the lesser tuberosity of the humerus and the medial lip of its intertubercular groove for half an inch below (Fig. 2.10). The muscle is covered by a dense fascia which is attached to the scapula at the margins of its origin.

**Nerve supply.** By the upper and lower subscapular nerves (C5, 6) from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus.

**Action.** With the other short scapular muscles, the subscapularis gives stability to the shoulder joint, assisting in fixation of the upper end of the humerus during movements of the elbow, wrist, and hand. Acting as a prime mover, it is a medial rotator of the humerus.

There is no satisfactory test for the muscle, since its action is difficult to differentiate from other medial rotators.

### Teres Major

This is an offspring of subscapularis. It has migrated around to the dorsal surface of the scapula, where it arises from an oval area on the lateral side of the inferior angle. It runs edge to edge with the lower border of its parent subscapularis, and is inserted in continuity with it into the medial lip of the intertubercular groove. The ribbon-like tendon of latissimus dorsi winds around its lower border and comes to lie in front of the upper part of the muscle at its insertion (Fig. 2.10).

**Nerve supply.** By the lower subscapular nerve (C5, 6), which supplies its parent subscapularis, and lies in the angle between the subscapular and circumflex scapular arteries, entering the anterior surface of the muscle.

**Action.** It assists the other short muscles in steadying the upper end of the humerus in movements at the periphery of the limb; acting alone, it is an adductor and medial rotator of the humerus at the shoulder joint, and helps to extend the flexed arm. With teres minor, it holds down the upper end of the humerus as deltoid pulls up the bone into abduction (Fig. 2.20). Its tendon can be transplanted posteriorly to provide lateral rotation.

**Test.** The abducted arm is adducted against resistance, and the muscle is seen and felt from behind the posterior axillary fold.

### Quadrangular and Triangular Spaces

The quadrangular space lies between subscapularis and teres major in the posterior wall of the axilla. It is bounded laterally by the humerus and medially by the long head of triceps (Fig. 2.10). It transmits the axillary nerve, with the posterior circumflex humeral artery and vein inferiorly. Viewed from behind, the quadrangular space is bounded above by the teres minor muscle; its three other boundaries are the same (Fig. 2.16). The triangular space, below teres major and between the humerus and the long head of triceps, transmits the radial nerve and profunda brachii vessels.

### Axillary Artery

The axilla transmits the neurovascular bundle from the neck to the upper limb.

The three cords of the brachial plexus are formed behind the clavicle and enter the upper part of the axilla above the artery. The cords approach the artery and embrace its second part (Fig. 2.12), the part which lies under cover of the pectoralis minor, lying medial, lateral, and posterior to it in the manner indicated by their names. The axillary vein lies throughout on the medial side of the artery and nerves. In the fibrofatty areolar tissue of the axilla lie several groups of lymph nodes.

This is the continuation of the third part of the subclavian artery. It enters the apex of the axilla by passing over the first digitation of serratus anterior, at the outer border of the first rib, behind the midpoint of the clavicle. It is invested in fascia, the axillary sheath, projected down from the prevertebral fascia (Fig. 6.6, p. 441). At the lower border of teres major, it becomes the brachial artery. It is conveniently divided into three parts by pectoralis minor: the part above, the part behind, and the part below. The second part, that behind the muscle, is readily recognized in a dissected axilla, where pectoralis minor has been removed, as that part of the artery which is clasped by the three cords of the plexus laterally, medially, and posteriorly (Fig. 2.12).

The shape of the artery depends upon the position of the arm. With the arm at the side, the artery has a bold curve with its convexity lateral, and its third part is clasped by the two heads of the median nerve. With the arm laterally rotated and abducted, as in operations upon the axilla, the artery pursues a straight course and the two heads of the median nerve lie loosely upon its third part.

The surface marking of the artery, when the arm is by the side, is indicated by a curved line from the middle of the clavicle running below the coracoid process to the groove behind coracobrachialis.

**Surgical approach.** The first part of the artery can be exposed by splitting the clavicular head of pectoralis major in the line of its fibers and incising the clavipectoral fascia. The rest of the artery is approached through the axilla, above the posterior fold in the groove between coracobrachialis and the long head of triceps.

**Branches.** Apart from some inconstant superior thoracic twigs to the upper axillary walls, it may be said that the first part has one branch, the second part two, and the third part three branches.

The superior thoracic artery, from the first part, runs forwards to supply both pectoral muscles.

The thoracoacromial and lateral thoracic arteries arise from the second part. The thoracoacromial artery skirts the upper border of pectoralis minor to pierce the clavipectoral fascia, often separately in its four terminal branches (clavicular, deltoid, acromial, and pectoral). These branches radiate away at right angles from each other.

The lateral thoracic artery follows the lower border of pectoralis minor, close to the pectoral lymph nodes, on the fascia over serratus anterior, supplying branches to pectoralis minor and major and, in the female, being an important contributor of blood to the breast.

The subscapular and the two circumflex humeral arteries arise from the third part. The subscapular artery, the largest branch of the axillary, runs down the posterior axillary wall, giving off a dorsal branch, the circumflex scapular artery, which passes through the posterior wall of the axilla between subscapularis and teres major, medial to the long head of the triceps. Distal to this branch, the subscapular artery changes its name to thoracodorsal, and runs with the nerve of the same name into latissimus dorsi.

The anterior circumflex humeral artery runs deep to coracobrachialis and both heads of biceps (giving here an ascending branch which runs up the intertubercular groove to the long tendon of biceps and the capsule of the shoulder joint), and passes around the surgical neck of the humerus to anastomose with the posterior circumflex humeral artery. This, a much larger branch of the axillary artery, passes through the posterior axillary wall between subscapularis and teres major lateral to the long head of triceps, between it and the humerus (i.e., through the quadrangular space). It is accompanied above by the axillary nerve and, like it, supplies the deltoid. It also gives branches to the long and lateral heads of triceps and the shoulder joint, and anastomoses with the profunda brachii artery.

### Axillary Vein

The venae comitantes of the brachial artery are joined by the basilic vein above the lower border of the posterior wall of the axilla. They form the axillary vein, which courses upwards on the medial side of the axillary artery and leaves the axilla by passing through its apex anterior to the third part of the subclavian artery. Over the upper surface of the first rib, in front of scalenus anterior, it continues as the subclavian vein. Tributaries of the third and second parts of the axillary vein are the same as the branches of the artery. Into the first part (i.e., above pectoralis minor), the cephalic vein enters after having pierced the clavipectoral fascia. There is no axillary sheath around the vein, which is free to expand during times of increased blood flow.

## Brachial Plexus

Five roots contribute to the formation of the plexus for the upper limb (Fig. 2.13). They are the fibers that remain in the anterior rami of C5, 6, 7, 8, and T1 after these have given their segmental supply to the prevertebral and scalene muscles. They are to divide into anterior and posterior divisions to supply the flexor and extensor compartments respectively (p. 23), but before doing so, they unite to form three trunks in the following manner. Of the five roots of the plexus, the upper two unite to form the upper trunk, the lower two unite to form the lower trunk, and the central root runs on as the middle trunk. The five roots lie behind the scalenus anterior muscle and emerge between it and scalenus medius to form the trunks which cross the lower part of the posterior triangle of the neck. Each of the three trunks divides into an anterior and a posterior division behind the clavicle. Here, at the outer border of the first rib, the upper two anterior divisions unite to form the lateral cord, the anterior division of the lower trunk runs on as the medial cord, while all three posterior divisions unite to form the posterior cord. These three cords enter the axilla above the first part of the artery, approach and embrace its second part, and give off their branches around its third part.

It is important to appreciate the situation of the constituents of the plexus, i.e., roots between scalene muscles, trunks in the triangle, divisions behind the clavicle, and cords in the axilla. The various branches of the plexus (Fig. 2.14) are derived from the roots, trunks, and cords; there is none from the divisions. The roots and trunks with their branches form the supraclavicular part of the plexus, with the cords and their branches forming the infraclavicular part.

When the basic pattern has been learned, it is a simple matter to put in the branches of the plexus. They consist of 3 branches from the roots and 3, 5, and 5 from the lateral, medial, and posterior cords respectively. The only exception to the 3, 5, 5 rule is in the branch from the trunks. It is only one, the suprascapular nerve, from the upper trunk, in the posterior triangle. Everywhere else in the plexus, the number of branches follows the 3, 5, 5 pattern (Fig. 2.13).

### Branches from the Roots

Three in number, i.e., the dorsal scapular nerve, the nerve to subclavius, and the long thoracic nerve, they arise successively from C5, C5, 6, and C5, 6, 7, and pass downwards behind, in front of, and behind the roots in that order.

The dorsal scapular nerve (nerve to the rhomboids) arises from the posterior aspect of C5, enters scalenus medius, appears at its posterior border, and courses downwards beneath levator scapulae, lying on serratus posterior superior. It is accompanied by the dorsal scapular vessels. It supplies both rhomboids on their deep surfaces and usually gives a branch to levator scapulae (Fig. 2.6).

The nerve to subclavius arises from the roots of C5 and 6 just as they combine to form the upper trunk (and is often classified as arising from the upper trunk). It passes down in front of the trunks and the subclavian vessels to enter the posterior surface of subclavius. It may carry some aberrant phrenic nerve fibers (p. 427).

The long thoracic nerve (nerve to serratus anterior) arises from the posterior aspects of C5, 6, and 7. Branches of C5 and 6 enter scalenus medius, unite in the muscle, emerge as a single trunk from its lateral border and pass down into the axilla. On the surface of serratus anterior (the medial wall of the axilla), this is joined by the branch from C7 which has descended in front of scalenus medius (Fig. 2.7). The nerve passes down posterior to the midaxillary line and supplies serratus anterior muscle segmentally (p. 60 and Fig. 2.15).

### Branch from the Trunks

The solitary branch from the trunks (unless the nerve to subclavius is also considered to arise from the upper trunk) is the suprascapular nerve, which arises from the upper trunk in the lower part of the posterior triangle. It can be seen above the clavicle as a large nerve leaving the upper trunk (Fig. 6.4, p. 430) and passing back and laterally to disappear beneath the border of trapezius. It passes through the suprascapular foramen (beneath the transverse scapular ligament) and supplies supraspinatus, descends lateral to the scapular spine with the suprascapular vessels and supplies infraspinatus and gives a twig to the shoulder joint.

### Branches from the Lateral Cord

The lateral pectoral nerve pierces the clavipectoral fascia to supply pectoralis major with fibers from C5, 6, and 7 (Fig. 2.12). It communicates across the axillary artery with the medial pectoral nerve and through this communication supplies pectoralis minor. It has no cutaneous branch.

The musculocutaneous nerve leaves the lateral cord, runs obliquely downwards and sinks into coracobrachialis (Fig. 2.12), giving a twig of supply to it (C5, 6) before passing through the muscle. Lower down, it supplies biceps and brachialis and becomes the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm.

The lateral root of the median nerve is the continuation of the lateral cord (C5, 6, 7). It is joined by the medial root of the median nerve (from the medial cord, C8 and T1); the two roots embrace the artery (Fig. 2.12) and, when the arm is pulled down to depress the shoulder, may, in some cases, compress the vessel. Do not confuse the roots of the plexus with the roots of the median nerve.

### Branches from the Medial Cord

Five in number, they are the medial pectoral, medial head of the median nerve, ulnar nerve, and the two cutaneous nerves, to the arm and forearm respectively.

The medial pectoral nerve arises from the medial cord (C8, T1) behind the axillary artery and enters the deep surface of pectoralis minor, giving a branch of supply before doing so, perforates the muscle (Fig. 2.12) and enters the pectoralis major, in which it ends by supplying the lower costal fibers. It is joined by a communication from the lateral pectoral nerve which passes across the axillary artery. Like the lateral pectoral nerve, it has no cutaneous branch.

The medial root of the median nerve is the continuation of the medial cord, with fibers from C8 and T1, and it crosses the axillary artery to join the lateral root (Fig. 2.12).

The medial cutaneous nerve of the arm (C8, T1) is the smallest and most medial of all the branches. It runs down on the medial side of the axillary vein and supplies skin over the front and medial side of the upper arm.

The medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm (C8, T1) is a large nerve which runs down between the artery and vein in front of the ulnar nerve (Fig. 2.12) and supplies skin over the lower part of the arm and the medial side of the forearm.

The ulnar nerve is the largest branch of the medial cord (C7, 8, T1). It runs down between the artery and vein behind the medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm (Fig. 2.12), and is the most posterior of the structures which run down the medial side of the flexor compartment of the arm. It receives its C7 fibers as a branch from the lateral cord in over 95%; these fibers are given off in the forearm as the motor branch to flexor carpi ulnaris (p. 90). The ulnar nerve eventually supplies most of the small muscles of the hand (p. 114).

### Branches from the Posterior Cord

Five in number, they are the upper subscapular, thoracodorsal nerve (nerve to latissimus dorsi), lower subscapular, axillary (circumflex), and radial nerves (Fig. 2.15).

The upper subscapular nerve is a small nerve (C5, 6) which enters the upper part of subscapularis (Fig. 2.15).

The thoracodorsal nerve (nerve to latissimus dorsi C6, 7, 8) is a large nerve which runs down the posterior axillary wall, crosses the lower border of teres major and enters the deep surface of latissimus dorsi, well forward near the border of the muscle (Fig. 2.15). It comes from high up behind the subscapular artery, but as it descends to enter the muscle it lies in front of the artery, at this level now called the thoracodorsal artery. It is thrown into prominence in the position of lateral rotation and abduction of the humerus and is thus in danger in operations on the lower axilla.

The lower subscapular nerve (C5, 6) is larger than the upper subscapular and supplies the lower part of the subscapularis (Fig. 2.15). It gives a separate twig to teres major, which runs in the angle between the subscapular and circumflex scapular arteries.

The axillary nerve (formerly the circumflex nerve) is one of the two large terminal branches of the posterior cord (the other is the radial nerve). The axillary nerve (C5, 6) supplies nothing in the axilla despite its name having been changed from circumflex to axillary. From its origin, which is higher than usually imagined (Fig. 2.15), it passes backwards between subscapularis and teres major, lateral to the long head of triceps, i.e., through the quadrangular space. Here it lies in contact with the surgical neck of the humerus, just below the capsule of the shoulder joint, with the posterior circumflex humeral vessels below it. Having given a branch to the shoulder joint, it divides into anterior and posterior branches. The anterior branch winds round behind the humerus in contact with the periosteum and enters the deep surface of the deltoid to supply it (p. 73); a few terminal twigs pierce the muscle and reach the skin. The posterior branch gives off the motor nerve to teres minor, then winds around the posterior border of deltoid and becomes cutaneous. It is here called the upper lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm. It supplies a few of the posterior fibers of deltoid.

The radial nerve (C5, 6, 7, 8, T1) is the continuation of the posterior cord, and is the largest branch of the whole plexus. It crosses the lower border of the posterior axillary wall, lying on the glistening tendon of latissimus dorsi (Fig. 2.15). It passes out of sight through the triangular space below the lower border of teres major, between the long head of triceps and the humerus (Figs 2.10 and 2.16). Before disappearing, it gives nerves to supply to the long head of triceps, to the medial head by a nerve which accompanies the ulnar nerve along the medial side of the arm, and a cutaneous branch which supplies the skin along the posterior surface of the upper arm (the posterior cutaneous nerve of the arm). The radial nerve is important as the nerve of the extensor compartment of the forearm (p. 83).

### Axillary Lymph Nodes

Contained in the fibrofatty tissue of the axilla are many scattered lymph nodes. The average number is about 35, but there may be over 50. They are usually described as lying in the following groups:

1.  An anterior or pectoral group, lying along the medial wall of the axilla with the lateral thoracic artery, at the lower border of pectoralis minor. They receive from the upper half of the trunk anteriorly and from the major part of the breast.
2.  A posterior or subscapular group, lying along the medial wall of the axilla in the posterior part, i.e., along the subscapular artery. They receive from the upper half of the trunk posteriorly, and from the axillary tail of the breast.
3.  A lateral group, lying along the medial side of the axillary vein. They receive from the upper limb.
4.  A central group, lying in the fat of the axilla and receiving lymph from the above groups.
5.  An apical group, lying in the apex of the axilla, receives from all the groups named above. The apical group drains by the subclavian lymph trunk through the apex of the axilla into supraclavicular nodes lying in the lower part of the posterior triangle of the neck. These drain into the thoracic duct or the right lymphatic trunk.

## Breast

The adult female breast or mammary gland lies in the subcutaneous tissue (superficial fascia) of the anterior thoracic wall. Despite individual variations in size, the extent of the base of the breast is fairly constant: from near the midline to near the midaxillary line, and from the second to the sixth ribs. It overlies pectoralis major, overlapping onto serratus anterior and to a small part of the rectus sheath and external oblique muscle. A small part of the upper outer quadrant may extend laterally to form the axillary tail (but not always present); it lies in the medial wall of the axilla and may be a discrete mass poorly connected with the duct system. Usually it lies in the subcutaneous fat, which is condensed around it; rarely it may penetrate the deep fascia of the axillary floor and so lie adjacent to some axillary lymph nodes.

Some 15-20 lactiferous ducts converge in a radial direction to open on the nipple, the projection just below the center of the breast which is surrounded by an area of pigmented skin, the areola. Some large sebaceous glands under the areola (areolar glands) may form small elevations (tubercles of Montgomery).

Behind the breast, the superficial fascia (the upward continuation of the membranous layer of superficial abdominal fascia of Scarpa) is condensed to form a posterior capsule. Strands of fibrous tissue (forming the suspensory ligaments of Cooper) connect the dermis of the overlying skin to this fascia, and help to maintain the protuberance of the young breast; with the atrophy of age, they allow the breast to become pendulous, and when contracted by carcinoma, they cause pitting of the skin. Between the capsule and the fascia over pectoralis major is the retromammary space, traversed by lymph vessels and some blood vessels but relatively avascular. It is the space into which breast prostheses are usually inserted, and access to it is most commonly through an incision above and parallel to the submammary skin crease.

### Blood Supply

This is derived mainly from the lateral thoracic artery by branches that curl around the border of pectoralis major and by other branches that pierce the muscle. The internal thoracic artery also sends branches through the intercostal spaces beside the sternum; those of the second and third spaces are the largest. Similar but small perforating branches arise from the intercostal arteries; as mentioned above, the space superficial to pectoralis major is relatively bloodless. Pectoral branches of the thoracoacromial artery supply the upper part of the breast. The various supplying vessels form an anastomosing network. Venous drainage is mainly by deep veins that run with the main arteries to internal thoracic and axillary veins. Some drainage to posterior intercostal veins provides an important link to vertebral veins (p. 543) and hence a pathway for metastatic spread to bone. Superficial veins may anastomose across the midline (though not all authorities subscribe to this suggestion).

### Lymph Drainage

From numerous lymphatic capillaries in the breast substance and the overlying skin, lymph from the lateral part of the breast (upper and lower outer quadrants) drains to axillary and infraclavicular nodes (p. 70), while from the medial part (upper and lower inner quadrants) it drains through the intercostal spaces into internal thoracic (parasternal) nodes. This is what might be expected - the lateral part draining laterally and the medial part medially, but it is important to note that there can be lymph flow between the lateral and medial parts of the breast and vice versa, possibly aided by the pressure of clothing or the examiner's hand. Some nodes may be embedded within breast tissue in the upper outer quadrant, and some may lie between pectoralis major and minor. There are no valves in the intramammary channels. Most lymph drains to the axilla; some of the internal thoracic nodes, which are mainly in the first three interspaces within 3 cm of the sternal margin, are very small and may easily be missed. Superficial lymphatics may cross the midline (like veins, see above, but again some authorities deny this). The old concept that the skin and subareolar regions drained separately from the breast parenchyma is no longer tenable. But other pathways become possible, especially when the more usual channels have become obstructed, and lymph may then pass to the opposite breast, to cervical nodes, to the peritoneal cavity and liver through the diaphragm or through the rectus sheath, or even to inguinal nodes via the anterior abdominal wall.

### Nerve Supply

The overlying skin is supplied by the cutaneous branches of intercostal nerves T4 to T6. Sympathetic fibers supply the blood vessels and glands, but the control of lactation is hormonal.

### Structure

The resting (non-lactating) breast consists mostly of fibrous and fatty tissue; variations in size are due to variations in fat content, not glandular tissue which is very sparse and is little more than a system of blind-ending ducts. The areolar glands are typical sebaceous glands. Fibrous septa (the largest of which are the suspensory ligaments, see above) divide the breast into irregular lobules from which the lactiferous ducts converge to open on the summit of the nipple, each duct having a dilated sinus just below the nipple. Prior to lactation, alveoli bud off from the smaller ducts into the surrounding tissue and the organ usually enlarges significantly, and more so in preparation for lactation. After lactation and after the menopause, there is resorption of glandular and other tissues.

The breast is a modified apocrine sweat gland (p. 2) and begins to develop as early as the fourth week as a downgrowth from a thickened mammary ridge (milk line) of ectoderm along a line from the axilla to the inguinal region. Supernumerary nipples or even glands proper may form at lower levels on this line.

The extensive removal of the breast and adjacent tissues for carcinoma so common in earlier decades has now given place in many cases to local excision supplemented by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. If simple mastectomy is required, the breast is stripped off the pectoralis fascia and adjacent muscles, together with axillary fat and lymph nodes. For more radical procedures, one or both pectoral muscles can be removed as well. In axillary dissections, damage to the long thoracic and thoracodorsal nerves (as well as to the main branches of the brachial plexus) must be avoided, but the intercostobrachial nerve can be cut when clearing fat and lymph nodes. If both pectoral muscles are being removed, the pectoral nerves can also be cut, but if pectoralis major remains, the lateral pectoral nerve must be preserved so that at least part of the muscle retains a nerve supply.

## Muscles of the Shoulder

A group of six muscles of the shoulder converge from the scapula onto the humerus and surround the shoulder joint: deltoid, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, teres major, and subscapularis. Three of them (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor) extend from the posterior surface of the blade of the scapula to be inserted into the three impressions on the greater tuberosity of the humerus. Subscapularis passes from the thoracic surface of the scapula to the lesser tuberosity, and teres major from the inferior angle of the scapula to the shaft of the humerus. All these muscles lie hidden, for the most part, under deltoid and trapezius. Subscapularis and teres major have already been described (p. 63).

### Supraspinatus

The muscle fills snugly the whole of the supraspinous fossa of the scapula (Fig. 2.16). It arises from the medial three-fourths of the fossa and from the upper surface of the scapular spine. It is bipennate, an arrangement that gives this bulky muscle great force of pull. A bursa separates it from the lateral fourth of the fossa. The tendon develops deep to the muscle as it crosses the superior part of the capsule of the shoulder joint; the two become blended together, to the great advantage of the capsule. The tendon passes on to be inserted into the smooth facet on the upper part of the greater tuberosity (Fig. 2.60).

**Nerve supply.** By the suprascapular nerve (C5, 6), from the upper trunk of the brachial plexus, passing beneath the superficial transverse scapular ligament which bridges the suprascapular notch, and supplying the muscle by two branches.

**Action.** The muscle is of primary importance in bracing the head of the humerus to the glenoid cavity, to give stability during the action of other muscles, especially the deltoid, which it assists in abduction at the shoulder joint (p. 77).

**Test.** The arm is abducted against resistance and the muscle palpated (deep to trapezius) above the scapular spine.

### Infraspinatus

The muscle arises from beneath a dense fascia (see below) from the medial three-fourths of the infraspinous fossa (Fig. 2.16). Fibrous intramuscular septa give added attachment to the multipennate fibers, which converge to slide freely over the bare area of the scapula at its lateral angle. A bursa lies between the two and it sometimes communicates with the shoulder joint. Here tendon replaces the muscle fibers, and is blended with the capsule of the shoulder joint, greatly increasing its strength. The tendon is inserted into the smooth area on the central facet of the greater tuberosity of the humerus (Fig. 2.60), between supraspinatus above and teres minor below.

**Nerve supply.** By the suprascapular nerve (C5, 6) from the upper trunk of the brachial plexus. After giving branches to supraspinatus (see above), the nerve passes around the lateral border of the scapular spine and enters the infraspinous fossa to give two branches to the muscle.

**Action.** Apart from acting to brace the head of the humerus against the glenoid cavity, giving stability to the joint in movements of the peripheral parts of the limb, the muscle is also a powerful lateral rotator of the humerus.

**Test.** With the elbow flexed and held into the side, the forearm is moved outwards against resistance. The muscle is palpated (deep to trapezius) below the scapular spine and is usually visible.

### Teres Minor

The muscle is completely hidden beneath the deltoid. It arises from an elongated oval area at the axillary border of the scapula. It passes upwards and laterally, edge to edge with the lower border of infraspinatus (Fig. 2.16), to the lowest facet on the greater tuberosity of the humerus and to a thumb's breadth of bone below this. It passes behind the origin of the long head of triceps. At the lower border, it lies edge to edge with teres major at its origin, but the latter muscle leaves it by passing forward in front of the long head of triceps (Fig. 2.16).

**Action.** It assists the other small muscles around the head of the humerus in steadying the shoulder joint in movements of peripheral parts of the limb. More specifically, it can act as a lateral rotator and weak adductor of the humerus. With the teres major, it holds down the head of the humerus against the upward pull of the deltoid during abduction of the shoulder (Fig. 2.20).

### Infraspinatus Fascia

The infraspinatus and teres minor muscles lie together beneath a very strong membrane which is firmly attached to bone at the margins of these muscles. It is attached above to the lower border of the scapular spine beneath the deltoid muscle, and medially along the vertebral border of the scapula. It is attached to the axillary border of the scapula along the sinuous ridge that can be seen running down from the infraglenoid tubercle. Examine a scapula and note that this ridge runs back to the dorsal surface of the bone above the origin of teres major. The latter muscle does not lie beneath the fascia (Fig. 2.5).

The importance of the infraspinatus fascia is not confined to its value as a landmark in surgical exposures of this region, but lies in the fact that in fracture of the blade of the scapula, the resulting hematoma is confined beneath the fascia. A large rounded swelling that is limited to the margins of the bone is diagnostic of fracture.

### Deltoid

This powerful muscle arises from a long strip of bone and converges triangularly to its insertion on the deltoid tuberosity. It covers the shoulder joint like a cape (Fig. 2.1) and its convex shape is due to the underlying upper end of the humerus. The anterior and posterior fibers are long, and in parallel bundles. The intermediate, or acromial fibers are multipennate.

The muscle arises from the anterior border and upper surface of the flattened lateral one-third of the clavicle, from the whole of the lateral border of the acromion and from the inferior lip of the crest of the scapular spine as far medially as the deltoid tubercle. On the lateral border of the acromion, four ridges may be seen; from them four fibrous septa pass down into the muscle. The deltoid tuberosity on the humerus is U-shaped, with a central vertical ridge. From the ridge and limbs of the U, three fibrous septa pass upwards between the four septa from the acromion. The spaces between the septa are filled with a fleshy mass of oblique muscle fibers which are attached to contiguous septa. The multipennate center of the deltoid so formed has a diminished range of contraction, but a correspondingly increased force of pull. The anterior and posterior fibers, arising from the clavicle and the scapular spine, are not multipennate. They converge on the limbs of the U-shaped deltoid tuberosity of the humerus. Their range of movement is greater but the force of their pull is less than that of the multipennate central portion of the muscle.

**Nerve supply.** By the axillary nerve (C5, 6) from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus. The nerve runs transversely round the back and lateral side of the surgical neck of the humerus giving off numerous branches that enter the muscle in radial directions; splitting the muscle vertically does not damage the nerve supply. The surface marking of the nerve is along a transverse line about 5 cm below the tip of the acromion.

**Action.** Working with supraspinatus, deltoid abducts the arm (p. 77). It is the main abductor, most of this work being done by the multipennate acromial fibers. The anterior and posterior fibers act like guy ropes to steady the arm in the abducted position. The anterior fibers acting alone assist pectoralis major in flexing and medially rotating the arm; the posterior fibers assist latissimus dorsi in extending the arm and act as a lateral rotator (acting in adduction to counteract the medial rotation of pectoralis major and latissimus).

In tetraplegia, the posterior third of deltoid can be transferred to triceps to produce elbow extension.

**Test.** The arm is abducted against resistance and the muscle is seen and felt.

**Intramuscular injection.** The site for intramuscular injection into deltoid is on the lateral side of the bulge of the shoulder, no more than 4 cm below the lower border of the acromion; the axillary nerve curls forwards round the back of the humerus 5-6 cm below the acromion.

### Scapular Anastomosis

The transverse cervical artery from the subclavian, via the thyrocervical trunk or sometimes directly, has a deep or descending branch (often called the dorsal scapular artery - see p. 444) which accompanies the dorsal scapular nerve. It runs down the vertebral border of the scapula to its inferior angle (Fig. 2.17). The suprascapular artery from the subclavian, usually the first part (thyrocervical trunk in common with the transverse cervical) but occasionally the third part, crosses over the superficial transverse scapular ligament, passes through the supraspinous fossa, turns around the lateral border of the spine of the scapula and supplies the infraspinous fossa as far as the inferior angle. The subscapular artery, branching from the third part of the axillary, supplies the subscapularis muscle in the subscapular fossa as far as the inferior angle. Its circumflex scapular branch enters the infraspinous fossa on the dorsal surface of the bone. All the vessels anastomose, thus connecting the first part of the subclavian with the third part of the axillary artery. The companion veins form corresponding anastomoses.

## Shoulder Joint

In all tetrapods, there is a scapula which is dorsal and a coracoid which is ventral. The humerus always articulates at the junction of the two elements. In the human shoulder, scapula and coracoid articulate with each other across the joint line (Fig. 2.9). The presence of an epiphyseal cartilage across a joint line is beneficial in that it facilitates adjustment of the joint surfaces during growth of the bone ends (as at the shoulder, elbow, and hip).

The shoulder joint is a synovial joint of the ball and socket variety. There is a 4 to 1 disproportion between the large round head of the humerus and the small shallow glenoid cavity. The glenoid labrum, a ring of fibrocartilage attached to the margins of the glenoid cavity, deepens slightly but effectively the depression of the glenoid fossa (Fig. 2.9).

The capsule of the joint is attached to the scapula beyond the supraglenoid tubercle and the margins of the labrum. It is attached to the humerus around the articular margins of the head (i.e., the anatomical neck) except inferiorly, where its attachment is to the surgical neck of the humerus a finger's breadth below the articular margin (Fig. 2.18A). At the upper end of the intertubercular groove, the capsule bridges the gap between the greater and lesser tuberosities, being here named the transverse humeral ligament. A gap in the anterior part of the capsule allows communication between the synovial membrane and the subscapularis bursa (Figs 2.11 and 2.18). A similar gap is sometimes present posteriorly, allowing communication with the infraspinatus bursa. The fibers of the capsule all run horizontally between the scapula and humerus. The capsule is thick and strong but it is very lax, a necessity in a joint so mobile as this. Near the humerus, the capsule is greatly thickened by fusion of the tendons of the short scapular muscles. The long tendon of biceps is intracapsular.

The synovial membrane is attached around the glenoid labrum and lines the capsule. It is attached to the articular margin of the head of the humerus and covers the bare area of the surgical neck that lies within the capsule at the upper end of the shaft. It herniates through the hole in the front of the capsule to communicate with the subscapularis bursa and sometimes it communicates with the infraspinatus bursa. It invests the long head of biceps in a tubular sleeve that is reflected back along the tendon to the transverse ligament and adjoining floor of the intertubercular groove. The synovial sleeve glides to and fro with the long tendon of biceps during abduction-adduction of the shoulder, as shown in Figure 2.18A and B.

The glenohumeral ligaments are scarcely worthy of mention, being slight thickenings above and below the opening into the subscapularis bursa in the anterior part of the capsule. They are visible only from within the joint cavity.

The coracohumeral ligament is quite strong. It runs from the under surface of the coracoid process laterally across the capsule, to which it becomes attached at the margin of the greater tuberosity, and along the transverse ligament.

From the medial border of the acromion, in front of the acromioclavicular articulation, a strong flat triangular band, the coracoacromial ligament, fans out to the lateral border of the coracoid process (Fig. 2.18). It lies above the head of the humerus and serves to increase the surface upon which the head of the humerus may be supported. It is separated from the rotator cuff by the subacromial bursa (Fig. 2.18).

The subacromial (subdeltoid) bursa is a large bursa which lies under the coracoacromial ligament, to which its upper layer is attached. Its lower layer is attached to the tendon of supraspinatus. It extends beyond the lateral border of the acromion with the arm at the side, but is rolled inwards under the acromion when the arm is abducted. Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus beneath the deltoid muscle which disappears when the arm is abducted indicates subacromial bursitis. Tearing the supraspinatus tendon brings the bursa into communication with the shoulder joint cavity, but in the normal shoulder, the bursa never communicates with the joint.

**Nerve supply.** By branches from the axillary, musculocutaneous, and suprascapular nerves (Hilton's law, p. 12).

The shoulder joint, thus far described, is seen to be a very unstable structure. The head of the humerus is much larger than the glenoid cavity (Fig. 2.19), and the joint capsule, though strong, is very lax. True it is that the concavity of the glenoid cavity, deepened by the labrum, is a significant stabilizing factor. But this is only because the short scapular muscles hold the head in close apposition. Fracture of the labrum results in dislocation. Stability is increased by the coracoacromial arch, the fusion of tendons of scapular muscles with the capsule of the joint, and the muscles attaching the humerus to the pectoral girdle.

Upward displacement of the head of the humerus is prevented by the overhanging coracoid and acromion processes and the coracoacromial ligament that bridges them. The whole constitutes the coracoacromial arch and, lubricated by the subacromial bursa, functions mechanically as an articular surface of the shoulder joint. The arch is very strong. Upward thrust on the humerus will never fracture the arch; the clavicle or the humerus itself will fracture first.

The tendons of subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor are not only attached very near the joint but actually in part fuse with the lateral part of the capsule. This is an indispensable factor in adding stability to the joint. The fused mass of tendon and lateral part of capsule is known surgically as the rotator cuff. The rotator cuff prevents the lax capsule and its lining synovial membrane from being nipped. There is no cuff inferiorly, and here the capsule is attached well below the articular margin to prevent its being nipped. Note that supraspinatus does not have any rotatory action on the humerus, although the other three muscles do.

The muscles attaching the humerus to the pectoral girdle all assist by their tonus in maintaining the stability of the joint. Especially active in this respect are the long heads of biceps and triceps.

The long head of biceps, arising from the supraglenoid tubercle, sinks in through the capsule of the embryonic joint and is intracapsular in the mature joint. It leaves the capsule beneath the transverse ligament across the upper part of the intertubercular groove. The tendon acts as a strong support over the head of the humerus.

The long head of triceps is of importance during abduction of the joint for, in this position, it lies immediately beneath the head of the humerus at the lowest part of the joint. This is the weakest part of the joint; the long head of triceps is thus of very great importance in giving stability to the abducted humerus.

### Movements

The articular surface of the head of the humerus is four times the area of the glenoid cavity; thus there is considerable freedom for a variety of movements. Movements at the joint are accompanied by movements of the scapula on the thoracic wall and by consequential movements of the clavicle.

These various movements of the shoulder joint itself, however, can be understood only if each is analyzed into its constituent parts. These basic movements are only three: (1) flexion and extension, (2) adduction and abduction, and (3) rotation. Note that circumduction is merely a rhythmical combination in orderly sequence of flexion, abduction, extension, and adduction (or the reverse), and for purposes of analysis it is not an elementary movement.

It is of clinical value to appreciate the fact that the medial epicondyle of the humerus faces in the same direction as the articular surface of the head. Note that this is not exactly medial, but rather medial and somewhat backwards. The glenoid cavity does not face exactly laterally, but peeps forward a little around the convexity of the thoracic wall, and the articular surface on the head of the humerus looks back towards it. The purist may claim that flexion and extension should be described as movements in the plane of the joint cavity, which is oblique to the sagittal plane, and that abduction and adduction should be defined as movements in a plane at right angles to this, which is oblique to the coronal plane. But for purposes of analysis of these movements, the difference is negligible.

Examine the humerus and scapula. Any of the basic movements under review is limited in its range (apart from tension in ligaments or muscles) by the available articular surface on the head of the humerus. When the glenoid cavity and humeral head lie margin to margin, further movement is impossible without dislocation of the joint.

With the arm at the side (Fig. 2.19A), adduction is very limited in range, not only by compression of soft parts but also because very little surface of the humerus is available. Abduction from this position is limited to about 90°. Fixation here is not due to bony interlocking between the greater tuberosity and acromion, but to the fact that no further articular surface is available on the humerus (Fig. 2.19B). Further abduction in this position can only result in dislocation of the head of the humerus. The available free surface of the humeral head lies below the joint. If this free surface is now put above the joint by lateral rotation of the humerus (Fig. 2.19C), further abduction is made possible (Fig. 2.19D). Note that this final position of full abduction in lateral rotation (Fig. 2.19D), reached through the coronal plane, can be achieved in the sagittal plane by a simple pendulum movement of the humerus, carrying the normal forward swing of flexion straight up into full abduction. Flexion is free and direct from A to D (Fig. 2.19) with no rotation of the humerus. Abduction from A to D is possible only with lateral rotation of the humerus. In each case, the final position of the humerus is the same. In 180° of abduction, about 120° takes place at the shoulder joint and 60° is provided by scapular rotation, i.e., over the whole range the ratio of shoulder joint to scapular movement is 2 to 1. But for the first 30° or so, there is negligible scapular movement which only becomes noticeable beyond this.

Rotation of the humerus can be performed, about its long axis, in any position. It is limited by the extent of the articular surface on the humerus, and by simultaneous tension in the appropriate part of the capsule. About 90° of lateral rotation is normal and the same amount for medial rotation, although when the arm is hanging by the side with the elbow flexed, medial rotation appears to be limited to 70° by contact with the body wall; if the humerus is abducted to a right angle, the full 90° can be obtained.

Abduction in the coronal plane is produced by deltoid assisted by supraspinatus. It is usually considered that supraspinatus initiates abduction, with the acromial fibers of deltoid adding force after the movement has begun; both muscles then act together. The pull of supraspinatus appears to cause the head of the humerus to move down slightly as the greater tuberosity is pulled upwards and medially (Fig. 2.20A). Supraspinatus is not usually considered capable by itself of producing the full range of glenohumeral movement, but with deltoid completely paralyzed, rare cases have been recorded when it can. The downward pull on the head of the humerus by subscapularis, teres major and minor, and infraspinatus acts as a stabilizing couple against the upward pull of the deltoid (Fig. 2.20B).

Adduction is produced by the short scapular muscles (except supraspinatus) when deltoid relaxes, and the movement is much strengthened by contraction of the great muscles of the axillary walls, pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi.

Flexion is produced by the clavicular head of pectoralis major and the anterior fibers of deltoid, assisted by coracobrachialis and biceps. From full extension, the sternocostal head of pectoralis major is also involved. Extension is produced by latissimus dorsi, the posterior fibers of deltoid, and the long head of triceps.

Rotation is produced chiefly by the short scapular muscles: infraspinatus and teres minor for lateral rotation, subscapularis and teres major for medial rotation.

As a test for lateral rotation, put the hand behind the head, comparing the two limbs. For medial rotation, put the hand on the back between the scapulae.

**Surgical approach.** The joint can be exposed from the front or back. From the front, the deltopectoral groove is opened up, ligating tributaries of the cephalic vein, and the tip of the coracoid process is detached and turned medially with coracobrachialis and the short head of biceps still attached, taking care not to damage the musculocutaneous nerve entering coracobrachialis. Subscapularis is stretched by laterally rotating the humerus and then divided to expose the joint capsule. The anterior circumflex humeral vessels are a guide to the lateral (lower) border of the muscle.

From the back, deltoid is detached from the spine of the scapula and acromion and reflected laterally to allow infraspinatus and teres minor to be cut to expose the capsule. The axillary nerve and posterior circumflex humeral vessels must not be damaged when reflecting deltoid.

Injection or aspiration of the joint can be carried out from the side below the acromion, from the back below the junction of the acromion with the spine and in the direction of the coracoid process, or from the front with the needle passing through the deltopectoral groove and then below and medial to the tip of the coracoid process, through the coracobrachialis-biceps origin and subscapularis.

## Muscles of the Arm

Part of the anterior or flexor compartment in both the arm and the thigh is occupied by the adductor musculature. In the thigh, this is differentiated into adductors longus, brevis, and that part of magnus innervated from the obturator nerve (p. 160). In the arm, the adductor musculature is represented by the rather insignificant coracobrachialis muscle; the function of adduction has been taken over by the well-developed muscles in the anterior and posterior axillary walls. The nerve of the flexor compartment is the musculocutaneous.

### Coracobrachialis

Functionally unimportant, the muscle nevertheless shows several interesting morphological and anatomical characteristics. It is the counterpart in the arm of the adductors (longus, brevis, magnus) of the thigh. It arises from the apex of the coracoid process, where it is fused with the medial side of the short head of biceps. The tendon is continued into a muscular belly of varying development which is inserted into the medial border of the humerus. The lower extent of the insertion is marked by the nutrient foramen of the humerus, for the nutrient branch of the brachial artery runs along the medial intermuscular septum to enter the bone.

The musculocutaneous nerve passes through the muscle. This is explained in terms of comparative anatomy. In some animals, the muscle has three heads; in man, two have fused, trapping the nerve between them, and the third part has become suppressed. The occasional supratrochlear spur (on the anteromedial aspect of the lower humerus) may be continuous with a ligament (of Struthers, Fig. 2.21) which passes to the medial epicondyle and represents the remains of the third head. The median nerve or brachial artery or both may run beneath it and be subject to compression.

**Nerve supply.** By the musculocutaneous nerve (C5, 6). The main trunk of the nerve passes through the muscle, first giving off its branch of supply (Fig. 2.12).

**Action.** Compared to the morphological interest of this muscle, its action is negligible. It is a weak flexor and adductor of the shoulder joint, the main adductors of which are pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi.

### Biceps Brachii

The long head of this muscle arises from the supraglenoid tubercle and adjoining part of the glenoid labrum of the scapula (Fig. 2.9). The rounded tendon passes through the synovial cavity of the shoulder joint, surrounded by synovial membrane, and emerges beneath the transverse ligament at the upper end of the intertubercular groove. The membrane pouts out below the ligament to an extent which varies with the position of the arm, being greatest in full abduction (Fig. 2.18). The range of mobility of the tendon under the transverse ligament between full adduction and abduction of the shoulder joint is 6 cm. The long tendon develops outside the capsule, then sinks through it, then hangs on a mesotendon which subsequently breaks down. This embryological progression may become arrested at any stage.

The short head arises from the apex of the coracoid process to the lateral side of coracobrachialis. The tendinous origin of each head expands into a fleshy belly; the two bellies lie side by side, loosely connected by areolar tissue, but do not merge until just above the elbow joint, below the main convexity of the muscle belly. The tendon at the lower end, flat from side to side, lies across the elbow joint and converges into a flattened cord which rotates (anterior surface turning laterally) as it passes through the cubital fossa to its insertion into the posterior border of the tuberosity of the radius (Fig. 2.27). A bursa separates the tendon from the anterior part of the tuberosity. From the medial border of the tendon, at the level of the elbow joint, the bicipital aponeurosis (Fig. 2.30) is inserted by way of the deep fascia of the forearm into the subcutaneous border of the upper end of the ulna. This aponeurosis has a sharp concave upper margin which can be felt tensed when the supinated forearm is flexed to a right angle. The main tendon, sliding in and out of the cubital fossa during pronation and supination, has a total range of movement of 6 cm.

**Action.** Biceps acts on three joints: shoulder, elbow, and proximal radioulnar. If the elbow is extended, the muscle is a simple flexor thereof, but in any position of the elbow short of full extension, the biceps is a powerful supinator of the forearm, triceps contracting to prevent flexion at the elbow joint. In full supination, the bicipital aponeurosis is pulled taut and biceps then pulls on both bones of the forearm to flex the elbow. Unopposed by triceps, the biceps, while supinating the forearm, flexes the elbow and shoulder joints. It puts in the corkscrew then pulls out the cork. The long head helps to stabilize the shoulder joint because its tendon of origin runs over the top of the head of the humerus. If deltoid is paralyzed, biceps may help in abduction.

### Brachialis

The muscle arises from the front of the lower two-thirds of the humerus and the medial intermuscular septum. Its upper fibers clasp the deltoid insertion; some fibers arise from the lower part of the radial groove. The broad muscle flattens to cover the anterior part of the elbow joint (with some fibers attaching to the front of the capsule) and is inserted by mixed tendon and muscle fibers into the coronoid process and tuberosity of the ulna (Fig. 2.31).

**Nerve supply.** By the musculocutaneous nerve (C5, 6). Some of the lateral part of the muscle is innervated by a branch of the radial nerve, an indication that it was developed in the extensor compartment of the fetal limb (p. 23).

**Action.** Principally a flexor of the elbow joint, the muscle, together with biceps, is used just as frequently as an extensor of the elbow, paying out rope against gravity. It picks up the drink and puts down the empty glass. Some fibers pull the capsule of the elbow joint upwards and prevent entrapment of the capsule between the humerus and ulna.

### Medial Intermuscular Septum

This septum extends along the medial supracondylar line behind the coracobrachialis insertion and fades out above, between that muscle and the long head of triceps. It gives origin to the most medial fibers of brachialis and the medial head of triceps, and is pierced by the ulnar nerve and ulnar collateral artery.

### Lateral Intermuscular Septum

This extends along the lateral supracondylar line and fades out behind the insertion of deltoid. Both brachioradialis and extensor carpi radialis longus extend out from the humerus to gain attachment to the septum in front, and posteriorly the medial head of triceps arises from it. It is pierced by the radial nerve and profunda brachii artery (anterior descending branch).

## Nerves and Vessels of the Arm

The neurovascular bundle from the axilla passes into the flexor compartment of the arm. Some branches (circumflex vessels and axillary nerve) are given to the extensor compartment in the axilla, which they leave through the quadrangular space. In the upper part of the arm, the radial nerve and profunda brachii artery leave to enter the extensor compartment through a triangular gap between the long head of triceps, the humerus, and the lower margin of teres major. The remainder of the neurovascular structures pass through the flexor compartment (Fig. 2.22).

### Brachial Artery

This is the continuation of the axillary artery, which vessel has the axillary vein on its medial side. In the arm, the vein is seen to be formed from venae comitantes to the brachial artery, strongly reinforced above by the basilic vein, which perforates the deep fascia at a point opposite the deltoid insertion. The brachial artery has the median nerve lateral to it above (Fig. 2.12), but the nerve crosses very obliquely in front of the artery and lies on its medial side below. The ulnar nerve, posterior to the artery above, leaves it in the lower part of the arm and slopes backwards through the medial intermuscular septum. The vessel is superficial throughout its course in the arm, lying immediately deep to the deep fascia. It passes into the cubital fossa before dividing into the radial and ulnar arteries (p. 92), but occasionally the division is in the proximal part of the arm, giving rise to a superficial radial artery which may be mistaken for a superficial vein.

To palpate the artery in the upper arm, the finger pressure must be directed laterally, not backwards, since the vessel here lies medial to the humerus (Fig. 2.15). The surface marking for the vessel is along a line from the medial bicipital groove behind coracobrachialis to the middle of the cubital fossa at a point level with the neck of the radius.

**Surgical approach.** The artery can be exposed at the medial border of biceps, in the groove between biceps and triceps. The deep fascia is incised and the groove opened up to display the neurovascular bundle embedded in connective tissue that is the downward continuation of the axillary sheath.

**Branches.** Apart from the terminal radial and ulnar arteries (p. 92), the largest branch is the profunda brachii artery. It leaves through the lower triangular space to run in the radial groove with the radial nerve. It supplies triceps and ends as anterior and posterior anastomotic branches which join the cubital anastomosis (p. 93).

Other branches are the superior ulnar collateral which accompanies the ulnar nerve (p. 82), and the inferior ulnar collateral which divides into anterior and posterior branches; all take part in the cubital anastomosis (p. 93). There are also muscular branches to flexor muscles, and a nutrient artery to the humerus which enters the bone near the coracobrachialis attachment.

### Veins of the Arm

Venae comitantes accompany the brachial artery and all its branches. In addition, the basilic and cephalic veins course upwards through the subcutaneous tissue (Fig. 2.23). The former perforates the deep fascia in the middle of the arm, the latter lies in the groove between deltoid and pectoralis major and ends by piercing the clavipectoral fascia to enter the axillary vein.

### Median Nerve

The nerve (Fig. 2.12) is formed at the lower border of the axilla by the union of its medial and lateral roots, from the corresponding cords of the brachial plexus. The axillary artery is clasped between the two roots, the medial root crossing in front of the vessel. The commencement of the nerve is thus lateral to the artery. Passing distally through the arm, the nerve lies in front of the brachial artery and at the elbow is found on its medial side. The nerve has no muscular branches in the arm (unless the nerve to pronator teres has an unusually high origin, Fig. 2.30), but it gives sympathetic filaments to the brachial artery and a twig to the elbow joint.

The surface marking of the nerve is along a line from the groove behind coracobrachialis to the cubital fossa medial to the (palpable) brachial artery.

### Musculocutaneous Nerve

Giving a twig to the shoulder joint and a branch to coracobrachialis (Fig. 2.12), the nerve proceeds between the two conjoined parts of coracobrachialis (p. 78), and comes to lie between biceps and brachialis, accompanied by many branches of the brachial artery and tributaries of the brachial veins. While lying in this intermuscular plane, it supplies both muscles. Its remaining fibers, purely cutaneous now, appear at the lateral margin of the biceps tendon as the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm (Fig. 2.30). The musculocutaneous is the nerve of the flexor compartment of the arm, supplying all three muscles therein.

### Ulnar Nerve

Lying posterior to the vessels, this nerve inclines backwards away from them and pierces the medial intermuscular septum in the lower third of the arm, accompanied by the superior ulnar collateral artery and a branch of the radial nerve to the medial head of triceps (the ulnar collateral nerve). It gives no branch in the arm; its branch to the elbow joint comes off as it lies in the groove behind the medial epicondyle of the humerus.

The surface marking of the nerve is along a line from the groove behind coracobrachialis to the point behind the medial epicondyle of the humerus where it is readily palpable.

### Medial Cutaneous Nerve of the Arm

Lying anterior to the vessels, this small nerve pierces the deep fascia in the upper part of the arm and supplies the skin on the front and medial side of the upper part of the arm (Fig. 2.57).

### Medial Cutaneous Nerve of the Forearm

Commencing on the medial side of the vessels, this large nerve passes anterior to them and pierces the deep fascia on the medial side of the arm together with the basilic vein. It supplies skin over the lower part of the arm; the main part of the nerve passes into the medial side of the forearm (Fig. 2.57).

### Intercostobrachial Nerve

The skin of the axilla is supplied by the lateral cutaneous branch of the second intercostal nerve. This nerve, known as the intercostobrachial, extends for a variable distance into the skin on the medial side of the upper arm (Fig. 2.57). Not infrequently, the lateral cutaneous branch of the third intercostal nerve also extends out to supply the skin of the axilla.

### Lymph Nodes of the Arm

Two groups of lymph nodes (not part of the axillary group, p. 69) are found in the arm. The infraclavicular group lie along the cephalic vein in the upper part of the deltopectoral groove and drain through the clavipectoral fascia into the apical axillary nodes. The supratrochlear group lie in the subcutaneous fat just above the medial epicondyle. They drain the superficial tissues of the ulnar side of the forearm and hand, the afferent lymphatics running with the median basilic vein and its tributaries. Their efferent vessels pass to the lateral group of axillary nodes.

## Extensor Compartment of the Arm

The extensor compartment is occupied by the triceps muscle, through which run the radial nerve and profunda artery. The ulnar nerve runs through the lower part of this compartment.

### Triceps Brachii

The three heads of this muscle are named long, lateral, and medial - unfortunate names, since the medial would be far better called the deep head, and the long head is, in fact, medial. The long head arises from the infraglenoid tubercle at the upper end of the axillary border of the scapula. The lateral head has a linear origin (Fig. 2.16) from the back of the humerus extending from the surgical neck to the top of the deltoid insertion. The long and lateral heads converge and fuse into a flattened tendon which lies superficially on the lower part of the muscle, and is inserted into the posterior part of the upper surface of the olecranon (Fig. 2.24). The medial head arises on the medial side of the radial groove of the humerus. Thus, in its upper part, it lies medial to the lateral head, with the radial nerve and profunda brachii vessels between them. Below the radial groove, however, the origin widens to include the whole posterior surface of the humerus and of each intermuscular septum. The fibers of the medial head that arise from the lateral intermuscular septum actually occupy a more lateral position, during contraction, than those of the lateral head. The fibers of the medial head are inserted partly into the olecranon and partly into the deep part of the flattened tendon described above. A few fibers are inserted into the posterior part of the capsule of the elbow joint to prevent its being nipped in extension of the forearm (cf. articularis genu).

**Nerve supply.** By the radial nerve (C7, 8), by four branches; the medial head receives two. In order from above downwards, the branches go to the long, medial, lateral, and medial heads, and they arise before the radial nerve makes contact with the bone of the radial groove (see below). Fractures of the middle of the shaft of the humerus, even though they may damage the radial nerve, are not likely to cause paralysis of triceps because of the high origin of the branches.

**Action.** The muscle is the extensor of the elbow joint, especially when speed and power are needed. The long head is an important factor in stabilizing the abducted shoulder joint to supplement gravity, and it aids in extending the shoulder joint (p. 77).

**Test.** With the arm abducted to a right angle, the flexed forearm is extended against resistance and the muscle seen and felt. The arm must be abducted at the shoulder otherwise gravity will help to extend the flexed forearm.

### Radial Nerve

Leaving the axilla as described on page 69, the nerve (Fig. 2.15) accompanies the profunda brachii vessels and spirals obliquely downwards behind the humerus from medial to lateral, lying for the most part behind the uppermost fibers of the medial head of triceps which separates it from the bone. Only at the lateral edge of the humerus is the nerve in contact with the periosteum of the lower end of the radial groove (often called the spiral groove), so that contrary to popular belief, it does not occupy the whole length of the groove. The uppermost fibers of origin of brachialis cover the lowest part of the groove, and in this region the nerve pierces the lateral intermuscular septum to enter the anterior compartment and so reach the cubital fossa where it lies under cover of brachioradialis (Fig. 2.30). Before reaching the humerus, the nerve has already given off two of its four branches to triceps (to the long and medial heads) and the posterior cutaneous nerve of the arm (p. 69). Behind the humerus, it gives off the branch to the lateral head and another to the medial head which continues down through triceps to supply anconeus. The main nerve also gives origin to the lower lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm and the posterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm. It is characteristic of the radial nerve to give off its branches at a level considerably proximal to the part to be innervated.

The surface marking of the nerve is from the point where the posterior wall of the axilla and arm meet to a point two-thirds of the way along a line from the acromion to the lateral epicondyle, and thence to the front of the epicondyle.

### Profunda Brachii Artery

This is the vessel of supply to the triceps. At the lateral intermuscular septum, it divides into anterior and posterior branches; only the former pierces the septum. Each runs downwards, in front of and behind the elbow, to join the cubital anastomosis (Fig. 2.34).

### Ulnar Nerve

The nerve courses through the lower part of the extensor compartment and disappears into the forearm by passing between the humeral and ulnar heads of origin of flexor carpi ulnaris (Fig. 2.41). It lies in contact with the bone in the groove behind the medial epicondyle, then lies against the medial ligament of the elbow joint, to which it gives a twig of supply.

## Elbow Joint

This is a synovial joint of the hinge variety between the lower end of the humerus and the upper ends of radius and ulna (Figs 2.25-2.28). It communicates with the proximal radioulnar joint, in contrast to the wrist, which does not communicate with the distal radioulnar joint.

The lower end of the humerus shows the prominent conjunction of capitulum and trochlea (Fig. 2.25). The capitulum, for the head of the radius, is a portion of a sphere. It projects forward, and also downwards, where its lower border lies at the distal extremity of the humerus. In contrast, the trochlea, which lies medial, is a grooved surface that extends around the lower end of the humerus to the posterior surface of the bone. The groove of the trochlea is limited medially by a sharp and prominent ridge and laterally by a lower and blunter ridge that blends with the articular surface of the capitulum. Thus is produced a tilt on the lower end of the humerus that accounts in part for the carrying angle of the elbow. Fossae immediately above the capitulum and trochlea receive the head of the radius and coronoid process of the ulna in full flexion; posteriorly, a deep fossa receives the olecranon in full extension (Fig. 2.62).

The upper surface of the cylindrical head of the radius is spherically concave to fit the capitulum.

The upper end of the ulna shows the deep trochlear notch. A curved ridge joins the prominences of coronoid process and olecranon; the ridge fits the groove in the trochlea of the humerus. The obliquity of the shaft of the ulna to this ridge accounts for most of the carrying angle at the elbow (Fig. 2.63). There are commonly two separate articular surfaces in the trochlear notch, one on the olecranon and the other on the coronoid process.

The capsule is attached to the humerus at the margins of the lower rounded ends of the articular surfaces of capitulum and trochlea, but in front and behind it is carried up over the bone above the coronoid and olecranon fossae (Figs 2.26 and 2.62). Distally, the capsule is attached to the trochlear notch of the ulna at the edge of the articular cartilage, and to the annular ligament of the proximal radioulnar joint (Fig. 2.28). It is not attached to the radius.

The capsule and annular ligament are lined with synovial membrane, which is attached to the articular margins of all three bones. The synovial membrane thus floors in the coronoid and olecranon fossae on the lower end of the humerus, and bridges the gap between the radial notch of the ulna and the neck of the radius. The quadrate ligament (p. 95) prevents herniation of the synovial membrane between the anterior and posterior free edges of the annular ligament.

The ulnar collateral (medial) ligament of the elbow joint is triangular (Fig. 2.26) and consists of three bands. The anterior band is the strongest. It passes from the medial epicondyle of the humerus to a small tubercle (unnamed but previously called the sublime tubercle) on the medial border of the coronoid process. The posterior band joins the sublime tubercle and the medial border of the olecranon. A middle band connects these two and lies more deeply; it lodges the ulnar nerve on its way from the arm to the forearm (Fig. 2.27). The radial collateral (lateral) ligament (Fig. 2.28) is a single flattened band attached to the humerus below the common extensor origin; it fuses with the annular ligament of the head of the radius. The anterior and posterior ligaments are merely thickened parts of the capsule. The annular ligament is attached to the margins of the radial notch of the ulna, and clasps the head of the radius, allowing it to rotate freely.

**Movements.** The only appreciable movement possible at the elbow joint is the simple hinge movement of flexion and extension. From the straight (extended) position, the range of flexion is about 140°. This movement does not take place in the line of the humerus, for the axis of the hinge lies obliquely. The extended ulna makes with the humerus an angle of about 170°. This so-called carrying angle fits the elbow into the waist when the arm is at the side, and it is significant that the obliquity of the ulna is more pronounced in women than in men. However, the line of the upper arm and forearm becomes straightened out when the forearm is in the usual working position of almost full pronation (Fig. 2.35). A pathological increase in this valgus angle (e.g., from a fractured lateral epicondyle or damaged epiphysis) may gradually stretch the ulnar nerve behind the medial epicondyle and cause an ulnar nerve palsy. During pronation-supination of the forearm, there is some rocking movement of the ulna on the trochlea (p. 96). In extension, the tip of the olecranon lies in line with the humeral epicondyles, but in full flexion, these three bony points make an equilateral triangle.

**Surgical approach.** The commonest approaches are from the sides. Medially, the ulnar nerve is displaced backwards and the common flexor origin detached to expose the capsule, while on the lateral side, the common extensor origin can be similarly detached. On this side, the capsule incision must not extend lower than the level of the head of the radius to avoid damage to the posterior interosseous nerve as it winds round the shaft within the supinator.

## Flexor Compartment of the Forearm

The flexor muscles in the forearm are arranged in two groups, superficial and deep. The five muscles of the superficial group cross the elbow joint; the three muscles of the deep group do not. The flexor compartment is much more bulky than the extensor compartment, for the necessary power of the grip. The extensor muscles merely release the grip.

### Superficial Group

These five muscles (Fig. 2.29) are distinguished by the fact that they possess a common origin from the medial epicondyle of the humerus, at its anterior surface. Three of the group have additional areas of origin. The common origin attaches itself to a smooth area on the anterior surface of the medial epicondyle (Fig. 2.25); there is but little flesh attached to the humerus, for at this point the intermuscular septa and the muscles themselves arise. The order of the muscles from medial to lateral is: pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, flexor digitorum superficialis, flexor carpi ulnaris. A useful mnemonic is: "Pass Fail Pass Fail Pass" for the muscles, and "Thumb Index Middle Ring Little" for the fingers, or "Thumb for pronator teres, index finger for flexor digitorum superficialis, ring finger for palmaris longus, little finger for flexor carpi ulnaris."

### Pronator Teres

Arising from the common origin and from the lower part of the medial supracondylar ridge, the main superficial belly is joined by the small deep head, which arises from the medial border of the coronoid process of the ulna just distal to the sublime tubercle. The median nerve lies between the two heads and the ulnar artery passes deep to the deep head. The muscle, forming the medial border of the cubital fossa (Figs 2.29 and 2.30), runs distally across the front of the forearm to be inserted by a flat tendon into the most prominent part of the lateral convexity of the radius, between the lower ends of the anterior and posterior oblique lines. The attachment lies just behind the lateral profile of the radius (Fig. 2.64).

**Nerve supply.** By the median nerve (C6, 7).

**Action.** It pronates the forearm and assists in flexion of the elbow. In median nerve paralysis, it can be transplanted to the posterior compartment to extend the joint.

**Test.** From the supine position, the forearm is pronated against resistance and the muscle palpated at the medial margin of the cubital fossa.

### Flexor Carpi Radialis

Arising from the common origin, the fleshy belly lies distal to pronator teres. In the middle of the forearm, the flesh gives way to a flattened tendon which becomes rounded at the wrist, where it runs through its own compartment in the flexor retinaculum, and then lies in the groove of the trapezium. It passes beside the tendon of flexor pollicis longus and is inserted into the bases of the second and third metacarpals (symmetrically with extensors longus and brevis). Quite frequently, it gives a slip of insertion into the scaphoid bone. The absence of fleshy fibers distinguishes the tendon above the wrist (Figs 2.29 and 2.31) from that of flexor pollicis longus, which is feathered by fleshy fibers joining it from the radial side. The tendon is a prominent landmark towards the radial side of the front of the wrist. The radial artery lies lateral to the tendon and the median nerve (and the tendon of palmaris longus, if present) medial to it.

**Nerve supply.** By the median nerve (C6, 7).

**Action.** It is a flexor and radial abductor of the wrist and assists in pronation of the forearm and flexion of the elbow. It is an important stabilizer of the wrist in finger and thumb movements.

### Flexor Digitorum Superficialis

This is the largest of the superficial muscles. It arises from the common origin, from the anterior oblique line of the radius, and from a fibrous arch that stretches between the two. The fibrous arch is the upper limit of the space of Parona (p. 92). Above the wrist, the tendons appear on each side of the palmaris longus tendon. The flesh which gives rise to the tendons for the middle and ring fingers is superficial across the wide origin of the muscle. That giving rise to the tendons of the index and little fingers arises more deeply from the common flexor origin and ulnar collateral (medial) ligament of the elbow. It lies beneath the belly for the middle two fingers, and is divided by a transverse tendinous intersection into an upper and two lower bellies. The tendons pass in the above order beneath the flexor retinaculum, i.e., those to the middle and ring fingers superficial to those to the index and little finger (Fig. 2.46). Their course in the palm and insertion into the middle phalanges is considered on page 117. In the forearm, the muscle has the median nerve plastered to its deep surface by areolar tissue (Fig. 2.32); the commencing profundus tendon for the index finger can readily be mistaken for the nerve at operation or in a dissection.

**Nerve supply.** By the median nerve (C7, 8, T1).

**Action.** It flexes the proximal interphalangeal joints and, still acting, flexes the metacarpophalangeal and wrist joints. It also assists in flexion of the elbow and wrist.

**Test.** The fingers are flexed at the proximal interphalangeal joints against resistance applied to the middle phalanges (but remember that flexor digitorum profundus can also flex these joints).

### Palmaris Longus

Functionally negligible, this muscle is of morphological interest. It is absent in 13% of arms. It is phylogenetically degenerating and shows the characteristics of this, i.e., short belly and long tendon (like plantaris in the leg). Replacement of its distal tendon by ligament (palmar aponeurosis) is a further characteristic of degeneration (like coccygeus and the sacrospinous ligament). It is supposed that the muscle once existed as a flexor of the proximal phalanges, with its tendons lying in the palm superficial to those of flexor digitorum superficialis, and splitting around them to be attached to the proximal phalanges. The muscle arises from the common origin and its tendon (Fig. 2.29) is inserted, adherent across the front of the flexor retinaculum, into the palmar aponeurosis. The main importance of the muscle is that its tendon slightly overlaps the median nerve from the ulnar side, and it must not be mistaken for the nerve (p. 94).

**Action.** It is a weak flexor of the wrist, and by its attachment to the palmar aponeurosis it may produce minimal flexion at the metacarpophalangeal joints of the fingers. In radial nerve paralysis, the tendon can be transplanted to abduct the thumb.

**Test.** The wrist is flexed and the tendon palpated when the pads of the thumb and little finger are pinched together (to help fix the wrist and so make the tendon stand out).

### Flexor Carpi Ulnaris

Arising from the common origin, the muscle receives a further contribution from a wide aponeurosis which arises from the medial border of the olecranon and the upper three-fourths of the subcutaneous border of the ulna. This aponeurosis lies superficial to the belly of flexor digitorum profundus - the latter gives the bulk to the medial side of the upper forearm. It lies edge to edge, at the subcutaneous border of the ulna, with the aponeurosis of extensor carpi ulnaris (Fig. 2.39). The ulnar nerve enters the flexor compartment of the forearm by passing between the humeral and ulnar heads of this muscle. Its tendon of insertion passes to the pisiform (Fig. 2.29). The pisiform is morphologically a sesamoid bone in the tendon; by way of the pisohamate and pisometacarpal ligaments, the muscle acts on a wider insertion. Its symmetry with the insertion of extensor carpi ulnaris into the base of the fifth metacarpal is maintained by way of the pisometacarpal ligament.

**Nerve supply.** By the ulnar nerve (C7, 8) through two to four branches. In 95% of cases, the fibers have come from the lateral cord of the brachial plexus, or rarely from the middle trunk by a communication in the axilla; this is the contribution from C7 (the rest of the ulnar nerve being derived from C8, T1).

**Action.** It is a flexor of the wrist, an ulnar adductor when acting with extensor carpi ulnaris, and a fixator of the pisiform during contraction of the hypothenar muscles. It acts as a synergist during wrist extension. In radial nerve paralysis, the tendon can be transplanted to extend the fingers or thumb.

**Test.** The little finger is abducted against resistance; this fixes the pisiform which gives origin to abductor digiti minimi, and the tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris can be seen and palpated proximal to the bone. Alternatively, the wrist can be flexed and adducted against resistance.

### Cubital Fossa

The cubital fossa is the triangular area between pronator teres, brachioradialis, and a line joining the humeral epicondyles (Fig. 2.30). It possesses a roof and floor, and certain structures pass through it. The roof is formed by the deep fascia of the forearm, reinforced on the medial side by the bicipital aponeurosis. On the bicipital aponeurosis lies the median basilic vein with the medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm on its medial side; the aponeurosis separates these structures from the underlying median nerve and brachial artery. Laterally on the roof lie the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm and the median cephalic vein. The floor is formed in the main by the brachialis muscle; below and laterally, the supinator clasps the neck of the radius.

The contents of the fossa, from medial to lateral side, are the median nerve, brachial artery, and the tendon of biceps. Farther laterally are the radial nerve and its posterior interosseous branch, but these are only seen when brachioradialis is retracted laterally (Fig. 2.30). The artery is palpated here medial to the tendon to define the position for placing the stethoscope when taking the blood pressure. The further courses of the brachial artery and median nerve are discussed below (pp. 92 and 94). The radial nerve, having given branches to the brachialis and brachioradialis muscles, lower down gives another branch to extensor carpi radialis longus. It then divides into its two terminal branches, the superficial (cutaneous) branch and the deep branch, commonly called the posterior interosseous nerve. The latter gives branches to extensor carpi radialis brevis and supinator and disappears from the fossa by passing between the two heads of origin of the supinator muscle (Figs 2.29 and 2.30). The superficial branch passes down the forearm under cover of the brachioradialis (p. 98) and the posterior interosseous nerve enters the extensor compartment (p. 103).

### Deep Group

The group consists of flexor digitorum profundus, flexor pollicis longus, and pronator quadratus (Fig. 2.31). The two former are subdivisions of a common deep flexor from which a third (which might be called flexor indicis profundus) appears to be phylogenetically emerging.

### Flexor Digitorum Profundus

The most powerful and the bulkiest of the forearm muscles, it arises by fleshy fibers from the medial surface of the olecranon (Fig. 2.27), from the upper three-fourths of the medial and anterior surfaces of the ulna as far distally as pronator quadratus, and from a narrow strip of interosseous membrane. The tendon for the index separates in the forearm; the three other tendons are still partly attached to each other as they pass across the carpal bones in the flexor tunnel and do not become detached from each other until they reach the palm (Fig. 2.31). At this point of separation, the four lumbricals take origin. They are described in the section on the hand (p. 112).

**Nerve supply.** By the anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve and by the ulnar nerve (C7, 8). Characteristically, these nerves share equally; the bellies which merge into the tendons for the index and middle fingers being supplied from the median, the ring and little fingers from the ulnar nerves. The corresponding lumbricals are similarly supplied.

This distribution of 2:2 between median and ulnar nerves occurs in only 60% of individuals. In the remaining 40%, the median and ulnar distribution is 3:1 or 1:3 equally (20% each). Whatever the variation, however, the rule is that each lumbrical is supplied by the same nerve which innervates the belly of its parent tendon.

**Action.** It flexes the terminal interphalangeal joints and, still acting, rolls the fingers and wrist into flexion. It is the great gripping muscle. Extension of the wrist is indispensable to the full power of contraction of the muscle (Fig. 2.55).

**Test.** With the fingers extended and the hand lying supine on the table, the distal interphalangeal joints are flexed against resistance with the middle phalanx held in extension.

### Flexor Pollicis Longus

This muscle arises from the anterior surface of the radius below the anterior oblique line and above the insertion of pronator quadratus, and from an adjoining strip of interosseous membrane. Some fibers, arising in common with flexor digitorum superficialis, join the muscle from either the medial or the lateral border (or both) of the coronoid process of the ulna. The tendon forms on the ulnar side of this unipennate muscle; it should be noted that the tendon receives fleshy fibers into its radial side to a point just above the wrist, a useful point in distinguishing it from the flexor carpi radialis in window dissections or in wounds above the wrist (Fig. 2.31). The tendon passes in the carpal tunnel deep to that of the flexor carpi radialis, then spirals around its ulnar side to become superficial. It extends into the thumb to be inserted into the base of the distal phalanx.

**Nerve supply.** By the anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve (C8, T1).

**Action.** It is the only flexor of the interphalangeal joint of the thumb, and also flexes the metacarpophalangeal and carpometacarpal joints of the thumb and the wrist joint.

**Test.** With the proximal phalanx of the thumb held steady, the distal phalanx is flexed against resistance.

### Pronator Quadratus

Arising from the lower fourth of the ulna, especially from the sinuous ridge on its anteromedial aspect, the fibers are inserted, superficially into the ridge on the anterolateral border of the radius above the styloid process (Fig. 2.33), more deeply into the anterior surface of the lower end of the radius, and most deeply into the triangular interosseous area just above the ulnar notch. The interosseous membrane clings to the posterior border of this triangular area, the sacciform recess of the distal radioulnar joint lies just in front of it, and the muscle is inserted into the remainder of the area.

**Nerve supply.** By the anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve (C8, T1).

**Action.** It is the chief pronator of the forearm, and its transverse fibers are important in helping to hold the lower ends of the radius and ulna together, especially when the hand is weight-bearing. As a pronator, it is more powerful than pronator teres, since its fibers run transversely and not obliquely. The muscle is too deep to be palpated.

### Space of Parona

In front of pronator quadratus and deep to the long flexor tendons of the fingers is a space into which the proximal parts of the flexor synovial sheaths protrude. The space is limited proximally by the oblique origin of flexor digitorum superficialis. The space becomes involved in proximal extensions of synovial sheath infections; it can easily be drained through radial and ulnar incisions to the side of the flexor tendons.

## Arteries and Nerves of the Forearm

The general arrangement of the deep arteries and nerves of the forearm is that a nerve runs down each border of the forearm (radial and ulnar nerves), and the brachial artery divides into branches (radial and ulnar arteries) that run down to approach these nerves but do not cross them. The median nerve, on the deep surface of flexor superficialis, crosses the ulnar artery to lie between the two. Radial and ulnar arteries supply the hand; they run down directly into deep and superficial palmar arches. The arterial supply for the forearm comes from the common interosseous branch of the ulnar, which divides into posterior and anterior interosseous arteries. The posterior interosseous artery is rather a failure. Assisted at first by branches of the anterior interosseous that pierce the interosseous membrane, it later fails and is replaced by the anterior interosseous artery, which pierces the membrane to enter the extensor compartment (Fig. 2.33). Anterior (from median) and posterior (from radial) interosseous nerves, on the other hand, remain in their own compartments right down to the wrist, supplying muscles, periosteum, and carpal ligaments. Neither nerve reaches the skin.

### Radial Artery

The brachial artery enters the forearm by passing into the cubital fossa in the midline; halfway down the fossa, it divides into radial and ulnar arteries (Fig. 2.34). The radial usually appears to be the direct continuation of the brachial artery, whereas the ulnar branches off almost at a right angle (Fig. 2.30).

The radial artery passes distally medial to the biceps tendon, across the supinator, over the tendon of insertion of the pronator teres, the radial origin of flexor digitorum superficialis, the origin of the flexor pollicis longus, the insertion of pronator quadratus, and the lower end of the radius (Fig. 2.33). It disappears beneath the tendons of abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis to cross the anatomical snuffbox (Fig. 2.42). In the upper part of the forearm, it is overlapped anteriorly by brachioradialis (Fig. 2.29). In the middle of the forearm, it lies on flexor pollicis longus, and in the lower part, it lies on the radius.

The surface marking of the artery is along a line, slightly convex laterally, from medial to the biceps tendon in the cubital fossa to a point medial to the styloid process of the radius. It can be surgically exposed at its lower end (p. 92) which is the commonest site for arterial cannulation. The small size of the vessel predisposes to thrombosis (which is rare when the femoral artery is used, p. 155); air embolus is a possible complication.

### Ulnar Artery

The ulnar artery disappears from the cubital fossa by passing deep to the deep head of pronator teres and beneath the fibrous arch of the flexor digitorum superficialis near the median nerve. It then leaves the median nerve and lies on flexor digitorum profundus with the ulnar nerve to its ulnar side and passes down over the front of the wrist into the palm, where it continues as the superficial palmar arch (p. 110). Ulnar artery pulsation can be felt on the radial side of the tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris just above the pisiform bone.

Its chief branch is the common interosseous (Fig. 2.34), which divides into anterior and posterior interosseous branches. The anterior interosseous artery lies deeply on the interosseous membrane between flexor digitorum profundus and flexor pollicis longus, supplying each. Perforating branches pierce the interosseous membrane to supply the deep extensor muscles. Nutrient vessels are given to both radius and ulna. The artery passes posteriorly through the interosseous membrane at the level of the upper border of pronator quadratus (compare with the peroneal artery in the leg) (Fig. 2.33).

The posterior interosseous artery disappears by passing backwards through the interosseous space above the upper end of the interosseous membrane but distal to the oblique cord (compare with the anterior tibial artery in the leg).

### Anastomosis Around the Elbow Joint

Recurrent branches, in some cases double, arise from radial, ulnar, and interosseous arteries and run upwards both anterior and posterior to the elbow joint, to anastomose with descending articular branches of the profunda brachii, and the ulnar collateral arteries (Fig. 2.34).

### Anastomosis Around the Wrist Joint

Both radial and ulnar arteries give off anterior and posterior carpal branches. These anastomose with each other deep to the long tendons, forming the anterior and posterior carpal arches. The anterior carpal arch lies transversely across the wrist joint (Fig. 2.33); it supplies the carpal bones and sends branches distally into the hand to anastomose with the deep palmar arch. The posterior carpal arch lies transversely across the distal row of carpal bones (p. 105). It sends dorsal metacarpal arteries distally into each metacarpal space; these divide to supply the fingers and they anastomose through the interosseous spaces with the palmar digital and metacarpal branches of the palmar arches. Thus a free anastomosis is established between radial and ulnar arteries through the carpal and palmar arches (Fig. 2.33).

### Veins of the Forearm

The deep veins are plentiful and accompany the arteries, usually by double venae comitantes which anastomose freely with each other. They drain the forearm but bring relatively little blood from the hand.

Most of the blood from the palm of the hand passes through to a superficial venous network on the dorsum. From the radial side of this arch, the cephalic vein begins in the anatomical snuffbox and runs up along the preaxial border of the limb (Fig. 2.23). It runs in the upper arm lateral to biceps, in the deltopectoral groove, and perforates the clavipectoral fascia to drain into the axillary vein. From the ulnar side of the dorsal venous arch, the basilic vein runs up the postaxial border of the limb. It pierces the deep fascia halfway between the elbow and axilla (Fig. 2.23) and joins the brachial veins to form the axillary vein.

The median forearm vein drains subcutaneous tissue of the front of the wrist and forearm. It divides at the elbow into median cephalic and median basilic; the latter receives a deep vein. These two veins open into the cephalic and basilic veins respectively (Fig. 2.23). The deep communicating vein joins the median basilic vein and makes it a larger vessel than the median cephalic. The median cephalic is much less movable in the subcutaneous tissues than the median basilic, and therefore is often more convenient to use in intravenous therapy in spite of its smaller size. There are frequent variations from the standard patterns just described.

### Lymphatics of the Forearm

As elsewhere in the body, the superficial lymphatics follow veins, the deep ones follow arteries. From the ulnar side of the hand and forearm, the subcutaneous lymphatics run alongside the basilic vein to the supratrochlear nodes. From the radial side, the lymphatics run alongside the cephalic vein to the deltopectoral and infraclavicular nodes. From the deep parts of the hand and forearm and from the supratrochlear nodes, lymphatics pass to the lateral group of axillary nodes.

### Cutaneous Nerves of the Forearm

The lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm, the cutaneous continuation of the musculocutaneous nerve, pierces the deep fascia above the elbow lateral to the lower end of biceps (where the muscle fibers become tendinous), and supplies the preaxial border of the forearm, by anterior and posterior branches, as far distally as the ball of the thumb. The medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm is roughly symmetrical with the lateral cutaneous nerve, supplying the postaxial border of the forearm by anterior and posterior branches as far distally as the wrist. Their areas of cutaneous distribution meet at the anterior axial line (p. 23), where there is minimal overlap (Fig. 2.57).

The superficial branch of the radial nerve, the cutaneous continuation of the main nerve, runs from the cubital fossa on the surface of supinator, pronator teres tendon, and flexor digitorum superficialis on the lateral side of the forearm under cover of brachioradialis. While under cover, it lies on the radial side of the radial artery. It leaves the flexor compartment of the forearm by passing backwards under the tendon of brachioradialis a few centimeters above the radial styloid, and breaks up into two or three branches which can be rolled on the surface of the tautened tendon of extensor pollicis longus. They are distributed to the radial two-thirds of the dorsum of the hand and the proximal parts of the dorsal surfaces of the thumb, index, middle, and half of the ring fingers (Fig. 2.43), but see page 126 for the effects of nerve injury.

### Median Nerve

The median nerve, while still in the cubital fossa, gives a branch to pronator teres then disappears between the two heads of that muscle. Beyond the muscle, it supplies flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus, and then joins the ulnar artery at the fibrous arch of the superficial flexor. Deep to flexor digitorum superficialis, it passes distally in the midline of the forearm closely attached by areolar tissue to the deep surface of the muscle, which it supplies. It emerges from the lateral border of the muscle (Fig. 2.29), between palmaris longus and flexor carpi radialis tendons, and is slightly overlapped from the ulnar side by the tendon of palmaris longus before passing beneath the flexor retinaculum to enter the hand (p. 111). At the wrist, the nerve is not round but flattened. It is nourished by the median artery, a branch of the anterior interosseous which was the original axial artery of the fetal limb. It may persist as a large vessel. Small twigs from it on the surface of the nerve help at operation to distinguish the nerve from adjacent tendons.

The median nerve gives off an anterior interosseous branch which runs down with the artery of the same name and supplies flexor digitorum profundus (usually the bellies which move index and middle fingers), flexor pollicis longus, and pronator quadratus, also the interosseous membrane and the periosteum of the radius and ulna. It ends in the anterior part of the capsule of the wrist joint and the carpal joints, which it supplies. It has no cutaneous branch.

Just above the flexor retinaculum, the median nerve gives off a palmar branch to the skin over the thenar muscles.

The surface marking of the nerve is along a line from the point in the middle of the cubital fossa medial to the (palpable) brachial artery to a point at the wrist on the ulnar side of the tendon of flexor carpi radialis.

### Ulnar Nerve

The ulnar nerve enters the forearm from the extensor compartment by passing between the humeral and ulnar heads of origin of flexor carpi ulnaris. It is more easily compressed against the medial surface of the coronoid process (Fig. 2.27) than against the humerus where it lies behind the medial epicondyle (Fig. 2.39). In the forearm, the nerve lies under cover of the flattened aponeurosis of flexor carpi ulnaris with the ulnar artery to its radial side. This neurovascular bundle lies on flexor digitorum profundus. Branches of supply are given to flexor carpi ulnaris and the ulnar half (usually) of flexor digitorum profundus. The branch to flexor carpi ulnaris contains C7 fibers brought to the ulnar nerve in the axilla (p. 90); the branch to flexor digitorum profundus contains C8 and T1 fibers.

The ulnar nerve and ulnar artery emerge from beneath the tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris just proximal to the wrist (Fig. 2.29) and pass across the flexor retinaculum into the hand. Before emerging, each gives off a dorsal branch which passes medially between the tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris and the lower end of the ulna. The dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve supplies the dorsum of the hand (Fig. 2.43) and of the ulnar one and a half fingers proximal to their nail beds. The dorsal branch of the ulnar artery enters the posterior carpal arch. The small palmar cutaneous branch of the nerve runs down on the artery to pierce the deep fascia proximal to the flexor retinaculum, and supplies skin of the hypothenar eminence.

The surface marking of the nerve is along a line from the medial epicondyle of the humerus to the radial side of the pisiform bone.

## Radioulnar Joints

The proximal radioulnar joint has been mentioned in connection with the elbow joint (p. 84). The essential structure here is the annular ligament which imprisons the head of the radius (Fig. 2.28). The annular ligament is attached to the radial notch of the ulna and its fibers encircle the head and neck of the radius. The ligament has no attachment to the radius, which is free to rotate within it. Superiorly, it blends with the capsule of the elbow joint. The proximal radioulnar joint and the elbow joint form one continuous synovial cavity. The synovial membrane is attached to the radius at the lower margin of the cylindrical articular surface; it is supported between the ulna and the radius by the quadrate ligament. This stretches between the neck of the radius, proximal to the tuberosity, and the upper part of the supinator fossa of the ulna just distal to the radial notch. Its fibers run criss-cross, so that some are tense while others relax; its overall tension remains constant in all positions of supination and pronation.

The distal radioulnar joint is closed distally by a triangular fibrocartilage, which is attached by its base to the ulnar notch of the radius and by its apex to a small fossa at the base of the ulnar styloid. The capsule is loose and pouches upwards between the two bones behind the surface of the deep part of pronator quadratus, forming the sacciform recess. It is unusual for the fibrocartilage to be incomplete; in such rare cases, of course, the joint communicates with the wrist joint.

The interosseous membrane joins the interosseous borders of the two bones. Its fibers run from the radius down to the ulna at an oblique angle, so transmitting thrust from the wrist to the elbow via the lower end of the radius to the upper end of the ulna and so to the humerus. It tends to be relaxed when the weight is suspended from the hands; but in this case, of course, the weight is suspended by muscles, not by bones or ligaments. It is taut in pronation and lax in supination.

The oblique cord has been considered to represent a degenerated portion of either flexor pollicis longus or supinator. Its fibers run in opposite obliquity to those of the interosseous membrane. The cord slopes upwards from just below the radial tuberosity to the side of the ulnar tuberosity, distal to the quadrate ligament. The posterior interosseous vessels pass through the gap between the oblique cord and the upper end of the interosseous membrane.

**Nerve supplies.** The proximal joint receives small twigs from the nerves of the elbow joint (p. 85), and the distal joint from the posterior interosseous (radial) and anterior interosseous (median) nerves.

### Movements

Examine the articulated bones of the upper limb. The basic movements of pronation and supination are produced by movements of the radius (and hand) around an immobile ulna. The axis around which the radius rotates obviously passes through the center of curvature of each radioulnar joint. The axis of pronation-supination is oblique along the supinated forearm - it joins the center of the head of the radius and the base of the styloid process of the ulna, and when prolonged passes near the little finger. It lies in the line of the shaft of the humerus, hence the carrying angle of the elbow (Fig. 2.35). For the ulna, as a result of the opposite curvatures of its upper and lower articular surfaces, must lie oblique to the axis of pronation-supination and therefore oblique to the shaft of the humerus, and this obliquity constitutes the carrying angle.

The axis of pronation-supination is fixed in relation to the ulna, but the axis of the forearm itself is not fixed in relation to the ulna. The axis of the forearm runs from the midpoint between the epicondyles of the humerus down to the midpoint between the styloid processes of the radius and ulna. The axis of the forearm is therefore constantly changing with the position of the bones throughout the range of pronation and supination. This can easily be seen by inspection of the dry bones and can be confirmed in the living forearm. It is illustrated in Figure 2.35. In supination, the axis of the forearm is parallel with the ulna; it is oblique to the shaft of the humerus (carrying angle). In pronation, the axis of the forearm crosses the ulna obliquely and lies parallel with the axis of pronation-supination; it is in line with the shaft of the humerus though the ulna has not moved. The carrying angle exists so that the forearm may be in line with the humerus in the working position, which is that of almost full pronation. Few acts except carrying are performed in the fully supinated position.

A simple experiment is worth performing. Flex the elbow to a right angle and lay the forearm on a table. Supination and pronation in this position are seen to cause a wide movement of the thumb from right to left; note also that the anterior surface of the distal extremity of the ulna remains facing towards the ceiling in all positions of the hand, even when the latter lies palm downwards. During this experiment, the ulna remains fixed and the hand moves around the axis of the little finger. Now repeat the movement with the flexed forearm free in mid-air. The axis of rotation of the forearm now no longer passes through the little finger, but has moved to the middle finger. The lower extremity of the ulna still faces forward as before; but it moves into slight adduction and abduction, during supination and pronation, in a manner beautifully coordinated. To the basic rotation of the radius around an immobile ulna is superadded a movement of the ulna itself; the actual motion performed by the wrist and hand is the resultant of these two movements (Fig. 2.36).

Ulnar movement is produced in two ways. In the usual working position with the elbow flexed (e.g., turning a screwdriver, a doorknob), abduction and adduction occur between the ulna and trochlea. Contraction of the anconeus causes slight abduction and pronation of the ulna, and these movements accompany pronation of the forearm. (Lecomte in 1874 named the anconeus the pronator of the ulna.) Ulnar abduction is opposed by the humeral head of pronator teres. This oblique pull adducts the radius (and hence the ulna). Ulnar movement is illustrated in Figure 2.37.

In the rarer movements around a more laterally placed center (lateral to the center of the palm), ulnar movement at the trochlea is insufficient. Ulnar abduction and adduction with the elbow flexed are then produced by rotation of the shaft of the humerus, under the action of the short scapular muscles.

The forearm can be pronated and supinated around any fingertip placed on a fixed point. Ulnar movement is least when the little fingertip is fixed, greatest when the index finger or thumb is fixed. The axis of rotation at the level of the wrist can thus be made to pass through any point between the styloid processes of the radius and ulna; and each styloid process describes a semicircle around that point (Fig. 2.38). Ulnar abduction and adduction are each accompanied by slight extension and then flexion at the elbow in order to bring this about. Thus, during pronation, the first half of the movement is accompanied by abduction and slight extension of the ulna, and the second half by further abduction and slight flexion of the ulna. Likewise, during supination, the first half of the movement is accompanied by adduction and slight extension of the ulna, and the second half by further adduction and slight flexion of the ulna.

Summarizing, simple pronation and supination about an immobile ulna are rare and unnatural movements. Almost always, they are accompanied by synergic movements at the shoulder and elbow (and rotation of the humerus) to produce simultaneous movement of the ulna.

The muscles producing pronation are principally pronator quadratus and pronator teres, with some small assistance from flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus (and brachioradialis as far as the midprone position). Supination is carried out by supinator and biceps, with some assistance from extensor pollicis longus and extensor carpi radialis longus. Note that pronation is essentially a function of the median nerve, while supination depends on the musculocutaneous nerve (biceps) and the radial nerve.

## Extensor Compartment of the Forearm

A dozen muscles occupy the extensor compartment. At the upper part are anconeus (superficial) and supinator (deep). From the lateral part of the humerus arise three muscles that pass along the radial side (brachioradialis, and extensors carpi radialis longus and brevis), and three that pass along the posterior surface of the forearm (extensors digitorum, digiti minimi, and carpi ulnaris). At the lower end of the forearm, these two groups are separated by three muscles that emerge from deeply in between them and go to the thumb (abductor pollicis longus and extensors pollicis longus and brevis). Finally, one muscle for the forefinger runs deeply to reach the back of the hand (extensor indicis).

The nerve of the extensor compartment is the posterior interosseous nerve, which reaches it by passing around the radius (compare the peroneal nerve in the leg); the artery is the posterior interosseous, which gains the extensor compartment by passing between the two bones (compare the anterior tibial artery in the leg). The artery is small and the blood supply of the posterior compartment is reinforced by the anterior interosseous artery.

The six long muscles that come from the lateral side of the humerus have not enough area available at the lateral epicondyle. Two of them arise high above this, from the lateral supracondylar ridge and the lateral intermuscular septum.

### Brachioradialis

Arising from the upper two-thirds of the lateral supracondylar ridge, the muscle passes along the preaxial border of the forearm to a tendon that is inserted at the base of the styloid process of the radius. The muscle forms the lateral border of the cubital fossa (Fig. 2.30); passing down the forearm, it overlies the radial nerve and the radial artery as they lie together on supinator, pronator teres tendon, flexor digitorum superficialis, and flexor pollicis longus. The lower part of the tendon is covered by abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis as they spiral down to the thumb (Fig. 2.39).

**Nerve supply.** By the radial nerve (C5, 6) from a branch arising above the elbow joint (before the posterior interosseous nerve is given off).

**Action.** Its action is to flex the elbow joint. It pulls on the radial styloid process, which is thus made the leading point as the forearm flexes; the ulnar side of the forearm passively follows, falling into the position of mid-pronation. This is purely passive. Electromyographic studies show that it is active in both pronation and supination, but only as a flexor of the elbow.

**Test.** With the forearm in the midprone position, the elbow is flexed against resistance; the muscle can be seen and felt.

### Extensor Carpi Radialis Longus

Arising from the lower third of the lateral supracondylar ridge of the humerus, the muscle passes down the forearm, behind brachioradialis (Fig. 2.39) and beneath the thumb muscles, to be inserted as a flattened tendon into the base of the second metacarpal.

**Action.** It is an extensor and abductor of the wrist and midcarpal joints. It is indispensable to the action of making a fist, acting as a synergist during finger flexion; its tendon can be felt and often seen when this is done (p. 119). It assists in flexion of the elbow. In paralysis of forearm flexor muscles, it can be transferred into flexor digitorum profundus.

**Test.** With the forearm pronated, the wrist is extended and abducted against resistance. The muscle is palpated below and behind the lateral side of the elbow, and the tendon palpated proximal to the anatomical snuffbox.

### Common Extensor Origin

Examine a humerus. The smooth area on the front of the lateral epicondyle is for the attachment of the common extensor origin (Fig. 2.25). From it arise the fused tendons of extensor carpi radialis brevis, extensor digitorum, extensor digiti minimi, and extensor carpi ulnaris. All four muscles pass to the posterior surface of the forearm. When the forearm is extended and supinated, they spiral around the upper end of the radius; behind this rounded mass of muscle is an elongated pit in which lies the head of the radius. In the working position of the forearm (flexed and half pronated), however, these muscles pass straight from the front of the lateral epicondyle into the forearm, as can be seen by an examination of the bones. It is for this reason that the common origin is on the anterior surface of the lateral epicondyle. It is to be noted that all four tendons are fused to each other and to the deep fascia near their origin from the humerus.

### Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis

This muscle arises from the common extensor origin on the front of the lateral epicondyle of the humerus, passes down behind and deep to its fellow longus (Fig. 2.39), and by a flattened tendon is inserted into the base of the third metacarpal. The lower part of the tendon is crossed by the three extensor muscles of the thumb.

**Nerve supply.** By a branch in the cubital fossa from the posterior interosseous nerve (C6, 7), before the nerve pierces the supinator muscle, though sometimes it arises from the superficial branch of the radial nerve.

**Action.** As a wrist extensor like its longus companion, it is indispensable in making a fist (p. 119). Note that it and the longus are inserted into the same metacarpals as flexor carpi radialis and compare the symmetry of insertion of flexor and extensor carpi ulnaris muscles.

### Extensor Digitorum

Arising from the common extensor origin, the muscle expands into a rounded belly in the middle of the forearm (Fig. 2.39), diverging from the three muscles on the radial side and separated from them by the emergence of the thumb extensors. The four tendons pass under the extensor retinaculum crowded together, overlying the tendon of extensor indicis. On the back of the hand, the tendons spread out towards the fingers. Commonly, the fourth tendon is fused with that to the ring finger, and reaches the little finger only by a tendinous band that passes across near the metacarpophalangeal joint. Other bands join adjacent tendons in a variable manner. The extensor expansions and their insertions into the phalanges are considered with the hand (p. 118).

**Nerve supply.** By the posterior interosseous nerve on the back of the forearm (C7, 8).

**Action.** It is an extensor of the digits and also assists in wrist extension; its action is discussed in detail on page 119.

**Test.** With the forearm in pronation and the fingers extended, the patient tries to keep the fingers extended at the metacarpophalangeal joints while pressure from the examiner on the proximal phalanges tries to flex these joints.

### Extensor Digiti Minimi

Arising in common with the extensor digitorum, the belly of the muscle separates after some distance (Fig. 2.39) and then becomes tendinous. Passing beneath the extensor retinaculum on the dorsal aspect of the radioulnar joint, the tendon usually splits into two which lie side by side on the fifth metacarpal bone as they pass to the little finger (Fig. 2.44). The tendon of extensor digitorum to the little finger commonly joins them by a band near the metacarpophalangeal joint. It becomes an expansion on the dorsum of the little finger, behaving as the other extensor expansions (p. 118). Do not be confused by the double tendon of extensor digiti minimi and think that one of the tendons belongs to extensor digitorum - it doesn't! The digitorum connection is the band near the metacarpophalangeal joint (Fig. 2.44).

**Nerve supply.** By the posterior interosseous nerve (C7, 8).

**Action.** It assists extensor digitorum in extension of the little finger and wrist joint; see page 119.

### Extensor Carpi Ulnaris

There is an origin from the common extensor tendon; as the muscle slopes downwards, it is completed by an aponeurotic sheet of origin from the subcutaneous border of the ulna (Fig. 2.39). This aponeurosis arises in common with that of flexor carpi ulnaris, the two passing in opposite directions into the extensor and flexor compartments. The tendon of the muscle lies in the groove beside the ulnar styloid as it passes on to be inserted into the base of the fifth metacarpal. Note the symmetry of insertion with flexor carpi ulnaris, which acts on the fifth metacarpal by way of the pisometacarpal ligament.

**Nerve supply.** By the posterior interosseous nerve (C6, 7) in the forearm.

**Action.** It is an extensor of the wrist and acts as a synergist during finger flexion. It is indispensable in making a fist (p. 119). Acting with flexor carpi ulnaris, it produces ulnar deviation (adduction) at the wrist.

**Test.** With the forearm pronated and the fingers extended, the wrist is extended and adducted against resistance. The muscle can be seen and felt in the upper forearm and the tendon palpated proximal to the head of the ulna.

### Anconeus

This muscle arises from a smooth facet on the lower extremity of the lateral epicondyle. It fans out to its insertion on the lateral side of the olecranon (Fig. 2.41). Its lateral fibers are vertical, in the axis of the forearm, but its upper fibers are horizontal, passing transversely across the forearm.

**Nerve supply.** By the radial nerve (C7, 8) by a branch that leaves the trunk in the radial groove and passes through triceps with the nerve to its medial head.

**Action.** The muscle produces the small amount of extension and abduction of the ulna that occurs during pronation (p. 96).

### Supinator

This muscle consists of two parts with different origins and passing in different directions (Fig. 2.40). The posterior interosseous nerve passes between these two parts as it leaves the cubital fossa to enter the back of the forearm.

The deep part of the supinator consists of fibers that arise from the supinator crest and fossa of the ulna and wrap horizontally around the radius to be inserted into the area between the anterior and posterior oblique lines. The superficial part arises from the distal border of the lateral epicondyle (just in front of anconeus), from the radial collateral (lateral) ligament of the elbow joint and from behind the supinator crest above abductor pollicis longus (Fig. 2.41). The fibers slope downwards to overlie the horizontal deep fibers and reach the radius just above the anterior oblique line.

**Nerve supply.** A branch to both parts of the supinator (C5, 6) leaves the posterior interosseous nerve in the cubital fossa before the nerve enters the muscle.

**Action.** Note that biceps is the powerful supinator of the forearm; supinator itself is to be regarded rather as a muscle that fixes the forearm in supination. Only when the elbow is completely extended is the supinator the prime mover for the action of supination, which is much weaker in this position. The muscle is too deep to be seen or palpated.

### Abductor Pollicis Longus

This arises from an oblique area on both bones of the forearm and the intervening interosseous membrane. Its radial origin lies immediately distal to the posterior oblique line. The ulnar origin is more proximal (Fig. 2.64). The muscle has separate superficial and deep parts and gives rise to a variable number of tendons. The deep part has a tendon that is mainly inserted into the trapezium, with a slip joining abductor pollicis brevis. The superficial part ends in one or more tendons attached to the base of the first metacarpal. There is a bursa between the tendons of the two parts.

**Action.** Its name indicates that it abducts the thumb, and it can assist in abducting and flexing the wrist, producing a trick flexion when other flexors are paralyzed. The disposition of the tendons suggests that the deep part of the muscle stabilizes the trapezium, upon which the first metacarpal can move.

**Test.** The thumb is abducted at the metacarpophalangeal joint against resistance. The tendon is seen and felt at the radial side of the snuffbox and on the radial side of the adjacent extensor pollicis brevis tendon.

### Extensor Pollicis Brevis

This arises below abductor pollicis longus from the radius and the adjacent interosseous membrane (Fig. 2.41). It spirals from the depths of the forearm around the radial extensors and brachioradialis, in contact with abductor pollicis longus, whose tendon it somewhat overlies on the radial border of the snuffbox. Its slender tendon lies with the tendon of abductor pollicis longus at the radial border of the snuffbox and then passes along the dorsal surface of the first metacarpal, and is inserted into the base of the proximal phalanx.

**Action.** It extends the carpometacarpal and metacarpophalangeal joints of the thumb (Fig. 2.42). It prevents flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joint when flexor pollicis longus is flexing the terminal phalanx, as in pinching index and thumb pads together (e.g., threading a needle).

**Test.** The thumb is extended at the metacarpophalangeal joint against resistance. The tendon is seen and felt at the radial side of the snuffbox and on the ulnar side of the adjacent abductor pollicis longus tendon.

### Extensor Pollicis Longus

This arises from the ulna just distal to abductor pollicis longus (Fig. 2.41). Thus it extends higher into the forearm than extensor pollicis brevis. It extends more distally also into the thumb, being inserted into the base of the distal phalanx. Its long tendon changes direction as it hooks around the dorsal tubercle of the radius (Lister's tubercle), whence it forms the ulnar boundary of the snuffbox (Figs 2.41 and 2.42). In this situation, the tendon is supplied with blood by local branches of the anterior interosseous artery. Their occlusion after Colles' fracture may lead to necrosis and spontaneous rupture of the tendon - hammer thumb. Such a rupture is not due to wearing through of the tendon as it grates over the fragments.

There is no extensor expansion on the thumb; the tendon of extensor pollicis longus is stabilized on the dorsum of the thumb by receiving expansions from abductor pollicis brevis and adductor pollicis.

**Action.** It extends the terminal phalanx of the thumb, and draws the thumb back from the opposed position (Figs 2.41 and 2.42), assisting in extension and abduction of the wrist.

**Test.** The thumb is extended at the interphalangeal joint against resistance. The tendon is seen and felt on the ulnar side of the snuffbox.

### Extensor Indicis

This small muscle arises from the ulna just distal to the former muscle (Fig. 2.41). Its tendon remains deep and passes across the lower end of the radius covered by the bunched-up tendons of extensor digitorum with which it shares a common synovial sheath. From here, it passes over the dorsal surface of the metacarpal bone of the index finger lying to the ulnar side of the digitorum tendon (Fig. 2.44). It joins the dorsal expansion of the index finger. Thus, like the dorsal surface of the little finger, the index finger has two tendons passing to it but they belong to different muscles: the indicis tendon is on the ulnar side of the digitorum tendon.

**Action.** It extends the index finger, as in pointing, as well as assisting extensor digitorum in this movement.

### Anatomical Snuffbox

If the thumb is fully extended, the extensor tendons are drawn up, and a concavity appears between them on the radial side of the wrist. The snuffbox lies between the extensor pollicis longus tendon on the ulnar side and the tendons of extensor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis longus on the radial side (Fig. 2.42). The cutaneous branches of the radial nerve cross these tendons, and they can be rolled on the tight tendon of extensor pollicis longus. The cephalic vein begins in the snuffbox, from the radial side of the dorsal venous network. The radial artery, deep to all three tendons, lies in the floor. Bony points readily palpable in the snuffbox are the radial styloid proximally, and the base of the thumb metacarpal distally; between the two, the scaphoid and trapezium can be felt.

### Posterior Interosseous Nerve

After passing through the supinator muscle between its two layers, the nerve appears in the extensor compartment of the forearm (Fig. 2.41) and passes downwards over the abductor pollicis longus origin. It now dips deeply to reach the interosseous membrane on which it passes between the muscles as far as the wrist joint. Here it ends in a small nodule from which branches supply the wrist joint and intercarpal ligaments. The nerve supplies the muscles which arise from the common extensor origin and the deep muscles of the extensor compartment. It is sensory to the interosseous membrane and periosteum of the radius and ulna, and to the dorsal periosteum and ligaments of the carpal bones. It has no cutaneous branch.

### Posterior Interosseous Artery

This vessel gains the extensor compartment by passing between the bones of the forearm above the interosseous membrane and below the oblique cord. It accompanies the posterior interosseous nerve and supplies the deep muscles of the extensor compartment. At the lower border of extensor indicis, this small vessel is generally exhausted. Distal to this level, the arterial supply of the extensor compartment is furnished by the anterior interosseous artery, which pierces the interosseous membrane just above the upper border of pronator quadratus (Fig. 2.33). The anterior interosseous artery then passes distally to end on the back of the wrist in the dorsal carpal anastomosis.

### Extensor Retinaculum

The extensor retinaculum is a ribbon-like band, less than 2.5 cm wide, which lies obliquely across the extensor surface of the wrist joint (Fig. 2.44). Its proximal attachment is to the radius at the anterolateral border above the styloid process, at the lateral border of pronator quadratus. It is not attached to the ulna; its upper border passes by the styloid process of the ulna. It is attached to the pisiform and triquetral bones. It is a thickening in the deep fascia of the forearm. Immediately proximal to it, the deep fascia is attached to the styloid process of the ulna but the oblique fibers which pass from here to the radial side are not attached to the radius, being held away from the bone by the extensor muscles of the thumb.

If the extensor retinaculum were attached to both bones of the forearm, it would be over 30% longer in pronation than in supination, as is shown by measurement on the bones. Such elongation is obviously not possible and, in fact, the retinaculum, attached to the radius and carpus and free from the ulna, maintains a constant tension throughout the whole range of pronation and supination, while the radius and carpus move together around the lower end of the ulna. Thus the retinaculum holds down the extensor tendons, like a wrist strap, in all positions of the forearm bones.

From the deep surface of the extensor retinaculum, fibrous septa pass to the bones of the forearm, dividing the extensor tunnel into six compartments. The most lateral compartment lies over the lateral surface of the radius at its distal extremity, and through it pass the tendons of abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis, each usually lying in a separate synovial sheath. The next compartment extends as far as the dorsal tubercle, and conveys the tendons of the radial extensors of the wrist (longus and brevis) each lying in a separate synovial sheath (see Fig. 2.64 for these and other grooves on the radius and ulna). The groove on the ulnar side of the radial tubercle lodges the tendon of extensor pollicis longus, which lies within its own compartment invested with a synovial sheath. Between this groove and the ulnar border of the radius is a shallow depression in which all four tendons of extensor digitorum lie, crowded together over the tendon of extensor indicis. All five tendons in this compartment are invested with a common synovial sheath. The next compartment lies over the radioulnar joint and transmits the double tendon of extensor minimi digiti in a synovial sheath. Lastly, the groove near the base of the ulnar styloid transmits the tendon of extensor carpi ulnaris (in its synovial sheath) which then passes into its own compartment on the dorsal surface of the carpus to reach the fifth metacarpal bone.

## Hand

The hand includes the wrist whose skeleton is the carpus or carpal bones, but the word wrist is often used to include the lower ends of the radius and ulna. The back of the hand is the dorsum or dorsal surface (extensor surface), while the palm or palmar surface is the flexor surface.

The hand of man differs from the manus of other creatures in being a grasping mechanism combining great strength with finely controlled accuracy and at the same time serving as the chief tactile organ. Apart from the free mobility of the thumb, its component parts differ little from those of the foot; indeed their similarity is very striking (p. 237). The great difference lies in the richness of the cortical connections, both sensory and motor, in the case of the hand. Over half of the fibers of the corticospinal tract are concerned with upper limb movements, which are usually directed to getting the hand into the required position and putting it to work. The anatomical structures to be studied in the hand differ not at all between the unskilled laborer, the skilled craftsman, and the artist. They comprise the same four layers as in the foot (p. 197). Beneath the skin of the palm lies the strong palmar aponeurosis. Next lie the short muscles of the thumb and little finger and the long flexor tendons. More deeply is the adductor muscle of the thumb, then the metacarpal bones with their interosseous muscles. The long flexor tendons supply the power of the grip; the small muscles of the hand are responsible for adjusting the position and carrying out the finer skilled movements of the digits. In contrast to the palm, the dorsum of the hand has little but skin and sinew covering the bones.

## Dorsum of the Hand

The skin of the dorsum is loose and can be picked up from the underlying tendons and moved freely over them except in a very podgy hand.

The cutaneous innervation of the dorsum is by the terminal branches of the radial nerve and the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve (Fig. 2.43). They share the hand and its digits 3½ to 1½, though a distribution 2½ to 2½ is not uncommon. The ends of the nerves pass round to the dorsum of each digit, where they stop short of the nail beds (which are supplied 3½ to 1½ by the nerves of the flexor skin, the median and the superficial branch of the ulnar nerves).

Large veins forming the dorsal venous network (or arch) lie beneath the skin; they drain from the palm, so that the pressure of gripping does not impede venous return. The network lies superficial to the extensor tendons, proximal to the metacarpal heads, and drains on the radial side into the cephalic vein and on the ulnar side into the basilic vein.

Beyond the extensor retinaculum, the extensors of the wrist (two radial and one ulnar) are inserted into the proximal part of the hand, at the bases of their respective metacarpal bones. Lying more superficially, the extensor tendons of the fingers fan out over the dorsum of the hand, attached to the deep fascia of this region and interconnected near the metacarpal heads by a variable arrangement of oblique fibrous bands (intertendinous connections) (Fig. 2.44). The deep fascia and the subjacent extensor tendons roof in a subfascial space that extends across the whole width of the hand. Passing to the index finger are the tendons of extensor digitorum and extensor indicis lying together, while the tendon of extensor digiti minimi to the little finger is usually split longitudinally into two (Fig. 2.44). The two tendons over the second metacarpal bone thus belong to two separate muscles, while the two tendons usually seen over the fifth metacarpal belong to only one muscle. The tendon of extensor digitorum to the little finger lies over the metacarpal bone of the ring finger.

The posterior carpal arch is an arterial anastomosis between the radial, ulnar, and anterior interosseous arteries. It lies on the back of the carpus and sends dorsal metacarpal arteries distally in the intermetacarpal spaces, deep to the long tendons. These split at the webs to supply the dorsal aspects of adjacent fingers. They communicate through the interosseous spaces with the palmar metacarpal branches of the deep palmar arch. Companion veins bring blood from the palm into the dorsal venous network mentioned above.

## Wrist Joint

This is a synovial joint whose bony surfaces are formed proximally by the distal surface of the radius and the attached articular disc of the distal radioulnar joint (p. 95), and distally by the scaphoid, lunate, and triquetral bones. The triangular fibrocartilage, which holds the lower ends of the radius and ulna together, separates the wrist (radiocarpal) joint from the distal radioulnar joint. It does not transmit thrust from the hand. Examine the lower end of the radius. The triangular facet whose apex is the styloid process is for articulation with the scaphoid. The rectangular area next to it is for the lunate. The triquetral is adjacent to the disc and the ulnar collateral ligament; only in extreme degrees of adduction may the triquetral make contact with the radius. It is a common fallacy to think that the triquetral only takes part in the joint in extreme adduction. The fallacy is in thinking that taking part in the joint is the same as articulating with the radius; the triquetral is always part of the joint. A simple capsule surrounds the joint and is thickened on the radial and ulnar sides by collateral ligaments, and in general is much thicker in front than behind. Strong ligaments run transversely from the lower end of the radius to the lunate, forming the palmar radiocarpal ligament.

**Nerve supply.** By twigs from the posterior interosseous (radial) and anterior interosseous (median) nerves.

**Movements.** Movements at the joint are flexion and extension, adduction (ulnar deviation) and abduction (radial deviation). These four movements occurring in sequence produce circumduction. Some of the movement of flexion and extension is always accompanied by similar movement at the midcarpal joint (p. 120). Of the total range of flexion (about 80°), a greater proportion occurs at the midcarpal joint; in extension (60°), there is a greater proportion at the wrist joint itself. The four movements are carried out by combinations of muscle groups. Thus flexion is produced by flexor carpi radialis and flexor carpi ulnaris as prime movers, by palmaris longus and the flexors of fingers and thumb and abductor pollicis longus. Extension is produced by the radial extensors (longus and brevis) and the ulnar extensor as prime movers assisted on occasion by the extensors of fingers and thumb. Abduction (limited to about 15° because of the projection of the radial styloid) is carried out by abductor pollicis longus and, when the wrist is displaced from the midline, by flexor carpi radialis and the two radial extensors acting together. Similarly, adduction (60°) is brought about by simultaneous contraction of flexor and extensor carpi ulnaris. In the rest position, the axis of the metacarpus (third metacarpal) is not in line with the axis of the forearm. With the supinated forearm by the side, the axis of the hand is parallel with the humerus, thus compensating for the carrying angle at the elbow. Lateral movements of the wrist are symmetrical about this axis, but they are, ipso facto, not symmetrical about the axis of the forearm, from which the metacarpus can be brought further into ulnar adduction than into radial abduction. In the former movement, there is some gliding of the carpal bones across the lower end of the radius but in the latter, the carpal bones, rather, rotate each about its own axis.

It is worth noting that the most usual movement of the wrist is one of extension combined with radial abduction, and of flexion combined with ulnar adduction. Hammering in a nail illustrates this movement, and exactly similar movements of the wrist, in the working position of the forearm, occur in a host of everyday acts like eating and drinking, washing and dressing, writing, etc. Indeed, pure flexion-extension and abduction-adduction are unusual movements. Since extension-abduction is an antigravity movement in the normal working position, this may explain the presence of two radial extensors where one serves on the ulnar side, and there is only one flexor each for radial and ulnar sides.

**Surgical approach.** The usual approach is on the dorsal surface, on the ulnar side of the tendon of extensor pollicis longus, the tendons of extensor digitorum and extensor indicis being displaced medially to expose the capsule. There are no major vessels or nerves in this region. Needle puncture of the joint is carried out between the tendons of extensor pollicis longus and extensor digitorum; the styloid process of the radius is palpated in the snuffbox to indicate the level of the joint line.

## Palm of the Hand

The skin of the palm is characterized by flexure creases (the lines of the palm) and the papillary ridges, or fingerprints, which occupy the whole of the flexor surface. Perhaps the latter serve to improve the grip; certainly they increase the surface area. Sweat glands abound. The little palmaris brevis muscle is attached to the dermis; it is part of the panniculus carnosus (p. 3). It lies across the base of the hypothenar eminence and is the only muscle supplied by the superficial branch of the ulnar nerve. It may improve the grip by steadying the skin on the ulnar side of the palm.

The cutaneous innervation of the palm is mainly by the superficial and palmar branches of the ulnar nerve (p. 114) and by the median nerve and its palmar branch (pp. 111 and 94), probably supplemented proximally by the very ends of the medial and lateral cutaneous nerves of the forearm (p. 94) and over the base of the thenar eminence by the radial nerve (p. 94).

### Palmar Aponeurosis

This strongly unyielding ligament is phylogenetically the degenerated tendon of palmaris longus (p. 89). It extends, in continuity with the tendon, from the distal border of the flexor retinaculum, whence it fans out in a thick sheet towards the bases of the fingers. It divides into four slips, one for each finger. Each slip gives off superficial fibers that insert into the skin in the region of the crease at the base of the finger, while the main part divides into two bands over the proximal end of the fibrous flexor sheath; they are inserted into the deep transverse ligament of the palm, and into the bases of the proximal phalanges and the fibrous flexor sheaths (Fig. 2.45). Some strands from the aponeurosis pass up on each side of the finger. When the fingers are forcibly extended, the soft tissues of the palm can be seen bulging in the three intervals between the four slips, just proximal to the interdigital webs.

Over the hypothenar muscles, the deep fascia is much thinner than the palmar aponeurosis and it is thinnest of all over the thenar muscles. This is in keeping with the increased mobility of the metacarpal bone of the thumb (note that the plantar aponeurosis over the big toe muscles is thick; the first metatarsal has very little freedom of movement). The function of the palmar aponeurosis is purely mechanical. It gives firm attachment to the skin of the palm to improve the grip, and it protects the underlying tendons. Contraction of the aponeurosis and its digital slips in Dupuytren's contracture results in a fixed flexion of the fingers concerned (usually the ring and little fingers).

### Flexor Retinaculum

The flexor retinaculum is a strong band that is attached on the radial side to the tubercle of the scaphoid and ridge of the trapezium and on the ulnar side to the pisiform and hook of the hamate. Note that these four bony points are all palpable in the living hand and that the pisiform is the only carpal bone to give attachments to both the flexor and extensor retinacula. There is a further attachment on the radial side, where a deep partition bridges the groove on the trapezium. The fibro-osseous tunnel so formed transmits the tendon of flexor carpi radialis and its synovial sheath (Fig. 2.46).

The muscles of the thenar and hypothenar eminences arise from the retinaculum and several structures pass across it. The tendon of palmaris longus is fused to the midline of the retinaculum as it passes distally to expand into the palmar aponeurosis. The ulnar nerve lies on the retinaculum alongside the pisiform bone, with the ulnar artery on its radial side (Fig. 2.29). Both are bridged over by a slender band of tissue officially called the superficial part of the retinaculum, forming a small canal (of Guyon) that may occasionally cause compression of the nerve. The nerve divides into a superficial (cutaneous) and a deep (muscular) branch at the distal border of the retinaculum; the deep branch is accompanied by a small deep branch of the artery. Near the ulnar side of the palmaris longus tendon, the small palmar branch of the ulnar nerve enters the palm, while on the radial side of the tendon, the palmar branch of the median nerve and the superficial palmar branch of the radial artery cross the retinaculum. The radial side of the retinaculum is pierced proximally by the tendon of flexor carpi radialis over the scaphoid; further distally, the tendon lies deeply in its fibro-osseous tunnel on the trapezium.

### Carpal Tunnel

The carpus is deeply concave on its flexor surface. This bony gutter is converted into the carpal tunnel by the flexor retinaculum (Fig. 2.46). The long flexors of the fingers and thumb run through the tunnel. The four tendons of the superficial flexor are separate from each other and pass through in two rows, middle and ring finger tendons lying in front of index and little finger tendons. The tendons of flexor digitorum profundus, on the other hand, lie all on the same plane deep on the carpal bones; but here only the tendon to the index finger is yet separated, the other three being adherent to each other as they run in the tunnel, and not splitting free until they gain the palm (Fig. 2.31). All eight tendons of the superficial and deep flexors share a common synovial sheath. It does not invest them completely, but is reflected from their radial sides, where arteries of supply gain access to the tendons. It is as though the tendons had been invaginated into the sheath from the radial side (Fig. 2.46). The tendon of flexor pollicis longus lies in its own synovial sheath as it passes through the fibro-osseous tunnel beside the trapezium. The median nerve passes beneath the flexor retinaculum on the lateral side of flexor digitorum superficialis (middle finger tendon), between it and flexor carpi radialis. For the carpal tunnel syndrome, see page 111.

### Thenar Eminence

The thenar eminence is made up of the three short thumb muscles whose origin is essentially from the flexor retinaculum (Fig. 2.47). The most radial of these is abductor pollicis brevis. It arises from the flexor retinaculum and the tubercle of the scaphoid and is inserted into the radial side of the base of the proximal phalanx and the tendon of extensor pollicis longus (Fig. 2.42).

Flexor pollicis brevis lies to the ulnar side of the abductor. It arises from the flexor retinaculum and adjacent trapezium and is inserted into the radial sesamoid of the thumb and so to the radial border of the proximal phalanx. Irregularities of origin are fairly common and have been given many names. The least confusing descriptive nomenclature is to call any fibers that are inserted into the radial sesamoid flexor pollicis brevis, no matter what their origin; fibers inserted into the ulnar sesamoid should not be named flexor pollicis brevis, but considered part of either adductor pollicis or the first palmar interosseous.

Opponens pollicis lies deep to the former two muscles (Fig. 2.50). It arises from the flexor retinaculum and the adjacent trapezium and is inserted into the whole of the radial border of the metacarpal bone of the thumb (Fig. 2.50).

**Nerve supplies.** All three muscles are supplied by the muscular (recurrent) branch of the median nerve (mainly T1 but with some component from C8), but it is necessary to qualify this simple statement. The nerve supply of flexor pollicis brevis is subject to more variation than that of any other muscle in the body. It may be from the muscular branch of the median nerve or the deep branch of the ulnar nerve, or it may have a double supply from both nerves. The opponens usually has a double supply, and there may be other anomalies including even (though very rarely) the supply of all three by the ulnar nerve alone. All these possibilities must be kept in mind when testing for nerve injuries (p. 127).

**Actions.** The actions of the three muscles are indicated by their names. The abductor abducts the thumb (moving it in a plane at right angles to the palm), and it also abducts the proximal phalanx at the metacarpophalangeal joint and slightly rotates the phalanx. It is thus an indispensable aid in opposition of the thumb (see below). By the slip to the tendon of extensor pollicis longus, it can assist in extension of the thumb. The flexor flexes the proximal phalanx and draws the thumb across the palm, and the opponens opposes the metacarpal of the thumb (see below).

**Tests.** For abductor pollicis brevis, the thumb is abducted against resistance, at right angles to the palm; the muscle can be seen and felt. For opponens, the thumb is brought against resistance towards the base of the little finger and the thumb palpated against the metacarpal. The presence of the long flexor and the variability of the nerve supply makes testing flexor pollicis brevis of doubtful value.

### Flexion and Opposition of the Thumb

Hold the hand in the neutral position of complete relaxation. Note that the plane of the four fingernails is at right angles to the plane of the thumbnail. Flexion of the thumb across the palm maintains the plane of the thumbnail; opposition, on the other hand, rotates the metacarpal and phalanges in such manner that the thumbnail lies parallel with the nail of the opposed finger, as thumb and finger lie in contact pad to pad. Rotation of the metacarpal at its saddle-shaped joint with the trapezium is produced by the skew pull of the opponens muscle, assisted by the abductor brevis, which abducts and slightly rotates the proximal phalanx at the metacarpophalangeal joint.

Confirm this by observing the movement in your own thumb. At rest, the thumb phalanges are in line with their own metacarpal bone, but in full opposition, there is notable angulation at the metacarpophalangeal joint. This abduction carries the pad of the thumb still farther towards the ulnar side of the hand. The slight rotation of the proximal phalanx produced at the same time by abductor pollicis brevis aids in bringing the pad of the thumb opposite to the pad of the opposed finger.

### Hypothenar Eminence

In name, the muscles that form the hypothenar eminence on the ulnar side of the palm are similar to the three thenar muscles. Abductor digiti minimi is the most ulnar of the group (Fig. 2.47); it arises from the pisiform bone and flexor retinaculum and is inserted into the ulnar side of the base of the proximal phalanx and into the extensor expansion. A sesamoid bone is common in its tendon. Flexor digiti minimi brevis (Fig. 2.47) arises from the flexor retinaculum and is inserted into the base of the proximal phalanx. Opponens digiti minimi (Fig. 2.50) also arises from the flexor retinaculum and the hook of the hamate and is inserted into the ulnar border of the fifth metacarpal bone.

**Nerve supplies.** By the deep branch of the ulnar nerve (C8, T1).

**Actions.** All three hypothenar muscles help to cup the palm and assist in the grip on a large object.

### Superficial Palmar Arch

This is an arterial arcade (Fig. 2.48) that lies superficial to everything in the palmar compartment, i.e., in contact with the deep surface of the palmar aponeurosis. It is formed by the direct continuation of the ulnar artery beyond the flexor retinaculum but it is badly named, for in two-thirds of hands it has a hockey-stick shape and is not a complete arch (Fig. 2.48). If it is complete, it becomes continuous with the superficial palmar branch of the radial artery. This branch may pass superficial to or through the thenar muscles. The arch lies across the center of the palm, level with the distal border of the outstretched thumb web. From its convexity, a palmar digital artery passes to the ulnar side of the little finger, and three common palmar digital arteries run distally to the webs between the fingers where each vessel divides into proper palmar digital arteries that supply adjacent fingers. The thumb side of the index finger and the thumb itself are not supplied from the superficial arch since they receive branches from the radial artery.

Lying immediately deep to the superficial palmar arch are the common palmar digital nerves. They pass distally to the webs, between the slips of the palmar aponeurosis and divide like the arteries (but proximal to the arterial divisions) into proper palmar digital nerves. Here the nerves lie superficially; they are destined essentially for the sensitive pads at the fingertips. They end dorsally by supplying all five nail beds (Fig. 2.49).

### Median Nerve in the Hand

The median nerve enters the palm beneath the flexor retinaculum (Fig. 2.48) and divides into three branches. The medial branch divides into two and supplies palmar skin, the cleft and adjacent sides of ring and middle fingers and the cleft and adjacent sides of middle and index fingers (Fig. 2.49). The latter branch supplies the second lumbrical muscle. The lateral branch supplies palmar skin, the radial side of the index, the whole of the thumb and its web on the palmar surface and distal part of the dorsal surface. The branch to the index supplies the first lumbrical.

The highly important muscular (recurrent) branch curls upwards from around the distal border of the flexor retinaculum to supply the thenar muscles (p. 109). To reach these muscles, the nerve passes superficial to the tendon of flexor pollicis longus. Incision of the sheath will endanger the nerve if the cut is not kept sufficiently distal.

In the tightly crowded flexor tunnel, the median nerve can be compressed, especially by long-continued swelling in the synovial sheaths. The symptoms include wasting and weakness of the thenar muscles (with loss of power of opposition of the thumb) and anesthesia over three and a half digits on the thumb side of the hand. There is no anesthesia over the thenar eminence itself, for this area of skin is supplied by the palmar branch of the median nerve, or occasionally by the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm. Either of these nerves enters the palm superficial to the retinaculum, and so escapes compression. Surgical division of the flexor retinaculum is the treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome.

The carpal tunnel syndrome must be distinguished from median nerve damage at a higher level. In the latter case, the palmar cutaneous branch will be affected and, in addition, weakness of the relevant flexor muscles in the forearm (e.g., flexor pollicis longus) is a notable feature. In the carpal tunnel syndrome, the terminal phalanx of the thumb can be flexed with normal power, but with higher lesions, this power is lost.

### Lumbricals

In the palm, the tendons of flexor digitorum superficialis immediately overlie those of flexor digitorum profundus. From the latter tendons, the four lumbrical muscles arise. The superficial tendons overlie the profundus tendons as they pass, in pairs, into the fibrous flexor sheaths of the fingers. Their synovial sheaths are considered on page 117.

From each of the four profundus tendons, a lumbrical muscle passes along the radial side of the metacarpophalangeal joint (Fig. 2.47). On the palmar surface of the deep transverse metacarpal ligament, each develops a tendon which runs in a fibrous lumbrical canal to reach the extensor expansion on the dorsum of the first phalanx.

**Nerve supply.** Characteristically, the two ulnar lumbricals are innervated by the ulnar nerve and the two radial lumbricals by the median nerve (C8, T1). The proportion of ulnar and median distribution to the lumbricals follows that of the parent bellies of the tendons in the forearm (p. 91). It is interesting to note, though impossible to explain, that lumbricals supplied by the ulnar nerve are bicipital, each arising by two heads from adjacent profundus tendons, while those supplied by the median nerve are unicipital and arise from one tendon only.

### Adductor Pollicis

This muscle lies deeply in the palm (Figs 2.47 and 2.50) in contact with the metacarpals and interossei; it is not classified as part of the thenar eminence. The transverse head arises from the whole length of the palmar border of the third metacarpal (Fig. 2.50) whence the muscle converges, fan-shaped, to the ulnar sesamoid of the thumb, and so to the ulnar side of the base of the proximal phalanx and the tendon of extensor pollicis longus. There is an oblique head (Fig. 2.50) that arises from the bases of the second and third metacarpals and their adjoining carpal bones (trapezoid and capitate) by a crescentic origin that embraces the insertion of flexor carpi radialis. The fibers of this head run edge to edge with the transverse head and converge with it on the ulnar sesamoid.

**Nerve supply.** By the deep branch of the ulnar nerve (C8, T1).

**Action.** To approximate the thumb to the index finger, whatever the original position of the thumb.

### Radial Artery in the Hand

The radial artery leaves the lower end of the radius and slopes across the snuffbox over the trapezium and so passes into the hand between the two heads of the first dorsal interosseous muscle (Fig. 2.42). Lying now between this muscle and adductor pollicis, it gives off two large branches. The arteria radialis indicis passes distally between the two muscles to emerge on the radial side of the index finger, which it supplies. The princeps pollicis artery passes distally along the metacarpal bone of the thumb and divides into its two palmar digital branches at the metacarpal head. The main trunk of the radial artery now passes into the palm between the oblique and transverse heads of adductor pollicis to form the deep palmar arch (Fig. 2.33).

### Deep Palmar Arch

The deep palmar arch is an arterial arcade formed by the terminal branch of the radial artery anastomosing with the deep branch of the ulnar artery. Unlike the superficial arch (p. 110), the deep arch is usually complete. The radial artery gains the palm by passing between the oblique and transverse heads of adductor pollicis (Fig. 2.50), and runs across the palm at a level about 1 cm proximal to the superficial arch. The deep branch of the ulnar nerve lies within the concavity of the deep arch. From its convexity, three palmar metacarpal arteries pass distally and in the region of the metacarpal heads they anastomose with the common palmar digital branches of the superficial arch. Branches perforate the interosseous spaces to anastomose with the dorsal metacarpal arteries. Accompanying veins drain most of the blood from the palm into the dorsal venous network (p. 104). Branches from the anterior carpal arch also anastomose with the deep arch.

For a visual assessment of the contribution of the radial and ulnar arteries in the blood supply of the hand, make a clenched fist and occlude the radial and ulnar arteries. When the fist is released, the skin of the palm is seen to be pale, but color should return rapidly on the release of either one of the arteries. If there is an obvious delay after releasing the ulnar artery compared with the radial, it suggests that the radial supply is dominant and that procedures that might damage the radial artery (such as cannulation) should be avoided.

### Ulnar Nerve in the Hand

The ulnar nerve leaves the forearm by emerging from beneath the tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris and passes distally on the flexor retinaculum alongside the radial border of the pisiform bone. Here it divides into superficial and deep branches (Fig. 2.48). The superficial branch supplies palmaris brevis and is then carried on as the digital nerves to the ulnar one and a half fingers. The small palmar branch supplies skin over the hypothenar muscles. The deep branch passes deeply into the palm between the heads of origin of flexor and abductor digiti minimi and through the origin of opponens digiti minimi (Fig. 2.50) to lie on the hook of the hamate, whose distal border it indents with a shallow groove. Passing down to the interossei, it arches deeply in the palm within the concavity of the deep palmar arch. It gives motor branches to the three hypothenar muscles, the two lumbricals on the ulnar side, all the interossei, and both heads of adductor pollicis. Compare the ulnar nerve in the hand with the lateral plantar in the foot (p. 203). The cutaneous distribution is identical, but in the foot, the superficial branch of the lateral plantar nerve, unlike that of the ulnar, supplies three muscles, and the deep branch supplies three instead of only two lumbricals.

### Interossei

The interossei are in two groups, palmar and dorsal (Fig. 2.51). The former are small and arise from only one (their own) metacarpal bone; the latter are larger and arise from the adjacent metacarpal bones of the space in which they lie. The palmar interossei are only seen from the palmar aspect of the interosseous spaces, but the dorsal can be seen from both dorsal and palmar aspects. It is easy to recall the attachments of the interossei by appreciating their functional requirements. The formula PAD and DAB indicates that palmar adduct and dorsal abduct the fingers relative to the axis of the palm, which is the third metacarpal bone and middle finger (in the foot, the axis passes through the second digit).

The palmar interossei adduct the fingers. Thus the thumb requires no palmar interosseous, already possessing its own powerful adductor pollicis muscle. Nevertheless, a few fibers are sometimes found passing from the base of the metacarpal of the thumb to the base of its proximal phalanx; when present, these fibers represent the first palmar interosseous muscle. Similarly, the middle finger has no palmar interosseous; it cannot be adducted towards itself. The second, third, and fourth palmar interossei arise from the middle finger side of the metacarpal bone of the index, ring, and little fingers and are inserted into the same side of the extensor expansion and proximal phalanx of each respective finger.

The dorsal interossei, more powerful than the palmar, abduct their own fingers away from the midline of the palm (Fig. 2.51). The thumb and little finger already possess their proper abducting muscles in the thenar and hypothenar eminences. Thus there are dorsal interossei attached only to the index, middle, and ring fingers. In the case of the index and ring fingers, they are inserted into the side of the finger away from the middle finger. In the case of the middle finger itself, a dorsal interosseous is present on each side. All four dorsal interossei arise by two heads, one from each bone bounding the interosseous space.

The tendons of palmar and dorsal interossei all pass on the posterior side of the deep transverse metacarpal ligament to reach their distal attachments. They are inserted chiefly into the appropriate side of the extensor expansion (like the lumbricals) (p. 118), but partly also into the base of the proximal phalanx (to which the lumbricals are not attached).

**Nerve supply.** All the interossei are supplied by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve (C8, T1), but an occasional variant is for the first dorsal interosseous to be supplied by the median nerve.

### Fibrous Flexor Sheaths

From the metacarpal heads to the distal phalanges, all five digits are provided with a strong unyielding fibrous sheath in which the flexor tendons lie (Fig. 2.47). In the thumb, the fibrous sheath is occupied by the tendon of flexor pollicis longus alone. In the four fingers, the sheaths are occupied by the tendons of the superficial and deep flexors, the superficial splitting to spiral around the deep within the sheath. The proximal ends of the fibrous sheaths of the fingers receive the insertions of the four slips of the palmar aponeurosis. The sheaths are strong and dense over the phalanges, weak and lax over the joints.

### Synovial Sheaths of Flexor Tendons

In the carpal tunnel, the flexor tendons are invested with synovial sheaths that extend proximally into the lower part of the forearm and proceed distally to a varying extent (Fig. 2.52). On the tendon of flexor pollicis longus, the sheath extends from above the flexor retinaculum to the insertion of the tendon into the terminal phalanx of the thumb. The tendons of the superficial and deep flexors are together invested with a common synovial sheath that is incomplete on the radial side. This common sheath commences a short distance above the wrist and extends down into the palm. On the little finger, it is continued along the whole extent of the flexor tendons to the terminal phalanx. Next to the first, the fifth metacarpal is the most mobile bone of the palm. The common flexor sheath ends over the remaining three sets of tendons just distal to the flexor retinaculum. In the case of a very mobile fourth metacarpal, the sheath may extend to the terminal phalanx of the ring finger, like that of the little finger in the average hand. The common flexor sheath communicates at the level of the wrist with the sheath of flexor pollicis longus in 50% of individuals. In the index, middle, and ring fingers, where the common sheath ends beyond the flexor retinaculum, a separate synovial sheath lines the fibrous flexor sheath over the phalanges. There is thus a short distance of bare tendon for the index, middle, and ring fingers in the middle of the palm. It is from this situation that the lumbrical muscles arise. The fourth lumbrical obliterates the synovial sheath along its origin from the tendon to the little finger.

### Palmar Spaces

The palmar aponeurosis, fanning out from the distal border of the flexor retinaculum, is triangular in shape. From each of its two sides, a fibrous septum dips downwards into the palm. That from the ulnar border is attached to the palmar border to the fifth metacarpal bone. Medial to it is the hypothenar space, not important surgically since it contains no long flexor tendons, but encloses only the hypothenar muscles. The remaining part of the palm is divided into two spaces by the septum that dips in from the radial border of the palmar aponeurosis to the palmar surface of the middle metacarpal bone. This septum lies obliquely and separates the thenar space on its radial side from the midpalmar space beneath the palmar aponeurosis. Normally, the septum passes deeply between the flexor tendons of the index and middle fingers, i.e., the flexor tendons of the index finger overlie the thenar space. In some cases, however, the septum passes deeply between the index tendons and the first lumbrical; in these cases, the first lumbrical overlies the thenar space whilst the flexor tendons to the index finger overlie the midpalmar space.

The midpalmar space is limited superficially by a thin fascia that lies deep to the common synovial sheath and the flexor tendons (Fig. 2.52). The space is floored in by interossei and metacarpals of the third and fourth spaces. Its sides are formed by the septa dipping in from the borders of the palmar aponeurosis. Infection in the space can readily break into the connective tissue canals surrounding the ulnar three lumbricals, so that for practical purposes, the space may be considered to be continuous distally with these lumbrical canals. Proximally, the space is closed by the firm attachment of the parietal layer of the common flexor synovial sheath to the walls of the carpal flexor tunnel.

The thenar space lies on the thumb side of the septum that joins the border of the palmar aponeurosis to the palmar border of the third metacarpal bone (Fig. 2.52). It always contains the first lumbrical muscle, into whose canal infection can spread, as in the midpalmar space, and generally also it is overlaid by the flexor tendons to the index finger. In the palm, it is bounded posteriorly by adductor pollicis, but around the distal border of this muscle, in the web of the thumb, it is continuous with the slit-like space that lies between adductor pollicis and the first dorsal interosseous muscle. The thenar space is closed at the wrist, in a manner similar to the midpalmar space, by fusion of the parietal layer of the synovial sheaths with the walls of the carpal tunnel.

### Web Spaces

The three web spaces of the palm lie between the four slips of attachment of the palmar aponeurosis. From the skin edge, they may be said to extend proximally as far as the metacarpophalangeal joints, a distance of about 4 cm. Between the palmar and dorsal layers of the skin lie the superficial and deep transverse ligaments of the palm, the digital vessels and nerves, and the tendons of the interossei and lumbricals on their way to the extensor expansions. The web is filled in with a packing of loose fibrofatty tissue.

The superficial transverse metacarpal ligament lies beneath the palmar skin across the free margins of the webs (Fig. 2.45). Its fibers lie transversely in a flat band, best developed on the radial side and thinning out over the more mobile little finger. Its two ends, and the parts that lie across the fibrous flexor sheaths, are continued along the sides of the fingers, tethering the skin to the phalanges. The ligament supports the fold of skin at the web (it is well developed in quadrupeds whose forefeet are webbed). The digital vessels and nerves lie immediately deep to the ligament, a point to be remembered in making web incisions for palmar space infections. Here the nerves lie on the palmar side of the arteries. The lumbrical tendon lies beneath the vessels, passing distally within the lumbrical canal into the radial side of the dorsal expansion of its own finger. The deep transverse metacarpal ligament (Fig. 2.47) joins the palmar ligaments of the metacarpophalangeal joints (p. 120). It lies 3 cm proximal to the superficial transverse ligament.

The interosseous tendons lie on the dorsal side of the deep transverse ligament; the lumbrical tendons are on the palmar side (Fig. 2.47).

The web of the thumb lacks both superficial and deep transverse ligaments, a factor contributing to the mobility of the thumb. The deep fascia passes across from palmar to dorsal surfaces of the web and beneath it lie the transverse head of adductor pollicis and the first dorsal interosseous muscle. From the slit-like space between them emerge the radialis indicis and princeps pollicis arteries. Each hugs its own digit and the central part of the web can be incised without risk to either vessel. The thenar space lies beneath the deep fascia on the palmar surface of adductor pollicis; the first lumbrical passes through the space to the radial side of the index finger.

### Pulp Spaces

The pulp spaces are on the palmar side of the tips of the fingers and thumb. They contain fatty tissue that is divided into numerous compartments by fibrous septa that pass between the distal phalanx and the skin. Terminal branches of the digital vessels course through the spaces and some of them supply the end of the distal phalanx (but not the epiphysis); infection of the pulp spaces may occlude these vessels and cause necrosis of the end of the bone. The pulp space is limited proximally by the firm adherence of the skin of the distal flexion crease to the underlying tissue; this prevents pulp infection from spreading proximally along the finger.

### Flexor Tendons of the Fingers

The tendon of flexor digitorum superficialis enters the fibrous flexor sheath on the palmar surface of the tendon of flexor digitorum profundus. It divides into two halves, which flatten a little and spiral around the profundus tendon and meet on its deep surface in a chiasma (a partial decussation). This forms a tendinous bed in which lies the profundus tendon. Distal to the chiasma, the superficialis tendon is attached to the sides of the whole shaft of the middle phalanx (Fig. 2.53).

The profundus tendon enters the fibrous sheath deep to the superficialis tendon, then lies superficial to the partial decussation of the latter, before passing distally to reach the base of the terminal phalanx. In the flexor sheath, both tendons are invested by a common synovial sheath that possesses parietal and visceral layers. Each tendon receives blood vessels from the palmar surface of the phalanges. The vessels are invested in synovial membrane. These vascular synovial folds are the vincula, and each tendon possesses two, the short and long (Fig. 2.54). The profundus tendon has its short vinculum in the angle close to its insertion. Its long vinculum passes from the tendon between the two halves of the superficialis tendon (proximal to the chiasma) to the palmar surface of the proximal phalanx. The superficialis tendon has a short vinculum near its attachment into the sides of the middle phalanx. The long vinculum of the superficialis tendon is double, each half of the tendon possessing a vinculum just distal to its first division, passing down to the palmar surface of the proximal phalanx. The short vincula, attached to the capsules of the interphalangeal joints, serve to pull these out of harm's way during flexion. Only the long vinculum is vascular.

### Extensor Tendons of the Fingers

The extensor tendons to the four fingers have a characteristic insertion (Fig. 2.54). Passing across the metacarpophalangeal joint, the tendon is partly adherent to the articular margins, and indeed in this situation its deepest fibers form the posterior capsule of the joint. The bulk of the tendon, however, passes freely across the joint, and broadens out on the dorsal surface of the proximal phalanx. This flat part now divides into three slips; the central slip passes on to the base of the middle phalanx. The two lateral or marginal slips diverge around the central slip. Each receives a strong attachment from the tendons of the interosseous and lumbrical muscles, forming a broad dorsal digital or extensor expansion. The palmar border of the extensor expansion is free and lies virtually in the long axis of the finger. More proximally, the fibers from the interossei and lumbricals radiate across the dorsum of the proximal phalanx to complete the expansion, whose most proximal fibers pass transversely across the base of the phalanx. The fused interosseous tendons and marginal slips of the expansion, passing distally across the middle phalanx, converge to be inserted together into the base of the distal phalanx.

Certain fibrous bands are attached to the extensor apparatus; they are tightened by appropriate positions of the phalanges. The oblique retinacular ligaments are bilateral strong narrow bands attached near the head of the proximal phalanx, straddling the fibrous flexor sheath. Each passes palmar to the proximal interphalangeal joint and joins the marginal slip of the extensor tendon. Extension of the proximal joint draws them tight and limits flexion of the distal joint. Flexion of the proximal joint slackens them and permits full flexion of the distal joint. The two joints thus passively tend to assume similar angulations.

### Long Tendons of the Thumb

On the flexor aspect, there is only one tendon, that of flexor pollicis longus invested by its synovial sheath as it passes to the distal phalanx. On the extensor surface, the tendons of extensor pollicis brevis and longus are each inserted separately (into the proximal and distal phalanx). There is no extensor hood as in the four fingers, but the extensor pollicis longus tendon receives a fibrous expansion from both abductor pollicis brevis and adductor pollicis (Fig. 2.42). These expansions serve to hold the long extensor tendon in place on the dorsum of the thumb.

### Grip

Holding a heavy hammer for banging in a nail or holding a needle for delicate sewing (surgical or otherwise!) are but two illustrations of the variety of grips required for different purposes. For the laborer, the power grip depends on the long flexors of the fingers, with opposition of the thumb assisting the whole hand to give a tight grip. At the same time, synergic contraction of wrist extensors is indispensable for a firm grip of this kind; increasing flexion of the wrist increasingly weakens this grip (Fig. 2.55). In the hook grip, as for carrying a suitcase, the long flexors are in action but wrist extension and opposition may not be necessary accompaniments. The precision grip for dealing with small objects requires wrist stability, but opposition of the thumb to finger pads, especially of the index and middle fingers, are the essential features, and here the small hand muscles are of prime importance (see below).

### Actions of Interossei and Lumbricals

The interossei are inserted into the proximal phalanges and into the extensor expansions. Contracting as palmar or dorsal groups, respectively, they adduct or abduct the fingers away from the midline of the palm. When palmar and dorsal interossei contract together, the adducting and abducting effects cancel out. Flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joints results. The interossei are indispensable for the combined movement of flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joint and simultaneous extension of the interphalangeal joints; but the manner of their action is not perfectly clear. Opposing theories exist. The earliest idea, a very simple one, was that the muscles act as prime movers, and this seems reasonable when one contemplates the anatomy of their insertions. The proximal fibers of the extensor hood run transversely across the first phalanx. Tension of these fibers will bend the phalanx towards the palm. The fibers on the edge of the dorsal expansion run almost along the axis of the finger, and are traceable distally to their insertion into the dorsal aspect of the base of the distal phalanx (Fig. 2.54). Tension on these fibers would naturally be expected to extend the distal phalanx. The difficulty in accepting this rather simple explanation is emphasized by the observation that extensor digitorum is indispensable to the action of extending the terminal phalanx with full force. In radial nerve palsy, or if the digitorum tendon is cut on the dorsum of the hand, the distal phalanx cannot be extended with full force even though the interossei are normal.

The probable explanation of the effect of the interossei on the terminal phalanges is that they are synergists to the prime mover, extensor digitorum. If the interossei are paralyzed (claw hand), the pull of the digitorum tendon is wholly expended on the metacarpophalangeal joint which is hyperextended and there is too much slack in the distal part of the tendon for it to act on the terminal phalanx. If, however, the metacarpophalangeal joint is flexed, the digitorum tendon, passing around its dorsal curve as around a pulley, lengthens the muscle belly, which can now extend the distal phalanx. Clinical evidence from peripheral nerve injuries of radial, median, and ulnar nerves, indicates that the essential action of the interossei is to flex the metacarpophalangeal joints to allow extensor digitorum to extend the interphalangeal joints.

The action of the lumbricals is more obscure. Unlike the interossei, they are attached only to the extensor expansions and not to the proximal phalanges as well. Furthermore, their proximal attachments are not to bone but to tendons, and are therefore mobile. The lumbricals thus provide muscular, and hence proprioceptive, bridges between flexor and extensor muscles - a unique occurrence (as also in the foot) - which may have important implications in adjusting the positions of finger joints. In ulnar palsy, all the interossei are paralyzed but the lumbricals of only the little and ring fingers are out of action. The claw hand of ulnar paralysis affects these fingers most, index and middle fingers being less affected because their lumbrical muscles are intact (median nerve). From this fact and from their anatomical attachment into the extensor expansion, it seems certain that the lumbricals have the same action as the interossei, namely to flex the metacarpophalangeal joints. In closing the fist, the profundus tendon is withdrawn proximally into the palm as the terminal phalanx is flexed. This draws the lumbrical attachment proximally also; it seems absurd to imagine that in this simple movement the lumbrical actually extends the terminal phalanx, opposing the pull of its parent tendon. Here it surely acts simply through the extensor expansion as a flexor of the proximal phalanx.

Much work has been done on the actions of these little muscles, but it seems certain that the last word has by no means yet been said.

**Tests.** The first dorsal interosseous can be tested by abducting the index finger against resistance; the muscle can be seen and palpated between the first two metacarpals. The adducting capacity of the palmar interossei can be tested by trying to hold a piece of card between the adjacent extended fingers while an attempt is made to pull the card away. This test carried out between the index and middle fingers provides a reliable assessment of ulnar nerve integrity.

## Joints of the Hand

An S-shaped midcarpal joint forms a continuous synovial space between the two rows of carpal bones, and this extends proximally and distally between adjacent carpal bones as a continuous intercarpal joint. A similar synovial joint lies between the distal row of carpal bones and the metacarpal bones of the four fingers. This carpometacarpal joint commonly communicates with the midcarpal joint.

The joint between the hamate and fifth metacarpal is the most mobile of the four and the slight flexion possible here aids in cupping the palm. The first carpometacarpal joint (of the thumb) is a separate synovial cavity between the trapezium and first metacarpal bone. The joint surfaces are reciprocally saddle-shaped, to assist in the vitally important movement of opposition. The capsule is reinforced by a lateral ligament which passes from the lateral surface of the trapezium to the radial side of the base of the metacarpal, while converging on to the ulnar side of the metacarpal base are palmar and dorsal ligaments coming from those respective sides of the trapezium.

The metacarpophalangeal joints are synovial joints. They allow of flexion and extension, abduction and adduction. The palmar ligaments are strong pads of fibrocartilage, which limit extension at the joint. Those of the index to little fingers are joined together by transverse bands that together constitute the deep transverse metacarpal ligament, which receives at the sides of the metacarpophalangeal joints bands from the extensor expansion helping to keep the expansion centrally placed. The lumbricals and digital vessels and nerve lie on the palmar side of the deep transverse ligament and the interossei are dorsal to it (Fig. 2.47). These joints (the knuckle joints) lie on the arc of a circle; hence the extended fingers diverge from each other, the flexed fingers crowd together into the palm. A single finger flexed points in towards the tubercle of the scaphoid.

The interphalangeal joints are pure hinge joints, no abduction being possible. Extension is limited by palmar ligaments and by the obliquity of the collateral ligaments; the latter are attached eccentrically, and tighten in extension and in flexion. The joints act like a toggle switch (Fig. 2.56).

## Cutaneous Innervation of the Upper Limb

The segmental supply (dermatomes) of the upper limb has been considered on page 22. Most of the cutaneous nerves are branches of the brachial plexus.

The lateral surface of the arm is supplied by the upper lateral cutaneous and the lower lateral cutaneous nerves, branches of the axillary and radial nerves respectively. Posteriorly over the triceps, a strip of skin is supplied by the posterior cutaneous nerve of the arm, a branch of the radial nerve. The intercostobrachial nerve and the medial cutaneous nerve of the arm supply the medial and anterior surfaces of the arm. It should be noted that the medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm supplies some skin of the arm just above the cubital fossa.

In the forearm, a strip of skin posteriorly is supplied by the posterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm, a branch of the radial nerve. Medial and lateral sides are supplied by the medial and lateral cutaneous nerves of the forearm (from the medial cord of the brachial plexus and musculocutaneous nerves respectively). Each of these divides symmetrically into anterior and posterior branches, which extend down to the wrist, and the anterior branch may just reach the palm.

The palm of the hand is supplied on the ulnar side by the superficial branches of the ulnar nerve. Towards the center of the palm, the skin is innervated by the palmar branch of the median nerve, which perforates the deep fascia proximal to the flexor retinaculum, with a small contribution from the palmar branch of the ulnar nerve over the hypothenar muscles. The palmar surfaces of the fingers and thumb are supplied by digital branches of the ulnar and median nerves. The ulnar digital branches supply the ulnar one and a half fingers on their palmar surfaces, their tips, and their dorsal surfaces over the distal one and a half phalanges. The median nerve by its digital branches supplies the radial three and a half digits on their palmar surfaces, tips, and dorsal surfaces over the distal one and a half phalanges. The dorsal surface of the hand is supplied on the ulnar side (one and a half fingers) by the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve. The radial three and a half digits and the web of the thumb are supplied by the terminal cutaneous branches of the radial nerve.

## Muscular Innervation

In the upper arm, the flexor compartment is supplied by the musculocutaneous nerve, the extensor compartment by the radial. The flexor compartment of the forearm is supplied chiefly by the median nerve, replaced by the ulnar for one and a half muscles (flexor carpi ulnaris and half of flexor digitorum profundus). The extensor compartment of the forearm is supplied by the radial nerve or its motor branch, the posterior interosseous. The intrinsic muscles of the hand are supplied chiefly by the ulnar nerve, the median nerve supplying only the three muscles of the thenar eminence and the radial two lumbricals.

The segmental innervation of the muscles of the upper limb is considered on page 27.

## Sympathetic Innervation

A grey ramus communicans (Fig. 1.21, p. 31) joins each root of the brachial plexus, and these sympathetic fibers hitch-hike through the plexus and its branches and remain in the nerves until very near their area of supply. For example, the grey fibers to an arteriole in a fingertip run in the digital nerves and not along the digital arteries. The grey sympathetic fibers remain invariably with the same segmental fibers which they originally joined.

Thus each dermatome of the upper limb is supplied via the cutaneous nerves by hitch-hiking grey fibers from cell bodies in the appropriate sympathetic ganglion (dermatomes C5 and 6 from cell bodies in the middle cervical ganglion, C7 and 8 from the inferior cervical ganglion and T1 from the first thoracic, or stellate, ganglion). In the skin, the grey rami innervate arterioles, sweat glands, and the arrectores pilorum muscles (for temperature regulation).

The deep sympathetic supply to the limb is by a series of grey fibers that join the main artery from adjacent nerves. These form a periarterial plexus, but it is for only the local branches of the artery; the fibers in the periarterial plexus do not descend along the artery for any considerable distance. Thus, the operation of periarterial sympathectomy denervates only local branches of the artery, and has been long since abandoned for this reason.

The preganglionic fibers for the upper limb come mostly from cell bodies in the upper six thoracic segments of the spinal cord (but see p. 30 for variations). They ascend in the sympathetic trunk to synapse in the ganglia mentioned above.

## Brachial Plexus (Summary)

The branches of the brachial plexus have been studied region by region in the previous pages, but it is convenient also to summarize each nerve as a whole.

The roots of the plexus (the anterior rami of C5-T1 nerves) are between the scalene muscles, the trunks in the posterior triangle, the divisions behind the clavicle, and the cords arranged round the second part of the axillary artery. About 10% of plexuses are prefixed (from C4-C8) and 10% postfixed (C6-T2).

### Branches from the Roots

*   C5 - Dorsal scapular
*   C5, 6 - Nerve to subclavius
*   C5, 6, 7 - Long thoracic

The dorsal scapular nerve (C5; pp. 59 and 67) runs down deep to levator scapulae and the two rhomboids, supplying all three muscles. Lying on serratus posterior superior, it forms a neurovascular bundle with the descending scapular vessels alongside the vertebral border of the scapula (Fig. 2.6).

The nerve to subclavius (C5, 6; p. 67) passes down over the trunks of the plexus and in front of the subclavian vein. If it contains accessory phrenic fibers, these join the phrenic nerve in the superior mediastinum.

The long thoracic nerve (C5, 6, 7; p. 67) descends on the first digitation of the serratus anterior muscle and runs vertically downwards just behind the midaxillary line, i.e., just behind the lateral cutaneous branches of the intercostal nerves and vessels, beneath the deep fascia over the muscle. Its fibers are paid off segmentally. C5 supplies the upper two digitations (which pull on the upper angle of the scapula), C6 the next two (vertebral border of scapula) and C7 the lowest four digitations (pulling on the inferior angle of the scapula, i.e., rotation of the scapula for abduction of the arm).

### Branch from the Trunks

The suprascapular nerve (C5, 6; p. 68), prominent beneath the fascial floor of the posterior triangle, passes beneath the transverse scapular ligament (the suprascapular vessels lie above the ligament). The neurovascular bundle supplies supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and the posterior part of the capsule of the shoulder joint.

### Branches from the Lateral Cord

*   C5, 6, 7 - Lateral pectoral
*   C5, 6, 7 - Musculocutaneous
*   C5, 6, 7 - Lateral root of median

The lateral pectoral nerve (C5, 6, 7; p. 68) passes through the clavipectoral fascia and supplies the upper fibers of pectoralis major. Through the communication with the medial pectoral nerve, it contributes to the supply of pectoralis minor.

The musculocutaneous nerve (C5, 6, 7; pp. 68 and 81) is muscular to the flexors in the arm and cutaneous in the forearm. It supplies coracobrachialis, then pierces that muscle to slope down in the plane between biceps and brachialis, supplying both muscles. Emerging at the lateral border of the biceps tendon, it pierces the deep fascia at the flexure crease of the elbow. It is now called the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm, and supplies skin from the elbow to the wrist by an anterior and a posterior branch along the radial border of the forearm.

The lateral root of the median nerve (C5, 6, 7; pp. 68 and 81) is joined by the medial root at the lateral side of the axillary artery to form the main nerve (see below).

### Branches from the Medial Cord

*   C8, T1 - Medial pectoral
*   C8, T1 - Medial root of median nerve
*   C8, T1 - Medial cutaneous nerve of arm
*   C8, T1 - Medial cutaneous nerve of forearm
*   C7, 8, T1 - Ulnar nerve

The medial pectoral nerve (C8, T1; p. 68) gives a branch to pectoralis minor and then pierces it to supply the lower (sternocostal) fibers of pectoralis major.

The medial root of the median nerve (C8, T1; pp. 68 and 81) crosses the axillary artery to join its companion and form the median nerve (C5-T1; pp. 81 and 94) at the lateral side of the artery.

The median nerve (C5, 6, 7, 8, T1; pp. 68, 81, 94 and 111) supplies most of the flexor muscles of the forearm, but only the three thenar muscles and two lumbricals in the hand. It is cutaneous to the flexor surfaces and nails of the three and a half radial digits and a corresponding area of the palm.

The median nerve leaves the axilla and slopes in front of the brachial artery beneath the deep fascia of the arm. At the elbow, it lies medial to the artery beneath the bicipital aponeurosis. It descends between the two heads of pronator teres and beneath the fibrous arch of flexor digitorum superficialis. Adherent to the deep surface of the muscle, it emerges on the radial side, lying between flexor carpi radialis and palmaris longus tendons before passing through the carpal tunnel into the hand.

**Branches.** In the arm, the nerve gives sympathetic filaments to the brachial artery and a twig to the elbow joint, but no muscular branches unless the nerve to pronator teres has an unusually high origin. In the cubital fossa, it supplies muscular branches to pronator teres, palmaris longus, flexor carpi radialis, and flexor digitorum superficialis, and also gives off the anterior interosseous nerve, which descends on the interosseous membrane to the wrist. The anterior interosseous is the nerve of the deep flexor compartment, for it supplies the radial half (usually) of flexor digitorum profundus, all of flexor pollicis longus and pronator quadratus and is sensory to the interosseous membrane, periosteum of radius and ulna, and the wrist and intercarpal joints. The palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve pierces the deep fascia just above the flexor retinaculum and supplies more than half of the thumb side of the palm.

The median nerve divides in the carpal tunnel and enters the hand as a lateral and a medial branch. The lateral branch gives the important muscular recurrent branch (T1) which recurves around the distal border of the flexor retinaculum to supply the three thenar muscles (abductor and flexor pollicis brevis, and opponens pollicis). Then it breaks up into three palmar digital branches (C6), two for the thumb and one for the index, this last one supplying also the first lumbrical (T1). The medial branch divides into two palmar digital nerves for the adjacent sides of the second and third clefts (C7). The branch for the second cleft supplies also the second lumbrical (T1). The five palmar digital branches supply the nail beds as well as the flexor skin of the radial three and a half digits.

The medial cutaneous nerve of the arm (C8, T1; pp. 68 and 82) is rather a failure. It is sometimes replaced entirely by the intercostobrachial nerve. It runs down with the axillary vein to pierce the deep fascia and supply skin medial to the anterior axial line, but fails to reach the elbow.

The medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm (C8, T1; pp. 68, 82 and 94) is a much bigger nerve than the last. It runs down between the axillary artery and vein and pierces the deep fascia halfway to the elbow (often in common with the basilic vein). It supplies the lower part of the arm above the elbow and then divides into anterior and posterior branches to supply the skin along the ulnar border of the forearm down to the wrist. In the forearm, it is symmetrical with the lateral cutaneous nerve (musculocutaneous) and the two meet without overlap along the anterior axial line. Their territories are separated posteriorly by the posterior cutaneous branch of the radial nerve. The part of the nerve that lies in the upper arm can be used as a graft as this part is a long length without branches.

The ulnar nerve (C7, 8, T1; pp. 68, 82, 94 and 114) is the direct continuation of the medial cord (C8, T1). In 95% of cases, it picks up C7 fibers in the axilla from the lateral cord (these fibers are for flexor carpi ulnaris). The nerve is destined for some flexor muscles on the ulnar side of the forearm and the skin of the ulnar one and a half digits, but it is to be remembered chiefly as the nerve for most of the intrinsic muscles of the hand (i.e., those concerned in fine finger movements).

Running down behind the brachial artery, the ulnar nerve inclines backwards and pierces the medial intermuscular septum. Lying in front of the nerve to the medial head of triceps, it now descends along the triceps to lie on the shaft of the humerus between the medial epicondyle and the olecranon. It passes between the two heads of flexor carpi ulnaris and thus enters the flexor compartment of the forearm. Crossing the sublime tubercle, it descends on flexor digitorum profundus, under cover of flexor carpi ulnaris. Here it is joined by the ulnar artery. The two emerge from beneath the tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris just above the wrist and cross the flexor retinaculum alongside the pisiform bone. On the retinaculum, the nerve divides into its terminal superficial and deep branches.

**Branches.** Several twigs to the elbow joint bind the nerve close against the lower end of the humerus. In the forearm, the nerve supplies flexor carpi ulnaris (C7) and the ulnar half (usually) of flexor digitorum profundus (C8, T1). It has a palmar cutaneous branch (C8) which pierces the deep fascia above the flexor retinaculum to supply skin over the hypothenar muscles. A dorsal cutaneous branch (C8) winds around the lower end of the ulna deep to the tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris, crosses the triquetral bone, and is distributed to the dorsal skin of one and a half fingers and a corresponding area of the back of the hand. On the fingers, it falls short of the nail beds. Not uncommonly, it supplies two and a half instead of one and a half fingers.

The ulnar nerve divides on the flexor retinaculum alongside the pisiform bone. The superficial branch (C8) runs distally beneath palmaris brevis (which it supplies) and is distributed to the ulnar one and a half fingers, including their nail beds, by two digital branches. One of them supplies the ulnar side of the little finger, the other goes to the fourth cleft, and bifurcates to supply the adjacent sides of ring and little fingers.

The deep branch (C8, T1) passes deeply between abductor and flexor digiti minimi then between opponens and the fifth metacarpal. It supplies all three hypothenar muscles. Crossing the palm in the concavity of the deep palmar arch, it supplies the two ulnar lumbricals and all the interossei, both palmar and dorsal. It ends by supplying adductor pollicis.

### Branches from the Posterior Cord

*   C5, 6 - Upper subscapular
*   C6, 7, 8 - Thoracodorsal
*   C5, 6 - Lower subscapular
*   C5, 6 - Axillary
*   C5, 6, 7, 8, T1 - Radial

The upper and lower subscapular nerves (C5, 6; p. 68) supply the respective parts of subscapularis, with the lower nerve also innervating teres minor.

The thoracodorsal nerve (nerve to latissimus dorsi) (C6, 7, 8; p. 68) inclines forwards and enters the deep surface of latissimus dorsi just behind the anterior border; it is vulnerable in operations on the scapular lymph nodes, for its terminal part lies anterior to them and to the subscapular artery.

The axillary nerve (C5, 6; p. 69) supplies deltoid, the shoulder joint, and skin over the joint. It passes backwards through the quadrangular space, lying above the posterior circumflex humeral vessels and in contact with the neck of the humerus just below the capsule of the shoulder joint, which it supplies. Through the quadrangular space, it divides. The posterior branch supplies teres minor and winds around the posterior border of deltoid, supplying a small part of the muscle. As the upper lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm, it supplies skin over the lower half of deltoid, below the supraclavicular nerves. The anterior branch lies on the posterior surface of the humerus between teres minor and the lateral head of triceps and supplies deltoid. A few fine twigs pierce the deltoid to reach a small area of skin over the center of the muscle.

The radial nerve (C5, 6, 7, 8, T1; pp. 69 and 83) is the largest branch of the brachial plexus. It supplies all the muscles of the extensor compartment of the arm and forearm, and is cutaneous to the posterior surface of the arm and forearm and the radial side of the dorsum of the hand.

**Branches.** The posterior cutaneous nerve of the arm (C8 and all of T1 which the radial nerve carries) passes back medial to the long head of triceps and pierces the deep fascia to supply a strip of skin along the extensor surface of the arm down to the elbow. Although a three-headed muscle, triceps is supplied by four radial nerve branches. They arise as nerves to the long, medial, lateral, and medial heads, usually in that order as the main nerve begins to wind round behind the humerus. The first branch to the medial head (the ulnar collateral nerve) runs down behind the ulnar nerve to enter the lower part of the medial head. The second branch to the medial head continues deep to triceps to supply anconeus.

The lower lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm (C5) is given off just before the radial nerve pierces the lateral intermuscular septum. It passes up to the skin between the septum and the lateral head of triceps to supply skin over the lateral surface of the arm down to the elbow. In common with it arises the posterior cutaneous nerve of the forearm (C6, 7), which runs straight down behind the elbow to supply a strip of skin over the extensor surface of the forearm as far as the wrist. (In the working position of pronation, this skin faces towards the front of the body.)

While lying in the flexor compartment of the forearm between brachialis and brachioradialis, the main trunk gives a small branch to the lateral part of brachialis (not the main supply to this muscle) and supplies brachioradialis (C5, 6) and extensor carpi radialis longus (C6, 7). At the bend of the elbow, it gives off the posterior interosseous branch, and then continues on as the terminal cutaneous branch already described.

The posterior interosseous nerve (C5, 6, 7, 8) supplies extensor carpi radialis brevis and supinator in the cubital fossa, and then spirals down around the upper end of the radius between the two layers of supinator to enter the extensor compartment of the forearm. It crosses abductor pollicis longus, dips down to the interosseous membrane and runs to the back of the wrist. In the extensor compartment, it supplies seven more muscles; three extensors from the common extensor origin (extensor digitorum, extensor digiti minimi, and extensor carpi ulnaris), the three thumb muscles (abductor pollicis longus, extensor pollicis brevis, and extensor pollicis longus) and extensor indicis. It is sensory to the interosseous membrane, periosteum of radius and ulna, and the wrist and carpal joints on their extensor surfaces.

## Nerve Injuries

In order to obtain a quick appraisal of the integrity of a major limb nerve, it is not necessary to test every muscle supplied. Usually a key muscle and action can be selected that will indicate whether or not the nerve is intact. The following summary includes notes on selected nerve injuries and methods for exposing nerves if exploration or repair is required. (For a similar summary of lower limb nerve injuries, see p. 214.)

### Brachial Plexus Injuries

Damage to the whole plexus is rare but devastating. The commonest cause is a motorbike accident, landing on the shoulder with the neck being forced in the opposite direction, so avulsing the nerve roots. If all the roots are damaged, the whole limb is immobile and anesthetic, and Horner's syndrome (p. 519) may be present. If serratus anterior and the rhomboids are still in action, the damage is distal to the root origins of the dorsal scapular and long thoracic nerves; if supraspinatus and infraspinatus escape, the damage is distal to the upper trunk.

The commonest traction injury to the plexus is to the upper roots and trunk (C5 and 6 - Erb's paralysis) and includes birth injury (Erb-Duchenne paralysis). The abductors and lateral rotators of the shoulder and the supinators are paralyzed so that the arm hangs by the side, medially rotated, extended at the elbow and pronated, with loss of sensation on the lateral side of the arm and forearm.

Damage to the lowest roots (C8 and T1) is unusual (cervical rib) but includes Klumpke's paralysis due to birth injury during a breech delivery where the arm remains above the head. The small muscles of the hand are those most obviously affected, leading to claw hand with inability to extend the fingers, with sensory loss on the ulnar side of the forearm and possibly a Horner's syndrome.

Pectoralis major, being the only muscle supplied by all five segments of the plexus, may be a useful guide to the extent of a plexus injury.

**Surgical approach.** The supraclavicular part of the plexus can be exposed in the angle between sternocleidomastoid and the clavicle. The inferior belly of omohyoid and the superficial cervical vessels are removed and the roots of the plexus are identified behind scalenus anterior, which may be cut (carefully avoiding damage to the phrenic nerve) to display the lower trunk. To expose the infraclavicular part, the deltopectoral groove is opened up and pectoralis minor detached from the coracoid process so that the plexus branches around the axillary artery can be dissected out from the axillary sheath. The middle part of the clavicle may have to be removed if a more proximal exposure is needed.

### Axillary Nerve Injury

The nerve may be damaged in 5% of dislocations of the shoulder, in fractures of the upper end of the humerus or by misplaced injections into deltoid. This muscle is paralyzed and there may be an egg-shaped area of anesthesia over the outer side of the upper arm below the acromion. Where possible, test for abduction of the shoulder by deltoid (p. 74), otherwise the area of anesthesia gives the clue to the nerve damage.

### Musculocutaneous Nerve Injury

This nerve is rarely injured. Test for flexion of the elbow by biceps (p. 79). Beware of brachioradialis (radial nerve) simulating the flexor action of biceps and brachialis; biceps must be felt.

**Surgical approach.** Exposure of the nerve involves opening up the deltopectoral groove and identifying the nerve as it enters coracobrachialis from the lateral cord of the plexus, below the lower border of teres minor.

### Radial Nerve Injury

The nerve is most commonly injured high up, by fractures of the shaft of the humerus. Transient paralysis may be due to improper use of a crutch pressing on the nerve in the axilla, or Saturday night palsy from draping the arm over a chair when in a state of diminished consciousness. The characteristic lesion is wrist drop with inability to extend the wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints (but the interphalangeal joints can still be straightened by the action of the interossei and lumbricals). Sensory loss is minimal and usually confined to a coin-shaped area overlying the first dorsal interosseous, a much smaller area than the distribution of the nerve as seen in dissections; there is apparently much overlap from the median and ulnar nerves. For high injury, test for extension of the elbow by triceps (p. 83), remembering that the branches to triceps arise before the nerve reaches the humerus. For injury at a lower level (e.g., posterior interosseous branch), test for extension of the wrist.

**Surgical approach.** The radial nerve in the arm may be exposed from the back by detaching the lateral head of triceps from the humerus to reveal the nerve as it crosses the upper part of the medial head before coming to lie in the radial groove. At the elbow, brachioradialis and extensor carpi radialis longus are detached from the humerus and turned forwards to show the nerve dividing into its superficial and deep (posterior interosseous) branches. The superficial part of supinator can be incised if the deep branch has to be followed downwards.

### Ulnar Nerve Injury

This is most commonly injured behind the elbow or at the wrist. The classical sign of a low lesion is claw hand, with hyperextension of the metacarpophalangeal joints of the ring and little fingers and flexion of the interphalangeal joints because their interossei and lumbricals are paralyzed and so cannot flex the metacarpophalangeal joints or extend the interphalangeal joints. The claw is produced by the unopposed action of the extensors and of flexor digitorum profundus. Injury at the elbow or above gives straighter fingers because the ulnar half of flexor digitorum profundus is now out of action and cannot flex the distal interphalangeal joints of the ring and little fingers. Wasting of interossei eventually becomes obvious on the dorsum of the hand, giving the appearance of guttering between the metacarpals. There is variable sensory loss on the ulnar side of the hand and on the little and ring fingers but often less than might be expected.

As representative of the small muscles of the hand supplied by this nerve, test for abduction of the index finger by the first dorsal interosseous (p. 120). For a high lesion, test for the action of the ulnar half of flexor digitorum profundus in flexing the distal interphalangeal joint of the little finger (p. 91).

**Surgical approach.** Exposure of the ulnar nerve in the upper arm is along the medial border of biceps, where the nerve is adjacent to the brachial artery. At the elbow, it is easily approached behind the medial epicondyle, and in the forearm, it can be followed upwards from the pisiform, where it lies between the bone and ulnar artery, by displacing flexor carpi ulnaris medially.

### Median Nerve Injury

This is most commonly injured at the wrist - by cuts, or compression in the carpal tunnel. There is eventually wasting of the thenar eminence, but because of the variable nerve supply of flexor pollicis brevis, the only obvious wasting may be over abductor pollicis brevis.

Theoretically, there is sensory loss over the radial three fingers and radial side of the palm, but the only autonomous areas of median nerve supply are over the pulp pads of the index and middle fingers, and the actual sensory loss may be difficult to define. The most important areas of loss are over the pads of the thumb and index finger. With high lesions, there is wasting of the front of the forearm because the long flexors (except flexor carpi ulnaris and half of flexor digitorum profundus) and the pronators are paralyzed. The hand is held with the index finger straight, in the pointing finger position, often with all other fingers flexed, including the middle finger. Although the part of flexor digitorum profundus to the middle finger tendon is expected to have a median supply (like the whole of superficialis), its close connection with the part supplied by the ulnar nerve can lead to middle finger flexion. Furthermore, this part of the muscle may be supplied by the ulnar nerve and not the median. For high lesions, test flexor pollicis longus and finger flexors by pinching together the pads of the thumb and index finger. For lesions at wrist level, test abductor pollicis brevis (p. 110); do not choose flexor pollicis brevis because of its uncertain nerve supply.

**Surgical approach.** In the arm, the median nerve is easily exposed by incision along the medial border of biceps, where the nerve is adjacent to the brachial artery, and in the cubital fossa, it lies medial to the biceps tendon. In the forearm, it is displayed by detaching the radial head of flexor digitorum superficialis from the radius and turning the muscle medially to show the nerve adhering to its deep surface. Relief of compression in the carpal tunnel involves incising the flexor retinaculum longitudinally on the ulnar side of the nerve, to avoid damage to the muscular (recurrent) branch which usually arises immediately distal to the retinaculum and curves radially into the thenar muscles.

## Bones of the Upper Limb

### Clavicle

The clavicle (collar bone) is longer (14 cm plus) in the broad-shouldered male, and its curvatures are usually more pronounced than in the female. The medial two-thirds or more is rounded, rather quadrilateral in section and convex forwards to clear the neurovascular bundle of the upper limb, at the apex of the axilla (Fig. 2.12). The lateral one-third or less is flat, and curves back to meet the scapula. The upper surface is smoother than the lower, especially in the lateral flat part. The bone lies horizontally and is subcutaneous; it is crossed by the supraclavicular nerves and very occasionally by a communication between the external jugular and cephalic veins. The main parts are the shaft, the bulbous sternal end, and the flattened acromial end.

The sternal end (Fig. 2.8) is occupied by a facet for the disc of the sternoclavicular joint. The disc is attached along the upper and posterior margin of the articular surface in a curved groove. The articular area below this extends to the under surface, for articulation with the first costal cartilage (Fig. 2.58). The articular surface is covered in life by fibrocartilage identical with that of the disc. The capsule and synovial membrane are attached around the margin of the articular surface.

The shaft is smooth on its upper surface, except for the attachment of sternocleidomastoid and trapezius. The lower surface shows a prominent oval plateau (or a pit) for the costoclavicular ligament, and a groove for the subclavius muscle. The conoid tubercle and trapezoid ridge provide attachment for the coracoclavicular ligament.

The subclavian muscle is attached to the subclavian groove, which is limited by two ridges that give attachment to the clavipectoral fascia. The subclavian vessels lie nearby, and further laterally, the newly formed lateral cord of the brachial plexus lies behind bare bone (Fig. 2.12). Here the nutrient artery, a branch of the suprascapular, runs laterally into the bone. The posterior border of the flat lateral one-third gives attachment to the occipital fibers of trapezius; this muscle encroaches somewhat on the upper surface, leaving a polished mark. The lateral extremity shows a small overhanging oval facet for the acromioclavicular joint (p. 62).

Anteriorly, the flat lateral one-third gives origin to deltoid, which muscle encroaches like trapezius somewhat on the upper surface, leaving a concave polished area limited by a low ridge. A deltoid tubercle sometimes projects into the muscle near the medial limit of this origin. The anterior surface of the medial half of the clavicle is flattened slightly by the origin of pectoralis major, faint ridges marking the limits of attachment of the muscle. The cephalic vein lies below the gap between the deltoid and pectoral attachments.

The upper surface receives the interclavicular ligament alongside the capsule attachment. The clavicular head of sternocleidomastoid arises from a wide area on the medial one-third or more of this surface (Fig. 6.57, p. 523), but usually leaves no very apparent mark on the bone. Two layers of cervical fascia (p. 421) surround sternocleidomastoid and trapezius and are attached separately to the bone between these muscles, at the base of the posterior triangle (Fig. 2.3).

The lower surface shows some very characteristic features (Fig. 2.58). Lateral to the articular surface, which usually encroaches from the sternal end, there is an oval plateau (or a pit) for attachment of the costoclavicular ligament. From here, a groove for the subclavius muscle extends as far as the conoid tubercle. A nutrient foramen commonly extends laterally in this groove. The lips of the groove give attachment to the clavipectoral fascia (Fig. 2.3). The posterior lip extends to a prominent rounded boss, the conoid tubercle, near the posterior border of the flat part; it lies buried in the base of the conoid ligament (Fig. 2.9). The conoid tubercle lies close to the knuckle of the coracoid process. A synovial joint sometimes exists between the two bones, within the conoid ligament. From the conoid tubercle, the rough irregular trapezoid ridge extends obliquely across the bone to end near the articular facet, and provides attachment for the strong trapezoid ligament (p. 62).

The acromial end is flat, with a facet on its lateral edge which faces laterally and slightly downwards for articulation with the acromion. The capsule and synovial membrane are attached to the margin of the articular surface, which like that at the sternal end is covered by fibrocartilage.

Fracture of the clavicle is common; the break is always between the costoclavicular and coracoclavicular ligaments, each of which is stronger than the clavicle itself.

**Ossification.** The bone appears in membrane before there is yet any cartilage in the embryo. It is the first bone of the skeleton. Two centers, which ossify at the fifth week, rapidly fuse; elongation, which occurs at the sternal end, is in secondary cartilage (p. 10). An epiphysis at the sternal end appears radiologically during the late teens and fuses during the twenties.

### Scapula

The scapula (shoulder blade) is triangular. The lateral angle is thick to accommodate the glenoid cavity, and projected upwards into the rugged coracoid process (Fig. 2.9). The lateral border is thick down to the inferior angle. The rest of the blade is composed of thin, translucent bone. From the upper part of the dorsal surface, a triangular spine projects back and extends laterally as a curved plate of bone, the acromion, over the shoulder joint (Fig. 2.19).

The costal surface is concave, and marked by three or four ridges that converge from the medial border towards the lateral angle. These give attachment to fibrous septa from which the multipennate fibers of subscapularis arise. This muscle is attached to the concavity of the costal surface and to the lateral border of the scapula back to a sinuous ridge that runs down from the infraglenoid tubercle (see below). The thick bone of the lateral angle is bare, separated from the overlying muscle by the subscapularis bursa; the ridges have faded out here. Vascular foramina perforate the bone over the bare area. The medial margin of the costal surface receives the insertion of serratus anterior (Figs 2.10 and 2.11). The first two digitations are attached to a smooth, flat, elongated triangle from the superior angle down to the base of the spine. The next two digitations are thinned out from this level down to the inferior angle, while the last four digitations converge to a roughened area on the costal surface of the inferior angle. A ridge separates the attachment of serratus anterior from the concavity of the subscapularis origin, and this ridge gives attachment to the strong fascia on the surface of subscapularis.

The upper border of the blade slants down to the root of the coracoid process, where it dips into the little scapular notch, which lodges the suprascapular nerve. The notch is bridged by the transverse scapular ligament, and the inferior belly of omohyoid arises from this ligament and the nearby upper border of the blade. The fascia over subscapularis is attached along the upper border of the bone. The medial (vertebral) border, from superior to inferior angle, gives edge to edge attachment to levator scapulae, rhomboid minor, and rhomboid major (p. 58).

The lateral (axillary) border extends from the glenoid cavity to the inferior angle. Just below the glenoid fossa, it shows a rough triangular plateau, the infraglenoid tubercle (this may be depressed into a fossa), and this gives origin to the long head of triceps. From this area, a sharp ridge runs down and turns over the dorsal surface of the inferior angle above the origin of teres major. Subscapularis arises from the groove on the costal surface of this ridge and its fascia is attached to the ridge (p. 63).

The dorsal surface of the blade is divided by the backwardly projecting spine into a small supraspinous and a large infraspinous fossa. The supraspinous fossa lodges supraspinatus, which muscle is covered in a strong fascia attached to the upper margin of the spine and the upper border of the blade. The muscle arises from the whole area of the spine and adjoining blade, but not from the lateral angle. The large infraspinous fossa is concave on the under surface of the spine, and there is a groove alongside the lateral border, but between these two hollows, the thin blade is convex in conformity with the concavity of the costal surface. Infraspinatus arises from the whole of this fossa (but not from the lateral angle). Teres major arises from a large oval area at the inferior angle, and teres minor from an elongated narrower area dorsal to the ridge on the lateral border (Fig. 2.16). This origin of teres minor is commonly bisected by a groove made by the circumflex scapular vessels. Infraspinatus and teres minor are covered by a thick fascia that is attached to bone at the margins of these two muscles. Along the ridge on the lateral border, this attachment is shared with the fascia over subscapularis.

The spine is thick as it projects back from a horizontal attachment on the dorsal surface of the blade. It is twisted a little, so its posterior border slopes upwards towards the acromion. Its free lateral border curves widely out as a buttress to the inferior surface of the acromion, arching behind the upper part of the lateral angle. The suprascapular vessels and nerve run here to reach the infraspinous fossa. The acromion itself is rectangular, and carries the facet for the clavicle at the anterior end of its medial border (Fig. 2.59). The dorsal surface of the spine and acromion are subcutaneous and palpable. Along the medial border of the acromion and the upper margin of the spine is a bevelled surface, 5 mm wide, for the insertion of trapezius (Fig. 2.16). Some 3 cm short of the medial border of the scapula, this curves down and laterally to form a lip on the inferior margin of the spine. This lip is sometimes called the deltoid tubercle; it receives the lowermost fibers of trapezius, which converge here. The medial end of the spine, alongside the border of the blade, is triangular and smooth. The tendon of trapezius plays over it, lubricated by a bursa. The deltoid tubercle, though made by the trapezius attachment, marks the beginning of the attachment of deltoid, for from this place the muscle arises along the inferior margin of the spine and, in continuity, from the posterior, lateral, and anterior borders of the acromion up to the clavicular facet. Along its lateral border, the acromion shows four or more vertical ridges (Fig. 2.59) for attachment of septa in the multipennate central mass of the deltoid muscle. The junction of lateral and anterior borders of the acromion, 2 cm lateral to the acromioclavicular joint, forms the prominent bony tip of the shoulder (but not the most lateral part of the shoulder region, which is deltoid overlying the greater tuberosity of the humerus), and from here the length of the upper limb may be measured. In front of the facet for the clavicle, the fibers of the coracoacromial ligament converge (Fig. 2.18). Beneath this ligament and the bare bone of the acromion, the subacromial (subdeltoid) bursa lubricates the tendon of supraspinatus and the rotator cuff. Above the coracoacromial ligament, the deltoid origin continues across the acromion (Fig. 2.59) to the lateral part of the clavicle.

The lateral angle of the scapula is wedge-shaped, broadening from the narrow neck out to the prominent margins of the glenoid cavity. The upper part of this wedge-shaped bone is projected upwards as the base of the coracoid process (Fig. 2.17). Two morphological elements are fused here (p. 53), and their epiphyseal junction crosses the upper part of the pear-shaped glenoid cavity (Fig. 2.9). The cavity does not face directly lateral, but peeps forwards a little around the convexity of the chest wall. The prominent lips of the cavity are raised higher by the attachment of the glenoid labrum. At the upper limit (the stem of the pear), just on the base of the coracoid, lies the supraglenoid tubercle, for attachment of the long head of biceps within the shoulder joint capsule. The capsule is attached to the labrum and to the surrounding bone. The infraglenoid tubercle lies on the lateral angle, outside the capsule. There are no other attachments to the lateral angle, whose bare bone is perforated by nutrient vessels, and separated from the tendons of subscapularis, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus by a bursa beneath each.

The coracoid process rises from its broad base and curves forward like a bent finger. Its tip is palpable by pressing backwards and laterally just below the clavicle, under cover of the anterior margin of deltoid. The process is for muscle and ligament attachments, the ligaments being indispensable to the stability of the pectoral girdle. The conoid ligament is attached by its apex to the knuckle of the coracoid process (Fig. 2.59). From here, a smooth narrow line runs towards the tip for attachment of the trapezoid ligament. Lateral to this, the margin of the process gives attachment to the base of the coracoacromial ligament, which is a functional socket for the head of the humerus. The weaker coracohumeral ligament sweeps from the under surface of the coracoid process to the anatomical neck of the humerus. The pectoralis minor is attached along the medial border of the coracoid process for about 2 cm behind its tip. The tip itself is bevelled to an arrow shape. From the lateral facet arises the tendon of the short head of biceps and, conjoined with it, from the medial facet comes the origin of coracobrachialis.

**Ossification.** Mesenchyme chondrifies at the sixth week, when the whole scapula becomes cartilaginous. A bony center appears in the eighth week at the thick part of the lateral angle and gradually enlarges. At birth, the blade and spine are ossified, but the acromion, coracoid process, medial border, and inferior angle are still composed of hyaline cartilage. Secondary centers appear in these places, and around the lower margin of the glenoid cavity, at about puberty, and all are fused by 25 years. The center at the base of the coracoid process ossifies at 10 years and fuses, across the glenoid cavity, soon after puberty.

### Humerus

The shaft of the humerus, the bone of the arm, expands above into an upper end whose articular surface looks up and back (Fig. 2.61). The lower part of the shaft curves gently forwards to a flat lower end projected into medial and lateral epicondyles, between which lies the articular surface of the elbow joint (Fig. 2.25). The medial epicondyle projects in the same direction as the articular surface of the head and is much more prominent than the lateral epicondyle. The humerus at rest lies with its articular head facing backwards as well as medially. The bone on a table lies in some degree of lateral rotation.

The upper end, expanded above the shaft, consists of the convex articular surface and, anterior to this, the tuberosities. The articular surface is the head, and the articular margin is the anatomical neck. It is the thickest, not the narrowest, part of the upper end. The common sense neck, a common site for fracture, somewhat below the epiphyseal line, is at the upper end of the shaft and is referred to as the surgical neck; the axillary nerve winds round behind it.

The head (articular surface) forms about one-third of a sphere and is about four times the area of the glenoid cavity of the scapula. It is coated with hyaline cartilage. At rest, its lower and anterior quadrant articulates with the glenoid cavity, giving a good range of lateral rotation and abduction from this position (confirm this point on the dry bones). In Figure 2.19, the humerus was deliberately drawn in slight lateral rotation, to expose more articular surface to view.

The capsule of the shoulder joint, bridging the bicipital groove at its attachment to the transverse ligament, is attached to the articular margin except medially, where it extends down along the shaft for 2 cm, here enclosing the epiphyseal line. The synovial membrane lines the capsule and is attached to the articular margin. The long tendon of biceps is enclosed in a sheath of synovial membrane, one end of which is attached to the transverse ligament and underlying articular margin (the other end of the sheath is attached around the supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula).

The lesser tuberosity (properly called the lesser tubercle) projects prominently forwards, and is continued downwards as the medial lip of the bicipital groove. An undulating area of smooth bone indicates the insertion of the tendon of subscapularis, while edge to edge below this, teres major is received into the medial lip for a distance of nearly 5 cm (Fig. 2.10). The intertubercular groove (formerly the bicipital groove) lies on the anterior surface of the upper end (Fig. 2.60). It is bridged above by the transverse humeral ligament beneath which the long tendon of biceps leaves the joint (Fig. 2.18). The floor of the groove receives the ribbon-like tendon of latissimus dorsi.

The greater tuberosity (greater tubercle) is bare bone, perforated by vessels, except at its projecting junction with the head. Here three smooth facets receive the tendons of scapular muscles. Superiorly is the facet for supraspinatus (Fig. 2.60). Behind this lies a smooth facet for infraspinatus, while posteriorly the lowest facet receives teres minor (Fig. 2.61), whose tendon is inserted also into the shaft below the facet. Below this tendon, the bare bone lies in contact with the axillary nerve and its vessels. The lateral lip of the bicipital groove extends down from the anterior margin of the greater tuberosity to run into the anterior margin of the deltoid tuberosity. It receives the folded tendon of pectoralis major, whose posterior lamina is attached as high up as the joint capsule (i.e., the anatomical neck). The anterior lamina extends only as high as the surgical neck.

Much of the shaft is triangular in section. Viewed from in front, the lateral lip of the bicipital groove runs into the anterior margin of the deltoid tuberosity and is continued down in the midline of the bone. Lateral to this, the bare bone of the greater tuberosity continues down to the deltoid tuberosity, nearly halfway down the shaft. The tuberosity is a V-shaped prominent ridge, with a smaller ridge between, the three giving attachment to fibrous septa in the multipennate acromial fibers of the deltoid. Below the deltoid tuberosity, the lower end of the radial groove spirals down. The posterior margin of the groove runs down as the lateral supracondylar ridge and curves forwards into the lateral epicondyle (Fig. 2.28). The ridge gives attachment to the lateral intermuscular septum. The medial lip of the bicipital groove continues down into the medial supracondylar ridge, which at its lower end curves into the prominent medial epicondyle. The ridge gives attachment to the medial intermuscular septum. Level with the lower part of the deltoid tuberosity, the nutrient foramen, directed down towards the elbow, lies just in front of this medial border of the humerus. Above this foramen, opposite the deltoid tuberosity, coracobrachialis is inserted and sometimes leaves a linear roughness. The flexor surface of the humerus, between the supracondylar ridges, gives origin to brachialis and this extends upwards to embrace the deltoid tuberosity both in the lower part of the spiral groove and between the tuberosity and the insertion of coracobrachialis. The occasional supratrochlear spur on this surface is mentioned on page 79.

Viewed from behind, the shaft appears twisted, but this is due only to the radial groove behind and below the deltoid tuberosity. The lateral lip of this groove extends upwards from the posterior margin of the deltoid tuberosity; the lateral head of triceps arises here, extending up almost to the axillary nerve below the teres minor insertion. The lateral supracondylar ridge, as already noted, spirals up behind the radial groove to fade out on the posterior surface of the shaft level with the upper limit of the deltoid tuberosity. The medial head (i.e., the deep head) of triceps arises high up here and from the whole shaft between the supracondylar ridges down almost to the olecranon fossa. This head arises too from the medial and lateral intermuscular septa (p. 82). Between the origins of medial and lateral heads, the radial groove lies bare; only in its lowest part does the radial nerve lie in contact with the bone (p. 83). The profunda brachii vessels run with it.

The lower end of the humerus (Fig. 2.62) carries the articular surface for the elbow joint and is projected into medial and lateral epicondyles for attachment of muscles for the flexor and extensor compartments of the forearm (Fig. 2.25). Anterior and posterior appearances are quite different. The articular surface, coated with hyaline cartilage, shows the conjoined capitulum and trochlea. The capitulum, for articulation with the head of the radius, is a section of a sphere. It projects forwards and inferiorly from the lateral part and is bounded by a prominent ridge from the nonarticular bone. The trochlea, unlike the capitulum, extends also to the posterior surface. Its medial margin is a high ridge curving prominently from front to back around the lower end of the humerus, and this carries the side-to-side concavity of the trochlea with it into rather more than a semicircle. Laterally, a lower ridge runs on into the capitulum in front and below. Behind this, beyond the capitulum, the ridge bounds the trochlea and arches over the olecranon fossa towards the medial epicondyle on the back of the bone. The difference in prominence between the two ridges gives a tilt to the trochlea which accounts for the carrying angle at the elbow.

On the anterior surface, the shaft shows a shallow coronoid fossa separated by translucent bone from the depths of the olecranon fossa; this is above the concave part of the trochlea. The anterior border of the humerus runs down to the lateral ridge on the trochlea (Fig. 2.25) and here, above the capitulum, a shallow radial fossa accommodates the head of the radius in full flexion. The capsule of the elbow joint is attached to the ridges that form the margins of the capitulum and trochlea and to the shaft of the humerus above the coronoid and radial fossae in front and the olecranon fossa behind. The synovial membrane, as in all synovial joints, is attached to the articular margins. It thus clothes the floors of these fossae before being reflected to the deep surface of the capsule.

The medial epicondyle, more prominent than the lateral (Fig. 2.25), points in the same direction as the head of the humerus. It shows an undulating smooth facet on its anterior surface for the common flexor origin of forearm muscles. Pronator teres arises from the medial supracondylar ridge just above this. Posteriorly, between the smooth epicondyle and the curving ridge of the trochlea, is a groove which lodges the ulnar nerve (Fig. 2.62), here in contact with the shaft of the humerus (see Ossification, below). Deeply on the distal border of this epicondyle is a small facet for attachment of the ulnar collateral (medial) ligament of the elbow joint.

The lateral epicondyle shows an undulating smooth facet on its anterior surface for the common extensor origin of forearm muscles, i.e., extensor carpi radialis brevis, extensor digitorum, extensor digiti minimi, and extensor carpi ulnaris (p. 99). Above this, the lateral supracondylar ridge gives attachment to the lateral intermuscular septum. Here brachioradialis arises from the upper two-thirds and extensor carpi radialis longus from the lower one-third of the ridge. At the distal border of the epicondyle, the radial collateral (lateral) ligament of the elbow is attached, and around this the superficial fibers of supinator arise. Behind supinator is a shallow pit for anconeus, whose fibers arise also above this, in continuity with the lowest fibers of the medial (deep) head of triceps.

**Surgical approach.** The shaft can be exposed from the front by opening up the deltopectoral groove, and lower down by splitting brachialis vertically. The splitting incision is made anterolaterally and obliquely towards the middle of the front of the shaft, to keep well away from the brachial artery and median nerve. The radial nerve must be remembered when stripping periosteum from the lateral side of the lower part of the shaft. Exposure of the shaft from behind involves opening up the interval between the long and lateral heads of triceps and splitting the medial head vertically in the midline, avoiding the profunda vessels and the radial nerve with its branches to triceps.

**Ossification.** The whole is cartilaginous at the sixth week. A primary center appears in the center of the shaft at the eighth week. Upper and lower ends are cartilaginous at birth. Secondary centers appear at both ends. For the upper end, they are in the head during the first year, greater tuberosity at the third and lesser tuberosity at the fifth year. These three fuse by the seventh year into a single bony epiphysis, hollowed to fit a conical projection of the bony shaft. The epiphyseal line skirts the bone across the lowest margin of the articular surface, cutting across the tuberosities. This is the growing end of the bone; fusion occurs at about 20 years. At the lower end, four centers appear. There is one for the capitulum and lateral ridge of the trochlea at the second year, one for the medial epicondyle at the fifth year, the remainder of the trochlea at the twelfth and the lateral epicondyle at the thirteenth year. The medial epicondyle remains a separate center, separated by a downward projection of the shaft (in contact with the ulnar nerve) from the other three, which fuse together. Union with the shaft occurs at about 18 years.

### Radius

This bone carries the hand, and is stabilized against the ulna for pronation-supination and against the humerus for flexion-extension of the forearm. From a cylindrical head, the bone tapers into a narrow neck. The shaft becomes increasingly thick as it curves down to the massive lower extremity (Figs 2.63 and 2.64).

The head is cylindrical and is covered with hyaline cartilage. It is palpable in the depression behind the lateral side of the extended elbow, where it can be felt rotating in pronation-supination movements. A spherical hollow forms the upper surface, to fit the capitulum. The cylindrical circumference is continuous with this hollow, and is deepest on the medial side of the curvature; it articulates with the radial notch of the ulna and with the annular ligament. The synovial membrane of the elbow joint is attached to the articular margin, but head and neck are free of any capsule attachment, to rotate in the clasp of the annular ligament, which normally holds it in place; a sudden jerk on the hand of a child may avulse the head from the ligament, like pulling a cork out of a bottle. The narrow neck is enclosed by the tapered lower margin of the annular ligament, below which the loose fibers of the quadrate ligament are attached.

The shaft is characterized at its upper end by an oval prominence, the radial tuberosity, projecting towards the ulna. The biceps tendon is attached along the posterior lip, and a bursa lies against the anterior surface of the tuberosity. In full pronation, the tuberosity rotates back and looks laterally (Fig. 2.35), winding the biceps tendon around the radius. From the anterior margin of the tuberosity, the anterior oblique line forms a ridge that runs down to the point of greatest convexity of the shaft. It is mirrored by a similar, but less prominent, posterior oblique line on the extensor surface of the shaft. Between the two oblique lines, the interosseous border is sharp. The oblique cord is attached at the upper end and passes up to the ulna; the fibers of the interosseous membrane pass down to the ulna. On the flexor surface, the flexor digitorum superficialis is attached to the anterior oblique line, and flexor pollicis longus arises from a length of bone below this (and from the interosseous membrane) down to pronator quadratus. The lower part of the flexor surface is hollowed out above the expanded lower extremity; here pronator quadratus is inserted into the lower one-fifth of the shaft. On the extensor surface below the posterior oblique line is the oblique origin of abductor pollicis longus (this origin extends across the interosseous membrane up to the ulna). Below this, extensor pollicis brevis arises obliquely from a slightly hollowed-out area and from the membrane. The lower part of the shaft is bare on the extensor surface (Fig. 2.41).

The lower end of the bone is expanded and is best studied surface by surface. The ulnar surface shows a notch for articulation with the head of the ulna. Above this is a triangular area enclosed by anterior and posterior ridges into which the interosseous border divides. The interosseous membrane is attached to the posterior ridge. In front of it lies the sacciform recess (p. 95) and then the deepest fibers of pronator quadratus are attached to the front of the triangle. Inferiorly is the articular surface for the wrist joint, two concave areas covered with hyaline cartilage. The ulnar (medial) surface is square, and articulates with the lunate. It continues into the hyaline cartilage of the ulnar notch, but in the intact wrist, the triangular fibrocartilage is attached to the right-angled border between the two and divides the distal radioulnar and wrist joints from each other. The lateral concave area is triangular, with its apex on the styloid process. It articulates with the scaphoid. The capsule and synovial membrane are attached to the articular margins and to the fibrocartilage. The anterior (flexor) surface of the lower extremity shows a prominent ridge below the pronator quadratus hollow. Between this ridge and the articular margin is a smooth area to which is attached the very strong anterior ligament of the wrist joint. The fibers of this ligament pass transversely to the medial side of the carpus.

Laterally, the lower end is projected into the pyramidal styloid process, to the tip of which the radial collateral ligament of the wrist joint is attached and into whose base the tendon of brachioradialis is inserted. Between this and the ridge of the pronator hollow, the tendons of abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis lie, in their synovial sheaths, in a single compartment beneath the extensor retinaculum. On the posterior surface beyond the styloid process, a broad groove leads to the prominent dorsal tubercle (of Lister). It lodges, each in a separate sheath, the flat tendons of extensors carpi radialis longus and brevis, sharing a single compartment beneath the extensor retinaculum. On the ulnar side of the dorsal tubercle is a narrow groove that lodges the tendon of extensor pollicis longus in its synovial sheath, in a separate compartment. Between this and the ulnar notch is another broad groove. In the one compartment lie the four tendons of extensor digitorum with the tendon of extensor indicis beneath them on the bare bone. All five tendons share a common synovial sheath. The tendon of extensor digiti minimi, in its sheath, crosses the radioulnar joint in a separate compartment.

The extensor retinaculum, a thickening of deep fascia, is attached to the prominent ridge on the lateral side of the pronator hollow (i.e., on the anterior surface of the radius, Fig. 2.33) and sweeps obliquely across to the ulnar side of the carpus. Septa pass from it to the radius, making compartments for the extensor tendons as noted above. Four compartments lie on the lower end of the radius, and a fifth over the radioulnar joint. The sixth and last compartment lies over the head of the ulna.

This expanded lower end takes the full thrust (via the thenar eminence) of a fall on the outstretched hand, and may lead to Colles' fracture of the lower end. The fibrocartilaginous disc is not torn but forms a fulcrum about which the characteristic deformities of the distal fragment occur: lateral rotation and displacement, dorsal rotation and displacement, supination and impaction.

**Surgical approach.** The head is exposed as for the lateral approach to the elbow joint (p. 85) by detaching the common extensor origin from the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and incising the capsule. The shaft is exposed from the front. At the upper end, brachioradialis and the two radial extensors are mobilized laterally by cutting the radial recurrent artery and any relevant muscular branches; then supinator with its underlying periosteum is carefully detached from the bone, working laterally from the radial tuberosity with the posterior interosseous nerve sandwiched within the muscle. The nerve will not be damaged if the full thickness of the muscle with its periosteum is gently retracted from the bone. Lower down, the shaft is exposed between brachioradialis laterally and flexor carpi radialis medially, while the lower end can be approached lateral to flexor carpi radialis by detaching pronator quadratus from the radius and turning it medially. Remember that the radial artery is lateral to the flexor carpi radialis tendon and the median nerve medial to it.

**Ossification.** The whole appears in cartilage at the sixth week, and a center appears in the middle of the shaft at the eighth week. At birth, both ends are cartilaginous; the lower is the growing end. A center appears in the lower end at the end of the first year, and fuses at 20 years. This epiphyseal line is extracapsular; it runs transversely through the base of the styloid process and lies above the ulnar notch. The center for the head appears at 4 years and fuses at 12; the epiphyseal line is at the junction of head and neck.

### Ulna

This is the stabilizing bone of the forearm. It obtains a good grip of the humerus, and on this foundation, the radius and hand move in pronation-supination to secure the appropriate working position for the hand. The ulna tapers in the reverse way to the radius; it is massive above and small at its distal extremity, where the head is situated (the head of the radius is at its upper end) (Figs 2.63 and 2.64).

The upper end has two projections, with a saddle-shaped articular surface between them. They are the olecranon and coronoid process, and they grip the trochlear surface of the humerus.

The olecranon is the proximal extension of the shaft, subcutaneous and easily palpable, and in extension of the elbow, it is lodged in the olecranon fossa of the humerus. Its upper surface is square, and receives the tendon of triceps over a wide area, which is smooth. Its anterior border forms a sharp undulating lip at the articular margin; the capsule of the elbow joint is attached just behind this lip. The posterior surface, triangular in shape, is subcutaneous; the olecranon bursa lies on it. The sides of the triangle are continued below the apex into the sinuous subcutaneous border of the shaft; they give attachment to the deep fascia of the forearm. The medial surface of the olecranon, gently concave, is continued down to the flexor surface of the shaft. The upper fibers of flexor digitorum profundus arise here, covered by the thin sheet of flexor carpi ulnaris, whose ulnar origin is by an aponeurosis that extends up to the medial side of the subcutaneous triangle (Fig. 2.39). At the upper angle of this area is a small smooth facet for the posterior band of the ulnar collateral (medial) ligament of the elbow (Fig. 2.26). The lateral surface of the olecranon continues down to the extensor surface of the shaft; anconeus is inserted here (Fig. 2.41).

The coronoid process projects forwards from the upper end of the shaft. Its anterior lip, like that of the olecranon, is thin and abuts on the articular margin. Medially, this lip shows a prominent smooth elevation, the sublime tubercle. Flexor digitorum superficialis is attached here, and beneath this the ulnar collateral (medial) ligament of the elbow. The ulnar nerve lies in contact with the sublime tubercle (Fig. 2.27). The anterior surface of the coronoid process is concave and receives the insertion of brachialis, the rough lower part of this surface forming the ulnar tuberosity. The medial border of the process gives a linear origin to the deep head of pronator teres. An occasional origin is given to flexor pollicis longus from either border of the coronoid process.

The lateral surface of the coronoid process carries a concave cylindrical facet, the radial notch, for the head of the radius and this surface, covered with hyaline cartilage, continues into that of the trochlear surface. The anterior and posterior margins of the notch give attachment to the annular ligament, while the quadrate ligament is attached to the shaft just below the notch. Just below this, the oblique cord is attached.

Between the projections of the olecranon and coronoid process is a deeply saddle-shaped surface, the trochlear notch. Convex from side to side, it is concave from top to bottom and fits the trochlea of the humerus. It is covered with hyaline cartilage, which is sometimes constricted in hour-glass shape or even separated into two surfaces, one on the olecranon and one on the coronoid process. The capsule and synovial membrane of the elbow joint are attached around the margins of the trochlear notch and extend to the radial notch. Thus the elbow and proximal radioulnar joints form one cavity.

The shaft is angled somewhat laterally from the line of the trochlear notch (Fig. 2.35) to form the carrying angle. It is projected at its middle into a prominent ridge, the interosseous border. The ridge fades out at the lower one-fifth of the shaft, but is continued up to the posterior lip of the radial notch. Here, just below the notch, the ridge is prominent and is named the supinator crest. Between it and the lower part of the coronoid process is a concavity that can well be called the supinator fossa. The ulnar fibers of the supinator muscle arise from the crest and the fossa. The interosseous membrane is attached to the sharp interosseous border and extends down to the distal radioulnar joint. This divides the shaft into a narrow flat extensor surface passing to the nearby subcutaneous border, and an extensive convex flexor surface passing around to the same border. Only two muscles are attached to the flexor surface. Flexor digitorum profundus, the most massive muscle of the forearm, arises high on the medial concavity of the olecranon and from the upper three-quarters of the shaft between subcutaneous and interosseous borders, and from the interosseous membrane. The bulky upper part of the belly curves the subcutaneous border into a convexity towards the radius. The subcutaneous border recovers from this curvature and extends vertically down to the styloid process. This border gives attachment to the aponeurotic head of flexor carpi ulnaris in its upper three-quarters and to the deep fascia of the forearm in its whole length. Running up from the anterior part of the styloid process is a ridge that dies out in the lower one-fifth of the shaft. Pronator quadratus arises from the radial side of this ridge and passes transversely beneath the long flexor tendons (Fig. 2.33). The narrow flat extensor surface lies between the interosseous and subcutaneous borders. It extends down from the lateral surface of the olecranon. Anconeus is received into its upper part. Below this, a vertical ridge divides the surface. Between the ridge and the interosseous border, three muscles leave shallow impressions on the bone - abductor pollicis longus, extensor pollicis longus, and extensor indicis (Fig. 2.41). Between the ridge and the subcutaneous border, the bone is bare; extensor carpi ulnaris plays over it. This muscle has an aponeurotic origin from the subcutaneous border below the insertion of anconeus.

The lower end expands into a small rounded prominence, the head of the ulna. Its distal surface and more than half of its radial circumference, covered with hyaline cartilage, form the distal radioulnar joint. A small pit at the base of the styloid process gives attachment to the apex of triangular fibrocartilage whose base is attached to the radius. This divides off the wrist joint, for the capsule is attached to the fibrocartilage. The capsule and synovial membrane of the distal radioulnar joint are attached around the articular margins but project proximally a little, deep to pronator quadratus, as the sacciform recess. The styloid process projects distally as a continuation of the subcutaneous border. Judged from the axis of the forearm, it does not project distally as far as the radial styloid, but with the supinated forearm hanging free, the carrying angle at the elbow gives an obliquity to radius and ulna that results in the two styloid processes lying at the same horizontal level (Fig. 2.63). The ulnar collateral (medial) ligament of the wrist joint is attached to the tip of the styloid process. A groove alongside the process, on the extensor surface, lodges the tendon of extensor carpi ulnaris, in its sheath, beneath the extensor retinaculum (Fig. 2.41).

**Ossification.** Cartilage at the sixth week, a center for the shaft appears at the eighth week. The head is not ossified until the sixth year. This is the growing end and does not fuse with the shaft until 20 years. The upper end is curious in that it shows only a small epiphysis at the proximal surface of the olecranon; this appears at about the tenth year and
